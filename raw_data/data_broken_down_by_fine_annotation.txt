NWF089	6B	a	2	be down for that 
NWF089	6B	c	2	football gets too much funding
NWF089	6B	o	1	i think we could
NWF089	6B	o	1	cut
NWF089	6B	a	2	right right right 
NWF089	6B	c	2	they don't they they can they don't need to be thespians
NWF089	6B	a	1	mm hm

NWF089	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF089	6B	a	2	right right right 
NWF089	6B	c	2	that's why we can cut the assistant cooks
NWF089	6B	a	1	yeah we should keep that

NWF089	6B	a	2	tha i think those are important
NWF089	6B	a	2	yes i agree okay so we cut four 
NWF089	6B	o	2	so let's cut four from everything else
NWF089	6B	o	2	i don't think reproductive education should be cut
NWF089	6B	o	2	or nor job training programs
NWF089	6B	a	1	this is gonna be the hard one
NWF089	6B	o	2	chicken pox vaccinations are pretty important
NWF089	6B	o	2	s t d education should probably not be cut
NWF089	6B	c	2	in rela in relation to the other things 
NWF089	6B	o	2	it can probably be cut
NWF089	6B	o	2	as can weed control
NWF089	6B	i	2	i'm not really sure what that means 
NWF089	6B	t	2	i'm not really sure what that means 
NWF089	6B	i	2	oh like adding on to the hospital 
NWF089	6B	r	2	mm
NWF089	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF089	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF089	6B	o	1	i think
NWF089	6B	o	3	my opinion is to cut sex offender database and neighborhood watch support 
NWF089	6B	f	3	that's but
NWF089	6B	f	2	just 
NWF089	6B	c	2	just by process of elimination

NWF089	6B	s	1	do you agree with that
NWF089	6B	r	2	maybe um
NWF089	6B	a	1	right right right
NWF089	6B	r	2	yeah 
NWF089	6B	o	2	we could cut hospital additions instead of the sex offender database 
NWF089	6B	s	2	we could cut hospital additions instead of the sex offender database 
NWF089	6B	a	2	okay
NWF089	6B	a	1	sure
NWF089	6B	a	1	invasive species
NWF089	6B	e	1	sweet
NWF089	6B	o	2	that's important 
NWF089	6B	c	2	to keep
NWF089	6B	c	1	the homeless animal population down
NWF089	6B	a	1	yeah make sure
NWF089	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWF089	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF089	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF089	6B	r	1	we'll think about it
NWF089	6B	i	2	oh 
NWF089	6B	a	2	yeah
NWF089	6B	a	1	yes i agree
NWF089	6B	a	1	yes
NWF089	6B	a	1	yeah i think it is
NWF089	6B	o	1	maybe we can
NWF089	6B	s	1	maybe we can
NWF089	6B	o	1	cut that and keep the soccer league
NWF089	6B	s	1	cut that and keep the soccer league
NWF089	6B	r	2	i don't know mm
NWF089	6B	r	1	right
NWF089	6B	r	2	i dunno 
NWF089	6B	o	2	these ones are kind of hard to pick 
NWF089	6B	c	2	because a lot of these are important 
NWF089	6B	f	2	in my opinion
NWF089	6B	a	1	no
NWF089	6B	a	1	right
NWF089	6B	a	1	right
NWF089	6B	t	0	i don't know what that means
NWF089	6B	o	2	well i think that we should choose between public news station and public access station 
NWF089	6B	o	2	i don't think we need both
NWF089	6B	a	1	sure
NWF089	6B	a	1	okay
NWF089	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF089	6B	a	1	that trend
NWF089	6B	a	1	no
NWF089	6B	a	0	so that means we would be cutting dog catcher boy's basketball club football stadium upkeep and the public access station
NWF089	6B	s	1	are you okay with those four
NWF089	6B	a	1	okay
NWF089	6B	a	1	sure 
NWF089	6B	o	1	maybe um
NWF089	6B	s	1	maybe um
NWF089	6B	o	1	instead of the boy's basketball club
NWF089	6B	s	1	instead of the boy's basketball club
NWF089	6B	a	2	okay so then we'd have both the public access station and public news station that's fine
NWF089	6B	a	2	yeah okay cool
NWF089	6B	s	0	dog catcher
NWF089	6B	a	2	okay yeah we can cut one of the animal things 
NWF089	6B	c	2	there's like f four of them 
NWF089	6B	o	2	definitely cut speed limit signs 
NWF089	6B	f	2	no i'm just kidding 
NWF089	6B	o	2	probably not a good idea
NWF089	6B	o	2	alright so teaching certificates we should keep
NWF089	6B	a	1	speed limit signs we should keep
NWF089	6B	o	1	i think
NWF089	6B	o	1	additional bus stops we should keep
NWF089	6B	c	2	because i think we can get rid of some of these licenses
NWF089	6B	o	1	like tattoo artist license
NWF089	6B	a	2	you want them to be licensed 
NWF089	6B	a	2	that's a good point actually
NWF089	6B	e	2	that's a good point actually
NWF089	6B	e	1	that's a good point
NWF089	6B	i	2	ah 
NWF089	6B	i	2	dang 
NWF089	6B	a	2	okay
NWF089	6B	r	2	we'll think about it 
NWF089	6B	i	2	man po 
NWF089	6B	o	2	that's important 
NWF089	6B	i	2	that's important 
NWF089	6B	o	2	i don't think we should cut that
NWF089	6B	a	1	i know
NWF089	6B	o	1	i personally think those could get cut
NWF089	6B	a	1	uh huh
NWF089	6B	a	2	yeah yeah sure sure sure sure
NWF089	6B	o	3	that can be cut screw that 
NWF089	6B	i	3	that can be cut screw that 
NWF089	6B	c	3	cuz cuz if we're not cutting subway system or bus then we can cut taxi
NWF089	6B	i	3	cuz cuz if we're not cutting subway system or bus then we can cut taxi
NWF089	6B	o	0	i think we ha we're at three 
NWF089	6B	c	0	cuz we're cutting
NWF089	6B	o	0	hunting tags
NWF089	6B	o	0	and taxi stops so these four

NWF089	6B	a	1	okay cool 
NWF089	6B	o	1	so we're done
NWF089	6B	o	1	that wasn't too bad
NWF089	6B	o	0	now i know why a lot of people
NWF089	6B	o	2	why it's hard it's hard to pick things to cut 
NWF089	6B	o	2	but then you can look at like politicians you think they're jerks 
NWF089	6B	c	2	but then you can look at like politicians you think they're jerks 
NWF089	6B	c	2	cuz it's like how can you cut something for animals and it's like well compared to something else 
NWF089	6B	i	2	cuz it's like how can you cut something for animals and it's like well compared to something else

NWF090	3I	o	1	we didn't leave very much room for books
NWF090	3I	d	2	oh but tra 
NWF090	3I	c	2	but they'd have room up here and up here 
NWF090	3I	a	2	okay
NWF090	3I	o	1	here we go
NWF090	3I	d	3	w no but we ha 
NWF090	3I	c	3	w no but we ha 
NWF090	3I	c	3	we're deciding right now i mean they've already started moving things in
NWF090	3I	c	3	i mean we're running i mean there must be four miles between these aisles but we're running back and forth putting th up signs where they're supposed to be 
NWF090	3I	s	3	right 
NWF090	3I	a	3	okay
NWF090	3I	a	1	yeah me too 
NWF090	3I	e	1	i like it
NWF090	3I	t	2	yeah well you could
NWF091	3I	o	1	uh let's take two or three and work work a group
NWF091	3I	o	1	i think those go with mouse traps or boating supplies somewhere on this side
NWF091	3I	o	1	and i don't much care where 
NWF091	3I	f	1	and i don't much care where 
NWF091	3I	s	1	do you think care
NWF091	3I	a	1	right 
NWF091	3I	o	1	so let's essentially put it up here 
NWF091	3I	c	1	so let's essentially put it up here 
NWF091	3I	o	1	i won't put it right next 
NWF091	3I	c	1	it is a boating supply 
NWF091	3I	o	1	we'll put it part of it 
NWF091	3I	a	1	okay 
NWF091	3I	o	1	your turn
NWF091	3I	s	1	your turn
NWF091	3I	o	1	i think it sort of household equipment
NWF091	3I	o	2	or power cords
NWF091	3I	d	1	oh i think power cords sounds good
NWF091	3I	o	1	oh i think power cords sounds good
NWF091	3I	a	1	sure
NWF091	3I	o	2	now we hafta i think it goes with the ice cream 
NWF091	3I	e	2	totally good
NWF091	3I	e	1	that was a good idea
NWF091	3I	o	1	alright that goes up here
NWF091	3I	o	1	i think this goes with mouse traps 
NWF091	3I	c	1	it's sort well it's because i think these bundles of sticks are for starting fires 
NWF091	3I	c	1	and it's sort of
NWF091	3I	c	1	things that you use in your house or your farm or whatever that are not
NWF091	3I	s	0	and you thought it was camping
NWF091	3I	a	1	well that would be okay with me
NWF091	3I	o	2	why don't we save it 
NWF091	3I	s	2	why don't we save it 
NWF091	3I	o	2	and see where we have space i think that goes with the travel guides or the toys but let's
NWF091	3I	c	2	they're right at but you know they're 
NWF091	3I	a	2	i know 
NWF091	3I	d	2	but they're 
NWF091	3I	c	2	see they're right across the aisle
NWF091	3I	o	1	sort of household equipment 
NWF091	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWF091	3I	t	1	choo
NWF091	3I	o	1	and i'm gonna put that with boating
NWF091	3I	o	1	i'm gonna save bundles of sticks
NWF091	3I	o	1	so that's like um hardware i think
NWF091	3I	a	1	sure
NWF091	3I	o	2	and bundles of sticks should go when we get to the camping equipment which we haven't got yet we'll put this with that
NWF091	3I	o	1	so i'm gonna get us more here 
NWF091	3I	c	1	cuz i'm holding on to this one
NWF091	3I	o	1	that's the gardening stuff
NWF091	3I	o	1	well i would put it here
NWF091	3I	a	2	okay 
NWF091	3I	o	2	so here is our two camping things backpacks 
NWF091	3I	c	2	unless we're gonna say backpacks are school supplies 
NWF091	3I	d	2	unless we're gonna say backpacks are school supplies 
NWF091	3I	o	2	in which case they should be near toys and books maybe 
NWF091	3I	c	2	in which case they should be near toys and books maybe 
NWF091	3I	o	2	and then i think there's going to be paper in there
NWF091	3I	o	2	let's decide they're school supplies
NWF091	3I	f	2	yeah 
NWF091	3I	d	2	but target 
NWF091	3I	c	2	but target 
NWF091	3I	f	2	yeah 
NWF091	3I	d	2	but target has uh everything
NWF091	3I	c	2	but target has uh everything
NWF091	3I	o	2	let's we're gonna have school supplies in this area
NWF091	3I	a	1	yep
NWF091	3I	r	2	uh a whole liter is pretty big 
NWF091	3I	c	2	uh a whole liter is pretty big 
NWF091	3I	o	2	it could either be drinking water 
NWF091	3I	c	2	it could either be drinking water 
NWF091	3I	o	2	we can put it over here 
NWF091	3I	o	2	or it could be like for um
NWF091	3I	c	2	or it could be like for um
NWF091	3I	o	0	uh distilled water for
NWF091	3I	c	0	uh distilled water for
NWF091	3I	o	0	things you use you know your iron and stuff
NWF091	3I	c	0	things you use you know your iron and stuff
NWF091	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWF091	3I	c	1	it could be anyway
NWF091	3I	a	1	it could be anyway
NWF091	3I	a	1	sure
NWF091	3I	a	2	yep for sure that goes there 
NWF091	3I	i	2	uh oh 
NWF091	3I	o	2	we haven't left any room for this
NWF091	3I	r	1	i don't 
NWF091	3I	d	1	i can't move it once i put it up
NWF091	3I	o	2	i'm good at we have not left any place for clothes
NWF091	3I	o	1	i think maybe opposite over here 
NWF091	3I	c	1	because we haven't really got another aisle for it 
NWF091	3I	o	1	we don't want em with sugar and cake mixes if we don't can help it 
NWF091	3I	c	1	we don't want em with sugar and cake mixes if we don't can help it 
NWF091	3I	s	1	do we
NWF091	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWF091	3I	o	2	so it could be i don't want it by siding much i'd rather have it opposite boating
NWF091	3I	f	1	i don't know 
NWF091	3I	s	1	what do you think
NWF091	3I	o	2	we're gonna have a lot of clothes i mean three or four things it seems to me 
NWF091	3I	c	2	socks vests
NWF091	3I	o	1	so it's gonna be arbitrary is what it comes down to we could have it
NWF091	3I	a	2	no 
NWF091	3I	o	2	but we could have it
NWF091	3I	o	1	sort of opposite here 
NWF091	3I	c	1	because this is personal things and clothes are personal
NWF091	3I	f	2	i mean it's not ve it's not 
NWF091	3I	o	2	i wouldn't organize a store this way 
NWF091	3I	t	2	i wouldn't organize a store this way 
NWF091	3I	c	2	but we're sorta stuck
NWF091	3I	t	2	but we're sorta stuck
NWF091	3I	o	2	or we could put it below here
NWF091	3I	o	2	or we could put thick sweaters over with camping when we get to camping
NWF091	3I	s	2	do you want to do that and have the 
NWF091	3I	o	2	do you want to do that and have the 
NWF091	3I	d	2	nah

NWF091	3I	o	2	they can go up opposite if we need to rolls of duct tape is gonna go with mouse traps
NWF091	3I	o	2	i don't know what that is for but 
NWF091	3I	o	2	i guess it's a supply
NWF091	3I	f	2	i guess it's a supply
NWF091	3I	a	1	oh okay

NWF091	6B	a	2	the community news if we absolutely have to
NWF091	6B	r	2	the community news if we absolutely have to
NWF091	6B	a	2	soup kitchen if we absolutely have to 
NWF091	6B	r	2	soup kitchen if we absolutely have to 
NWF091	6B	d	2	no
NWF091	6B	f	1	i i don't know 
NWF091	6B	c	1	you probably get something from your city council member
NWF091	6B	c	1	that is more about how he voted and what he's doing for you
NWF091	6B	o	1	let's
NWF091	6B	o	1	do 
NWF091	6B	f	1	i mean 
NWF091	6B	c	1	we can always put it back 
NWF091	6B	o	1	let's say community news goes
NWF091	6B	o	1	kitten and puppy adoption i just think
NWF091	6B	o	2	would be a real last choice
NWF091	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF091	6B	o	2	soup kitchens might get picked up by somebody else 
NWF091	6B	c	2	soup kitchens might get picked up by somebody else 
NWF091	6B	o	2	housing assistance has to happen
NWF091	6B	a	1	yep 
NWF091	6B	o	1	i think that the dog catcher has to happen
NWF091	6B	a	1	sure
NWF091	6B	a	1	that's right
NWF091	6B	c	2	so i don't think that the county
NWF091	6B	c	1	pays very much for basketball clubs 
NWF091	6B	o	1	i think that can go
NWF091	6B	o	1	the public access station let's assume that is wi fi and internet access
NWF091	6B	d	2	no d i don do 
NWF091	6B	s	2	you think that's it
NWF091	6B	d	2	not channel nine 
NWF091	6B	c	2	it may be that i you know channel twenty seven or something like that
NWF091	6B	o	1	let that go
NWF091	6B	c	1	that's not useful
NWF091	6B	a	0	right
NWF091	6B	a	0	yep
NWF091	6B	a	0	okay
NWF091	6B	o	1	and maybe the football stadium
NWF091	6B	f	1	and maybe the football stadium
NWF091	6B	o	1	alright so we're gonna l aim for four or five on one of these other lists
NWF091	6B	s	1	take your pick
NWF091	6B	o	1	see i think it's gonna get harder when we get into some of these things
NWF091	6B	o	1	well let's do infrastructure and licensing and i say take out tattoo artist licenses
NWF091	6B	a	1	yeah i know
NWF091	6B	o	2	i would i wouldn't take out anything on that list if i could help it
NWF091	6B	a	1	oh yeah i'd take out taxi stops
NWF091	6B	o	1	i'd take out 
NWF091	6B	c	1	wha how much does that cost
NWF091	6B	s	1	wha how much does that cost
NWF091	6B	o	1	we wouldn't have to we couldn't have to do that
NWF091	6B	o	0	yes
NWF091	6B	c	0	so that if you go to a licensed massage person they've had some training
NWF091	6B	o	1	i would only take two out of that list
NWF091	6B	o	1	the taxi stops and the additional bus stops
NWF091	6B	o	1	so now let's go
NWF091	6B	o	1	to one of these other th ing 
NWF091	6B	c	1	if we only have to take two out of this list 
NWF091	6B	s	1	what are the two
NWF091	6B	o	1	and keep the community news
NWF091	6B	o	2	and the public access station isn't that redundant 
NWF091	6B	s	2	and the public access station isn't that redundant 
NWF091	6B	f	2	kind of
NWF091	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF091	6B	o	2	or we keep the public 
NWF091	6B	d	2	or we keep the public 
NWF091	6B	f	2	well
NWF091	6B	o	2	i'd let the public access station go 
NWF091	6B	c	2	it's gotta cost more than the community news
NWF091	6B	c	2	i were only gonna do two 
NWF091	6B	o	2	i might be tempted to d take both of those
NWF091	6B	a	0	yeah
NWF091	6B	a	0	stuff
NWF091	6B	o	1	we have to sort of know what kind of a county we are in 
NWF091	6B	c	1	is this a county like seattle where like king county where many city that provide services or are we is it a county like
NWF091	6B	s	1	is this a county like seattle where like king county where many city that provide services or are we is it a county like
NWF091	6B	c	0	like whatcom county or
NWF091	6B	s	0	like whatcom county or
NWF091	6B	o	0	island
NWF091	6B	c	0	i live in king county
NWF091	6B	o	2	alright we're gonna assume it's king county and that there are services provided by the city
NWF091	6B	c	2	alright we're gonna assume it's king county and that there are services provided by the city
NWF091	6B	c	2	and by other agencies like the boys and girls club 
NWF091	6B	o	2	so let's take out the junior soccer league and the boys basketball club
NWF091	6B	o	2	and keep all the informational things 
NWF091	6B	a	2	so we're only doing two right
NWF091	6B	s	1	let's do what 
NWF091	6B	o	1	public health
NWF091	6B	s	1	public health
NWF091	6B	a	1	and you can wait
NWF091	6B	c	1	and you can wait
NWF091	6B	f	1	awhile
NWF091	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF091	6B	r	2	well but that in some ways but they almost always require matching money i think
NWF091	6B	c	2	well but that in some ways but they almost always require matching money i think
NWF091	6B	c	2	they're not gonna build the hospital based only on federal money
NWF091	6B	d	2	they're not gonna build the hospital based only on federal money
NWF091	6B	a	1	they might
NWF091	6B	r	1	they might
NWF091	6B	a	1	they might
NWF091	6B	r	1	they might
NWF091	6B	d	2	but we could always postpone a year
NWF091	6B	o	2	but we could always postpone a year
NWF091	6B	d	2	only
NWF091	6B	d	1	well it's king county hospital
NWF091	6B	c	1	well it's king county hospital
NWF091	6B	a	1	right
NWF091	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF091	6B	d	1	but i think it
NWF091	6B	c	1	but i think it
NWF091	6B	c	1	it used to be king county hospital 
NWF091	6B	s	1	is it still harborview
NWF091	6B	c	0	but it but it it is operated by king county 
NWF091	6B	d	0	but it but it it is operated by king county 
NWF091	6B	s	0	right
NWF091	6B	a	0	oh right
NWF091	6B	a	0	right
NWF091	6B	c	0	state
NWF091	6B	c	1	institution it probably gets state money and
NWF091	6B	c	1	federal money and
NWF091	6B	o	1	let's see if it'll come back
NWF091	6B	d	2	well the thi but my feeling is that the
NWF091	6B	f	2	well the thi but my feeling is that the
NWF091	6B	o	2	a hospital addition can wait
NWF091	6B	c	2	that and it's a major capital
NWF091	6B	c	2	expenditure for to create a structure
NWF091	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF091	6B	c	1	and that it's that in fact
NWF091	6B	c	2	it it doesn't belong in the same budget as all these operating on going expense
NWF091	6B	c	2	budget 
NWF091	6B	o	2	so let's take hospital additions out
NWF091	6B	o	1	we gotta come up with a second thing though 
NWF091	6B	c	1	if we're gonna stick to our two items

NWF091	6B	o	1	i hate to do that but i
NWF091	6B	c	0	i don't know how much is there but
NWF091	6B	c	1	on that principle that we know there is at least one other provider

NWF096	3I	a	0	okay
NWF096	3I	o	1	um just move it up to provide space 
NWF096	3I	s	1	um just move it up to provide space 
NWF096	3I	a	1	okay 
NWF096	3I	c	1	cuz i 
NWF096	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF096	3I	c	1	cut it's it's still in its same position
NWF096	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF096	3I	a	1	yeah might 
NWF096	3I	c	1	be able to fit one more 
NWF096	3I	o	1	a very crowded store
NWF096	3I	t	1	a very crowded store
NWF096	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF096	3I	o	2	yeah it definitely needs to go

NWF096	3I	a	1	no 
NWF096	3I	c	1	so i 
NWF096	3I	a	1	okay
NWF096	3I	t	0	we're done
NWM056	3I	c	0	well that's that's sort of a
NWM056	3I	c	1	camping or sundries thing
NWM056	3I	o	1	might be easier if we like s
NWM056	3I	c	2	cuz she did they didn't say that we had to do it in any order 
NWM056	3I	o	2	i would say maybe start with the food items that seems to me make more sense 
NWM056	3I	c	2	because these are hard 
NWM056	3I	o	2	i don't know where these are gonna go
NWM056	3I	c	2	i don't know where these are gonna go
NWM056	3I	c	2	cuz i 
NWM056	3I	f	2	you know 
NWM056	3I	c	2	i don't think there was any rule that said
NWM056	3I	c	2	there there's a food item 
NWM056	3I	o	2	i would put that with the food items
NWM056	3I	o	2	sugar and ice cream
NWM056	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM056	3I	o	2	maybe here 
NWM056	3I	s	2	maybe here

NWM056	3I	s	2	right
NWM056	3I	c	2	but we can't move them
NWM056	3I	c	2	cuz the sugar is and the cake mix is there 
NWM056	3I	o	2	i'd put them together
NWM056	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWM056	3I	c	2	in a real grocery store they'd be in the same aisle
NWM056	3I	a	1	that sounds good 
NWM056	3I	c	1	cuz it they're both sort of baking supplies
NWM056	3I	o	2	well how bout this fishing net and boating supplies 
NWM056	3I	s	2	well how bout this fishing net and boating supplies 
NWM056	3I	s	2	you think those make goo make sense

NWM056	3I	c	2	the eggs that would be w like with the dairy dairy refrigerator 
NWM056	3I	o	2	ice cream and eggs should be together i'd put them together but
NWM056	3I	o	1	i guess it w could go either here or here 
NWM056	3I	s	1	no
NWM056	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWM056	3I	c	2	cuz th the baking baking supplies should all be together

NWM056	3I	c	2	i mean although in rea reality beets would be in with the with the produce
NWM056	3I	c	1	and soybeans would be are dry
NWM056	3I	a	2	yeah maybe if we could make a little produce aisle down there 
NWM056	3I	o	2	yeah maybe if we could make a little produce aisle down there 
NWM056	3I	a	2	okay
NWM056	3I	c	1	i think there were a lot of

NWM056	3I	x	2	fish hooks 
NWM056	3I	e	2	there we go 
NWM056	3I	o	2	there's a there's a natural fit for fish hooks right next to the fishing net
NWM056	3I	o	2	how bout th with the bagels
NWM056	3I	s	2	how bout th with the bagels
NWM056	3I	a	1	that would make sense huh

NWM056	6B	o	1	we can be generous and not you know cut three or four things
NWM056	6B	a	2	acting coaches yeah
NWM056	6B	c	2	i would say that acting coaches i mean i know the school of drama would disagree with us but i really don't see how public funds should be spent on acting coaches
NWM056	6B	o	2	i would say that acting coaches i mean i know the school of drama would disagree with us but i really don't see how public funds should be spent on acting coaches
NWM056	6B	c	2	oh i assume this is a city department 
NWM056	6B	s	2	right 
NWM056	6B	c	2	we're we're essentially working for a city 
NWM056	6B	o	2	i think an acting coach is some something that could be cut
NWM056	6B	o	2	okay so we're cutting one there at least
NWM056	6B	s	2	okay so we're cutting one there at least
NWM056	6B	c	2	i'm not quite sure how weed control is a public health issue 
NWM056	6B	o	2	i'm not quite sure how weed control is a public health issue 
NWM056	6B	c	2	i mean if there's too many weeds in public areas how does that jeopardize people's health
NWM056	6B	s	2	i mean if there's too many weeds in public areas how does that jeopardize people's health
NWM056	6B	a	2	i would too 
NWM056	6B	c	2	you know i could argue that if it's in a play area with children you don't want toxic weed killers all over the grass anyway if they're playing on the grass
NWM056	6B	o	2	so i would say no to the weed control
NWM056	6B	i	0	i don't know
NWM056	6B	i	0	a public access station
NWM056	6B	o	0	that's the only thing i can think is a public access 
NWM056	6B	o	0	would that be like a place where you would go to get information about your community services or something
NWM056	6B	s	0	would that be like a place where you would go to get information about your community services or something
NWM056	6B	o	0	like a like a a community center where they would have literature and handouts like for instance voting pamphlets and things like that you would get normally at a library
NWM056	6B	s	0	like a like a a community center where they would have literature and handouts like for instance voting pamphlets and things like that you would get normally at a library
NWM056	6B	c	2	since since neither one of us knows what a public access station is 
NWM056	6B	o	2	i think we could probably cut it 
NWM056	6B	c	2	unless somebody can tell us what it is
NWM056	6B	b	0	hm
NWM056	6B	s	1	community news ads 
NWM056	6B	a	1	yeah i agree

NWM058	3I	c	0	so these are already baked
NWM058	3I	c	1	and these are two things

NWM058	3I	o	2	well that's a pretty funny looking store 
NWM058	3I	c	2	but it makes some sense
NWM058	3I	t	2	but it makes some sense
NWM058	3I	o	1	there's just lots of empty aisles
NWM058	3I	t	1	there's just lots of empty aisles
NWM058	3I	d	2	beets

NWF098	6B	c	2	well they seem the same to me 
NWF098	6B	o	2	so it seems like we c that invasive species removal and weed control are redundant
NWF098	6B	c	2	so it seems like we c that invasive species removal and weed control are redundant
NWF098	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF098	6B	o	2	so let's take weed control out of public health and safety and leave the invasive species removal
NWF098	6B	o	2	those all seem important
NWF098	6B	o	2	along with hospital hospital additions and needle exchange so let's m leave those for now
NWF098	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF098	6B	o	0	i wonder if those are those marketing support programs 
NWF098	6B	c	0	y you go into a restroom and see a
NWF098	6B	c	0	um does your partner beat you sign
NWF098	6B	o	2	i'm guessing that's what that is foodbanks are essential
NWF098	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF098	6B	t	1	yeah
NWF098	6B	o	2	i think is critical
NWF098	6B	o	2	it needs to stay
NWF098	6B	o	2	foodbank is very important item for public services
NWF098	6B	o	1	think should stay 
NWF098	6B	x	1	the veterinary hospital
NWF098	6B	o	2	i would be inclined to get rid of the boys basketball club 
NWF098	6B	c	2	because you don't see a girls basketball club
NWF098	6B	c	2	is not gender specific 
NWF098	6B	o	2	so it leave that
NWF098	6B	o	2	the boys can play in the basketball they find a good cul de sac
NWF098	6B	c	2	the boys can play in the basketball they find a good cul de sac
NWF098	6B	o	2	the drainage ditches need to stay
NWF098	6B	o	2	fishing licenses i think are fine
NWF098	6B	o	2	meh
NWF098	6B	o	2	i would say the towing services
NWF098	6B	o	2	why is the city paying for that
NWF098	6B	c	2	why is the city paying for that
NWF098	6B	o	2	or the county
NWF098	6B	c	2	or the county
NWF098	6B	o	1	so hunting tags can stay
NWF098	6B	o	1	go lightrail
NWF098	6B	o	2	that definitely needs to stay
NWF098	6B	r	2	um 
NWF098	6B	d	2	i would say get rid of the towing services
NWF098	6B	c	0	it's n right next to the the bus and the train station
NWF098	6B	o	1	do we want to go for a second
NWF098	6B	s	1	do we want to go for a second
NWF098	6B	c	1	well they have
NWF098	6B	c	2	in public health and safety there's the reproductive education and the s t d education
NWF098	6B	c	2	assuming those are the same thing 
NWF098	6B	o	2	we could get rid of
NWF098	6B	a	1	yes
NWF098	6B	o	2	let's get rid of the
NWF098	6B	o	2	acting coaches
NWF098	6B	a	1	sure
NWF098	6B	d	2	i still have my eye on that community news ads
NWF098	6B	o	2	i still have my eye on that community news ads
NWF098	6B	r	2	yeah 
NWF098	6B	d	2	but then 
NWF098	6B	c	2	they're all things being equal
NWF098	6B	o	2	drainage ditches we need
NWF098	6B	o	1	we could get rid of those um taxi stops
NWF098	6B	a	1	okay
NWF098	6B	e	0	alright so we've cut
NWF098	6B	e	0	we've cut two from each one
NWF098	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF098	6B	c	2	if we increase the stray cat spaying 
NWF098	6B	o	2	we won't need any of the kitty adoption
NWF098	6B	o	2	increase the dog catcher
NWM058	6B	s	0	how do you wanna attack this
NWM058	6B	o	1	like category by category or
NWM058	6B	s	1	like category by category or
NWM058	6B	a	1	okay
NWM058	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM058	6B	o	2	i i hate cutting education 
NWM058	6B	r	2	but let's see here
NWM058	6B	o	2	well i can think of 
NWM058	6B	x	2	so we 
NWM058	6B	c	2	there's some things you just can't cut
NWM058	6B	c	2	you need to keep the school clean 
NWM058	6B	o	2	so you can't cut the custodians
NWM058	6B	c	2	special ed teachers are probably a federal requirement and so are note takers for disabled kids 
NWM058	6B	o	2	so those three are safe 
NWM058	6B	f	2	i think
NWM058	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM058	6B	c	1	i would say if i had to axe on of these it would probably be that
NWM058	6B	a	1	i would say if i had to axe on of these it would probably be that
NWM058	6B	a	1	so yeah sugar free juice machines are out
NWM058	6B	o	2	public health hate to cut there too but let's see
NWM058	6B	x	0	i
NWM058	6B	s	1	don't know about you 
NWM058	6B	f	1	don't know about you 
NWM058	6B	x	1	but um
NWM058	6B	o	1	the invasive species or weed control is the one 
NWM058	6B	f	1	i don't know which one but i'd
NWM058	6B	o	1	i don't know which one but i'd
NWM058	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM058	6B	o	1	so we kill one of them and let the other program take up the slack or
NWM058	6B	s	1	so we kill one of them and let the other program take up the slack or
NWM058	6B	a	1	okay
NWM058	6B	a	1	okay
NWM058	6B	a	1	that sounds good
NWM058	6B	t	0	i don't even really know what that is
NWM058	6B	f	0	i mean i know what community news is 
NWM058	6B	s	0	but what what do the mean by the ads
NWM058	6B	o	2	that should be under public health
NWM058	6B	c	2	as long as not upkeeping the football stadium doesn't mean it falls to bits
NWM058	6B	r	2	as long as not upkeeping the football stadium doesn't mean it falls to bits
NWM058	6B	c	2	and it only means it gets you know a little old
NWM058	6B	r	2	and it only means it gets you know a little old
NWM058	6B	a	1	that's true
NWM058	6B	o	1	killing the stadium upkee keep to add a girls 
NWM058	6B	c	1	killing the stadium upkee keep to add a girls 
NWM058	6B	f	1	but anyway
NWM058	6B	x	1	we can 
NWM058	6B	a	1	sure let's kill the basketball club 
NWM058	6B	c	1	we can
NWM058	6B	a	1	we can
NWM058	6B	c	1	play uh
NWM058	6B	a	1	play uh
NWM058	6B	c	1	basketball somewhere else 
NWM058	6B	a	1	basketball somewhere else 
NWM058	6B	f	1	i guess
NWM058	6B	o	2	you can't really
NWM058	6B	o	2	dispense with teaching certificates
NWM058	6B	o	2	and the speed limit signs do too
NWM058	6B	a	2	and the speed limit signs do too
NWM058	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM058	6B	c	2	i'm not really sure why this city is
NWM058	6B	c	2	doing that
NWM058	6B	a	1	yeah i'd probably axe the towing services
NWM058	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM058	6B	c	1	if we're just getting rid of one
NWM058	6B	o	2	axe the taxi stops 
NWM058	6B	c	2	i'm not every sure what the city is doing
NWM058	6B	a	2	oh right
NWM058	6B	a	2	now i forgot we'd agreed on that 
NWM058	6B	o	2	i'm still not sure what the city's doing or the county's doing with taxi stops 
NWM058	6B	a	2	but um yeah towing services is can go first
NWM058	6B	x	0	mm
NWM058	6B	c	1	or maybe it's lost parking revenue or something
NWM058	6B	d	1	i don't know if we need to
NWM058	6B	a	2	oh yeah 
NWM058	6B	o	2	that's redundant
NWM058	6B	o	2	i'd say get rid of s t d 
NWM058	6B	c	2	since it should be covered in reproductive
NWM058	6B	s	0	oh we're getting rid of another one there
NWM058	6B	a	1	okay
NWM058	6B	t	1	okay well you never know 
NWM058	6B	a	1	oh yeah acting coaches that's fine

NWF103	6B	c	2	since it's
NWF103	6B	c	0	it's li it's either

NWF103	6B	c	2	i mean or else the the pounds are gonna
NWF103	6B	c	2	get filled up 
NWF103	6B	o	2	yeah
NWF103	6B	o	1	yeah
NWF103	6B	o	1	yeah i think so
NWF103	6B	f	1	i don't know 
NWF103	6B	o	1	mark like on that one um
NWF103	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF103	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF103	6B	o	1	yeah
NWF103	6B	c	2	i think it's because we don't really know what community news ads are or the public access station
NWF103	6B	c	2	i think that the community news ads would are like
NWF103	6B	c	2	would become less essential
NWF103	6B	c	2	moving into the future 
NWF103	6B	o	2	so let's cut that one
NWF103	6B	o	1	needs to stay
NWF103	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF103	6B	a	1	hm
NWF103	6B	c	2	why do we need additional bus stops 
NWF103	6B	o	2	question mark yeah
NWF103	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF103	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF103	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF103	6B	o	1	yeah
NWF103	6B	a	1	mmhm
NWF103	6B	a	1	yeah i i don't know
NWF103	6B	o	1	sounds kind of important
NWF103	6B	c	0	like s there are some places on the road that are designated taxi stops instead of parking spaces like usually they're in front of like clubs or and stuff like that or at the airport
NWF103	6B	o	1	i guess that's kind of important
NWF103	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF103	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF103	6B	c	1	i guess i've seen them like
NWF103	6B	c	2	i saw a few in boston once or like in summerville which is just outside boston but i guess its not really like that essential i'm sure that the city will you know move on like without the the taxi stops cuz the p the parking spaces that open up could generate more revenue
NWF103	6B	o	1	we can question mark on that one
NWF103	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWF103	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF103	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF103	6B	o	2	we probably didn't cut that much out of the budget 
NWF103	6B	t	2	we probably didn't cut that much out of the budget 
NWF103	6B	c	2	but you know what that's that was the minimum that they were asking
NWF103	6B	t	2	but you know what that's that was the minimum that they were asking
NWF103	6B	o	1	i think that's it
NWF105	3I	o	1	food 
NWF105	3I	s	1	food 
NWF105	3I	a	1	sure

NWF105	3I	a	1	sure
NWF105	3I	s	1	does that seem right to you
NWF105	3I	a	1	sure
NWF105	3I	o	1	next t power cords
NWF105	3I	s	1	next t power cords
NWF105	3I	o	1	next to tweezers
NWF105	3I	s	1	next to tweezers
NWF105	3I	a	1	okay

NWF105	3I	o	1	by the bags of peat moss
NWF105	3I	s	1	by the bags of peat moss
NWF105	3I	s	1	do you think

NWF105	3I	a	1	sure
NWF105	3I	o	1	also that same aisle 
NWF105	3I	s	1	mayb
NWF105	3I	a	1	sure
NWF105	3I	a	1	sounds good
NWF105	3I	o	1	next to the toothpaste
NWF105	3I	s	1	next to the toothpaste
NWF105	3I	o	1	next to the juice
NWF105	3I	s	2	you think
NWF105	3I	o	1	next to the buckets
NWF105	3I	s	1	next to the buckets
NWF105	3I	o	2	that'd be good near the boating supplies 
NWF105	3I	c	2	but i don't know if we have don't know if that counts it'll kinda hang off the top of the aisle
NWF105	3I	o	1	next to the heavy cables 
NWF105	3I	s	1	do you think
NWF105	3I	o	2	i feel like that should all go in the same area
NWF105	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWF105	3I	o	1	somewhere in that first aisle
NWF105	3I	a	1	sure
NWF105	3I	a	1	yep
NWF105	3I	o	1	maybe somewhere
NWF105	3I	f	1	i don't know 
NWF105	3I	o	1	i was gonna say by the refrigerator magnet and random
NWF105	3I	f	1	i don't really know
NWF105	3I	c	2	so far that doesn't seem to match any
NWF105	3I	c	2	categories that we have
NWF105	3I	a	1	yeah that's true
NWF105	3I	a	1	sure 
NWF105	3I	c	1	be our catchall
NWF105	3I	o	2	i say that goes by refrigerator magnets too 
NWF105	3I	c	2	that's the random stuff
NWF105	3I	a	1	sure yeah
NWF105	3I	o	1	or 
NWF105	3I	c	1	already put it i was 
NWF105	3I	o	1	gonna say by backpacks and books it coulda been good too but that's fine
NWF105	3I	o	2	somewhere in that first aisle i would say
NWF105	3I	a	1	sure yeah d right there that sounds good
NWF105	3I	o	1	how bout next to the siding
NWF105	3I	s	1	how bout next to the siding
NWF105	3I	a	1	sure
NWF105	3I	o	1	somewhere in that same area
NWF105	3I	o	1	oh that goes near
NWF105	3I	o	2	backpacks 
NWF105	3I	s	2	do you think 
NWF105	3I	c	2	is that like outdoor backpacking or
NWF105	3I	s	2	is that like outdoor backpacking or
NWF105	3I	o	1	cooking
NWF105	3I	o	1	by the
NWF105	3I	o	1	cake mix
NWF105	3I	o	1	same place
NWF105	3I	s	1	same place
NWF105	3I	o	1	like the same place to me
NWF105	3I	s	2	yeah
NWF105	3I	c	2	socks are kinda random 
NWF105	3I	o	2	put them by the pet food 
NWF105	3I	c	2	we don't have anything down there
NWF105	3I	a	1	okay
NWF105	3I	o	2	and shoelaces too
NWF105	3I	s	2	and shoelaces too
NWF105	3I	b	1	hm 
NWF105	3I	a	1	sure the clothing and pet food section
NWF105	3I	a	1	sounds good
NWF105	3I	a	1	sure
NWF105	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWF105	3I	o	1	somewhere over 
NWF105	3I	a	1	there sure
NWF105	3I	o	2	somewhere over in that first aisle yeah
NWF105	3I	a	2	sure
NWF105	3I	c	2	maybe it's 
NWF105	3I	c	2	maybe it's fishing books 
NWF105	3I	t	2	maybe it's fishing books 
NWF105	3I	o	2	eh just put it next to the books
NWF105	3I	i	2	eh just put it next to the books
NWF105	3I	c	2	close enough
NWF105	3I	o	2	pre cut wood should also go over here
NWF105	3I	o	1	over here
NWF105	3I	s	1	over here
NWF105	3I	o	1	over here too
NWF105	3I	s	1	over here too
NWF105	3I	o	2	or is that more over here
NWF105	3I	s	2	or is that more over here
NWF105	3I	o	2	let's put it over here
NWF105	3I	o	2	so over here too
NWF105	3I	o	2	feel like our pet food's kinda
NWF105	3I	t	2	feel like our pet food's kinda
NWF105	3I	o	2	outta place there
NWF105	3I	t	2	outta place there
NWF105	3I	a	1	no
NWF105	3I	o	2	i don't think we're very good at organizing stores based on one item at a time but that's okay
NWF105	3I	t	2	i don't think we're very good at organizing stores based on one item at a time but that's okay
NWF104	3I	s	0	so basically these simulate aisles
NWF104	3I	o	1	so i would 
NWF104	3I	f	1	i guess 
NWF104	3I	o	1	put it on the last row with food
NWF104	3I	s	1	up to you
NWF104	3I	o	1	i would say next to yeah the toilet paper
NWF104	3I	o	1	that looks good there yeah
NWF104	3I	o	1	power c cords
NWF104	3I	s	1	power c cords
NWF104	3I	o	1	maybe next to boating supplies
NWF104	3I	s	1	maybe next to boating supplies
NWF104	3I	o	1	probably nex 
NWF104	3I	a	1	yeah on the same
NWF104	3I	a	1	yep
NWF104	3I	o	1	should probably be saying these too
NWF104	3I	t	1	should probably be saying these too
NWF104	3I	a	1	yep
NWF104	3I	a	1	oh yeaho
NWF104	3I	o	1	i think books can be next to
NWF104	3I	o	1	the travel guides or
NWF104	3I	o	1	food
NWF104	3I	o	1	toilet paper
NWF104	3I	s	1	toilet paper
NWF104	3I	a	1	that makes sense 
NWF104	3I	t	1	which i still don't know what is that
NWF104	3I	d	2	or maybe
NWF104	3I	o	2	next to the mousetraps
NWF104	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF104	3I	a	1	okay
NWF104	3I	o	1	right here next to packages of cookies
NWF104	3I	s	1	right here next to packages of cookies
NWF104	3I	a	1	alright
NWF104	3I	a	1	yep
NWF104	3I	a	1	mm hm
NWF104	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF104	3I	a	1	mm hm
NWF104	3I	a	1	alright
NWF104	3I	c	2	seems like a camping or outdoors thing 
NWF104	3I	o	2	next to
NWF104	3I	s	2	this 
NWF104	3I	o	2	next to the bundles of sticks
NWF104	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF104	3I	o	2	it seems like the empty plastic jugs could've been with large cups 
NWF104	3I	f	2	maybe i don't know
NWF104	3I	i	2	hm 
NWF104	3I	o	2	or maybe i'll just put it here next to th
NWF104	3I	o	1	refrigerator magnets
NWF104	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF104	3I	o	1	how bout next to toys
NWF104	3I	s	1	how bout next to toys
NWF104	3I	o	1	next to backpacks or
NWF104	3I	s	1	next to backpacks or
NWF104	3I	o	1	or n siding or
NWF104	3I	s	1	or n siding or
NWF104	3I	o	1	next to the box knives
NWF104	3I	s	1	next to the box knives
NWF104	3I	a	1	mm hm
NWF104	3I	a	1	uh huh
NWF104	3I	a	1	that makes sense
NWF104	3I	a	1	yep
NWF104	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF104	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF104	3I	f	1	i guess yeah we can put on
NWF104	3I	a	1	i guess yeah we can put on
NWF104	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF104	3I	o	2	in the clothing section
NWF104	3I	o	1	large vests
NWF104	3I	o	1	maybe next to the shoe area
NWF104	3I	o	1	next to this
NWF104	3I	s	1	next to this
NWF104	3I	o	2	next to the fishing net
NWF104	3I	c	2	we can't do that right
NWF104	3I	s	2	we can't do that right
NWF104	3I	a	1	alright
NWF104	3I	a	1	okay
NWF104	3I	a	1	okay
NWF104	3I	c	2	cuz there's no room here so
NWF104	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF104	3I	o	2	it wouldn't be good to put it with the human food
NWF104	3I	t	2	it wouldn't be good to put it with the human food
NWF105	6B	o	1	well should we start with education programs
NWF105	6B	s	1	well should we start with education programs
NWF105	6B	a	1	i do too
NWF105	6B	c	1	they're all gonna s be important
NWF105	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF105	6B	o	2	okay so assistant cooks is a possibility to cut 
NWF105	6B	s	2	right
NWF105	6B	c	1	seems pretty important to me 
NWF105	6B	o	1	custodians are pretty important
NWF105	6B	o	2	i'm biased i think it's really important
NWF105	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF105	6B	c	1	that's something that
NWF105	6B	c	1	could be fundraised for
NWF105	6B	o	2	okay so potentially two
NWF105	6B	o	1	i would kinda cut it but
NWF105	6B	a	1	okay
NWF105	6B	a	1	it is for sure 
NWF105	6B	o	1	let's see
NWF105	6B	a	1	yep
NWF105	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF105	6B	o	2	cooking classes could be cut
NWF105	6B	c	2	can learn how to do that at home
NWF105	6B	o	2	that could be cut too theoretically
NWF105	6B	c	1	do you think it's important
NWF105	6B	s	1	do you think it's important
NWF105	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF105	6B	b	1	mm hm
NWF105	6B	a	0	yeah
NWF105	6B	a	1	i agree
NWF105	6B	a	1	i agree
NWF105	6B	o	1	i think music is important for sure
NWF105	6B	s	1	so which ones do you wanna cut for sure
NWF105	6B	o	2	i think we're really in agreement about football equipment
NWF105	6B	o	1	acting coaches
NWF105	6B	s	1	acting coaches
NWF105	6B	a	1	agree
NWF105	6B	a	1	yeah assistant cooks
NWF105	6B	o	1	cooking classes
NWF105	6B	s	1	cooking classes
NWF105	6B	o	1	do you agree
NWF105	6B	s	1	do you agree
NWF105	6B	o	1	do those seem
NWF105	6B	s	1	do those seem
NWF105	6B	s	1	should we
NWF105	6B	o	1	think we're
NWF105	6B	a	1	yes we are 
NWF105	6B	i	1	alright
NWF105	6B	a	0	i think so
NWF105	6B	o	0	maybe it's
NWF105	6B	o	1	i don't know
NWF105	6B	c	1	well i guess theoretically if we already have it 
NWF105	6B	o	1	we could cut it 
NWF105	6B	s	1	right
NWF105	6B	f	1	i don't know
NWF105	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWF105	6B	r	2	i well 
NWF105	6B	c	2	i didn't get a chicken pox vaccination i think a lot of kids just naturally get chicken pox and then they're fine
NWF105	6B	f	1	don't they
NWF105	6B	s	1	don't they
NWF105	6B	a	1	i think 
NWF105	6B	f	1	i mean
NWF105	6B	o	2	yeah i think that's really mm hm that's
NWF105	6B	a	1	i don't think so 
NWF105	6B	c	1	i think you
NWF105	6B	c	1	m most people just get it when they're a kid and then
NWF105	6B	f	1	i could be wrong though
NWF105	6B	o	1	potentially we could cut that one let's keep going
NWF105	6B	f	1	i don't know
NWF105	6B	o	1	it's important but i'm not sure if it's on the top of the list
NWF105	6B	o	2	potentially pretty important
NWF105	6B	a	1	that's true
NWF105	6B	a	1	and reproductive education
NWF105	6B	o	2	well we could theoretically cut one or the other of those and makes the other one take over
NWF105	6B	o	2	that's really important
NWF105	6B	s	1	do you wanna read them
NWF105	6B	o	1	important i think
NWF105	6B	s	0	do you
NWF105	6B	b	0	okay
NWF105	6B	o	1	well let's keep it for now 
NWF105	6B	c	1	in case it's important
NWF105	6B	a	1	i do too
NWF105	6B	a	1	i do too
NWF105	6B	a	1	i think so yeah 
NWF105	6B	o	1	i think that's less important
NWF105	6B	o	2	very important that's
NWF105	6B	o	2	that's pretty important 
NWF105	6B	c	2	so if we were to get rid of four
NWF105	6B	o	2	i think chicken pox
NWF105	6B	o	1	invasive species
NWF105	6B	s	1	invasive species
NWF105	6B	o	1	one of the educations either reproductive or s t d 
NWF105	6B	s	1	do you agree
NWF105	6B	a	1	okay
NWF105	6B	s	0	oh really
NWF105	6B	r	2	well i wonder if reproductive has to do with
NWF105	6B	c	2	well i wonder if reproductive has to do with
NWF105	6B	r	1	like even
NWF105	6B	c	1	like even
NWF105	6B	r	1	childbirth and
NWF105	6B	c	1	childbirth and
NWF105	6B	r	1	caring for children
NWF105	6B	c	1	caring for children
NWF105	6B	c	1	like you know
NWF105	6B	c	1	pre natal care
NWF105	6B	o	1	well weed control f we can take out
NWF105	6B	o	1	we need one more
NWF105	6B	a	1	sure 
NWF105	6B	c	1	since we don't know what it
NWF105	6B	o	1	that's a good thing 
NWF105	6B	f	1	know
NWF105	6B	a	1	okay
NWF105	6B	o	1	that's pretty important
NWF105	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF105	6B	a	1	yeah that is true
NWF105	6B	c	1	i know a lot of churches run food banks too
NWF105	6B	b	1	mm hm
NWF105	6B	b	0	yeah
NWF105	6B	o	2	oh i like the idea 
NWF105	6B	c	2	but that is something that could be cut
NWF105	6B	f	1	i don't know
NWF105	6B	c	2	as far as the level importance it seems less important than soup kitchens to me
NWF105	6B	a	1	stays yeah 
NWF105	6B	o	1	housing assistance think stays
NWF105	6B	o	1	i don't know
NWF105	6B	o	1	i don't know if that's important or not 
NWF105	6B	c	1	i've never really been exposed that much that
NWF105	6B	o	1	so
NWF105	6B	o	1	potentially we could ki cut it
NWF105	6B	o	2	i'd rather keep the soccer league 
NWF105	6B	c	2	cuz it sounds like it's for everyone
NWF105	6B	c	1	than the basketball club
NWF105	6B	b	0	okay
NWF105	6B	o	1	that's important 
NWF105	6B	c	1	but it also doesn't seem like it'd be fun funded by the community
NWF105	6B	c	1	by the county rather
NWF105	6B	c	1	so if we're to cut four
NWF105	6B	o	0	we kinda said
NWF105	6B	o	1	kitten and puppy adoption
NWF105	6B	s	1	right
NWF105	6B	o	1	dog catcher
NWF105	6B	s	1	do we agree
NWF105	6B	a	1	boy's basketball club
NWF105	6B	a	1	sure 
NWF105	6B	c	1	we'll we'll let a private one take over
NWF105	6B	a	1	i agree
NWF105	6B	a	1	i agree
NWF105	6B	o	1	that's helpful
NWF105	6B	a	1	yeah that's true
NWF105	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF105	6B	b	0	uh huh
NWF105	6B	a	1	okay
NWF105	6B	c	2	but it's not very important to me personally so
NWF105	6B	o	1	maybe
NWF105	6B	o	1	so potent potentially t additional bus stops and tattoo artist licenses

NWF104	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF104	6B	r	1	hm

NWF104	6B	f	2	i don't know 
NWF104	6B	o	2	sugar free juice machines doesn't seem as important as the other things
NWF104	6B	c	2	sugar free juice machines doesn't seem as important as the other things

NWF104	6B	c	2	isn't it more serious as an adult if
NWF104	6B	s	2	isn't it more serious as an adult if
NWF104	6B	c	1	but i guess it's not really
NWF104	6B	s	1	but i guess it's not really
NWF104	6B	c	1	important then
NWF104	6B	s	1	important then
NWF104	6B	a	1	alright
NWF104	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF104	6B	c	2	sounds like the other thing like sex ed and reproductive
NWF104	6B	c	2	education why is it all in different categories

NWF104	6B	c	2	i mean for which city is this for for seattle there's a lot of
NWF104	6B	c	0	transit in this area 
NWF104	6B	o	0	so
NWF104	6B	o	1	i would
NWF104	6B	c	2	for seattle 
NWF104	6B	o	2	i wouldn't fund more for that
NWF104	6B	o	2	so i would get rid of that
NWF104	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF104	6B	o	1	so we could cut that
NWF104	6B	s	1	so we could cut that
NWF104	6B	c	2	yeah boating licenses seems more important than a tattoo artist license
NWF104	6B	o	2	pothole maintenance 
NWF104	6B	c	2	cuz seattle has lot's of potholes

NWF104	6B	i	1	um
NWF104	6B	o	1	not really that important i guess
NWF104	6B	f	1	not really that important i guess
NWF104	6B	a	1	mm
NWF104	6B	a	1	alright
NWF104	6B	a	1	alright
NWF104	6B	i	1	alright
NWF104	6B	s	1	oh we were gonna get rid of towing services
NWF104	6B	i	1	oh we were gonna get rid of towing services
NWF104	6B	r	2	yeah i gue
NWF104	6B	o	2	i guess so
NWF104	6B	a	2	i guess so
NWF106	3I	o	1	here just put it on the table
NWF106	3I	x	1	alright
NWF106	3I	x	2	siding
NWF106	3I	a	1	yeah which is good
NWF106	3I	b	0	kay
NWF106	3I	o	1	this gets more into that kind of um
NWF106	3I	o	1	stuff
NWF106	3I	o	1	maybe with toilet paper
NWF106	3I	s	1	maybe with toilet paper
NWF106	3I	c	1	as a um personal hygiene item
NWF106	3I	a	1	that's what i thought ma magnets yeah
NWF106	3I	c	1	do we have any clothing items up here at all
NWF106	3I	s	1	do we have any clothing items up here at all
NWF106	3I	o	2	well what we could do then is maybe make this room
NWF106	3I	s	2	well what we could do then is maybe make this room
NWF106	3I	a	1	kay
NWF106	3I	a	1	that's right 
NWF106	3I	c	1	we get three at a time
NWF106	3I	o	1	ah here
NWF106	3I	o	2	hats and light jackets should definitely go together
NWF106	3I	c	2	well knowing what might be in there
NWF106	3I	c	2	i think if we end up with all the hats and sweaters and
NWF106	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWF106	3I	o	2	that would all be over here
NWF106	3I	b	0	hm
NWF106	3I	o	1	which would be with the shoes
NWF106	3I	c	2	cuz we have axes matches
NWF106	3I	o	3	um for this arrangement we have identified no area for clothing
NWF106	3I	c	2	well this is foods of all kinds so far except for pet food
NWF106	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWF106	3I	o	2	this
NWF106	3I	o	2	could be and this could all be this is
NWF106	3I	f	2	i don't know 
NWF106	3I	c	2	it seems like this area is open 
NWF106	3I	o	2	and we could put clothing in there
NWF106	3I	o	1	wetsuits
NWF106	3I	s	1	wetsuits
NWF106	3I	a	1	kay
NWF106	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWF106	3I	c	1	there's a whole bunch of
NWF106	3I	d	2	hats and jackets should go with clothing of whatever
NWF106	3I	o	2	hats and jackets should go with clothing of whatever
NWF106	3I	c	2	cuz we're remember we also have shoes
NWF106	3I	r	2	see i don't know 
NWF106	3I	c	2	when i think about a store i don't think about going to
NWF106	3I	c	2	different areas i think about
NWF106	3I	c	3	ab one of these big stores
NWF106	3I	c	3	all the clothing is in one area
NWF106	3I	o	2	so i wouldn't separate jackets out into boating supplies 
NWF106	3I	c	2	cuz it would be w
NWF106	3I	d	2	but this isn't
NWF106	3I	d	2	but they're 
NWF106	3I	a	2	oh okay
NWF106	3I	d	2	that's not how i would
NWF106	3I	d	2	design a store though
NWF106	3I	a	1	mm hm
NWF106	3I	d	2	well these are the utilities
NWF106	3I	c	2	well these are the utilities
NWF106	3I	a	2	i think so 
NWF106	3I	d	2	but i wouldn't mix up
NWF106	3I	o	2	well i just think they need to
NWF106	3I	o	3	there just needs to be an area that can be dedicated to clothing wherever we decide
NWF106	3I	s	2	you know what i mean 
NWF106	3I	c	2	cuz if if you just walk down you looked at toys ran into clothes pet food or whether you do
NWF106	3I	a	1	that'd be fine
NWF106	3I	a	1	sure
NWF106	3I	a	1	alright
NWF106	3I	o	2	this all seems like this
NWF106	3I	a	1	sure
NWF106	3I	o	2	f i think all those go doesn't matter
NWF106	3I	o	1	i don't think it matters where those go
NWF106	3I	a	1	sure
NWF106	3I	o	1	this could be with mousetraps or
NWF106	3I	o	2	so these have to go over here somewhere and shoelaces goes with shoes if we ever get any
NWF106	3I	a	1	can't move them yep
NWF106	3I	d	2	well no 
NWF106	3I	c	2	they have to be with our f
NWF106	3I	c	2	clothing
NWF106	3I	c	2	which could be on this side too 
NWF106	3I	s	2	remember
NWF106	3I	o	2	wherever shoes are is where shoelaces would be
NWF106	3I	a	1	exactly 
NWF106	3I	s	1	so what do you think with these
NWF106	3I	o	2	think this is good and bagels would be
NWF106	3I	o	2	really it's own thing 
NWF106	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWF106	3I	a	2	there you go i like the sound of that
NWF106	3I	t	2	there you go i like the sound of that
NWF106	3I	a	2	i think so
NWF106	3I	o	2	and this was definitely something around here 
NWF106	3I	s	2	right
NWF106	3I	o	2	right here right here
NWF106	3I	t	2	apparently we've been to uh
NWF106	3I	t	2	large stores together before
NWF106	3I	o	2	soap 
NWF106	3I	i	2	ooh cookies
NWF106	3I	o	1	right there maybe
NWF106	3I	s	1	right there maybe
NWF106	3I	a	2	sure
NWF106	3I	o	1	maybe here
NWF106	3I	s	1	maybe here
NWF106	3I	i	2	ooh butter
NWF106	3I	o	2	that'd be next to eggs
NWF106	3I	a	1	yep
NWF106	3I	x	1	oh very good small axes okay
NWF106	3I	a	1	no
NWF106	3I	o	1	these are all gonna be
NWF106	3I	o	1	okay
NWF106	3I	a	1	yeah i think so
NWF106	3I	o	1	and those are
NWF106	3I	o	1	gonna go on that side too
NWF106	3I	a	1	very good
NWF106	3I	a	1	sure
NWF106	3I	c	2	i th i think anybody who's looking for that s is gonna go through that whole aisle
NWF106	3I	a	1	mm hm that'd be good
NWF106	3I	o	1	maybe by toys or by travel guides
NWF106	3I	r	2	well 
NWF106	3I	o	2	this could be here
NWF106	3I	a	1	yeah i agree
NWF106	3I	c	2	see that's the problem with having it here and not in a larger area
NWF106	3I	c	2	so if we're doing this 
NWF106	3I	o	2	i think we should
NWF106	3I	a	1	that's true
NWF106	3I	o	2	then this could be boots and this is clothing
NWF106	3I	a	1	works for me
NWF106	3I	s	1	what about beets 
NWF106	3I	o	1	maybe here
NWF106	3I	s	1	maybe here
NWF106	3I	d	2	no 
NWF106	3I	c	2	this is veggies
NWF106	3I	o	2	i think don doughnuts will be
NWF106	3I	o	1	next to sugar
NWF106	3I	s	1	next to sugar
NWF106	3I	t	1	that's funny
NWF106	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWF106	3I	e	2	i like where you stuck it
NWF106	3I	o	2	well the on the other side 
NWF106	3I	c	2	the little kiddies won't know and the parents could pick it up while their kids are shopping
NWF106	3I	a	1	alright
NWF106	3I	o	2	i could actually
NWF106	3I	a	1	well that's true
NWF106	3I	o	1	i think it's fine there
NWF106	3I	d	2	we don't want it next to all the
NWF106	3I	d	2	we don't want it next to here 
NWF106	3I	c	2	cuz we don't want people doing a whole buncha 
NWF106	3I	a	2	yeah

NWF106	3I	t	1	whole buncha drinking while you

NWF106	3I	r	1	yeah maybe
NWF106	3I	o	2	i don't think we have anything else pet related

NWF106	3I	a	1	okay
NWF106	3I	o	1	and duct tape could be
NWF106	3I	d	1	oh that could go by box knives though
NWF106	3I	o	1	oh that could go by box knives though
NWF106	3I	a	1	yeah

NWF106	3I	o	2	alright here's a nother good one
NWF106	3I	o	1	for maybe
NWF106	3I	o	1	this area

NWF107	3I	r	2	well you know you do have in the the far righthand corner that is a problem for the register
NWF107	3I	c	2	well you know you do have in the the far righthand corner that is a problem for the register
NWF107	3I	t	2	well you know you do have in the the far righthand corner that is a problem for the register
NWF107	3I	c	2	you'd have to have a camera on that that 
NWF107	3I	t	2	you'd have to have a camera on that that 
NWF107	3I	o	2	wasn't a good idea
NWF107	3I	t	2	wasn't a good idea
NWF107	3I	o	2	uh next to the toilet paper or the bar of soap
NWF107	3I	s	2	uh next to the toilet paper or the bar of soap

NWF107	3I	o	1	here
NWF107	3I	o	2	yeah there's a fishing section then w then you get the power cords
NWF107	3I	b	0	mm hm
NWF107	3I	b	0	okay
NWF107	3I	a	1	that makes sense to me
NWF107	3I	o	1	would that go
NWF107	3I	s	1	would that go
NWF107	3I	o	1	here
NWF107	3I	s	1	here
NWF107	3I	o	1	or this sh
NWF107	3I	s	1	or this sh
NWF107	3I	s	1	what else would be pet related
NWF107	3I	c	2	we can only look at three though
NWF107	3I	o	2	i think maybe
NWF107	3I	r	2	well this is near the power cord though
NWF107	3I	c	2	well this is near the power cord though
NWF107	3I	c	2	and you need the tubing to cover the electrical and the duct tape's just practical
NWF107	3I	o	1	right here
NWF107	3I	s	1	right here
NWF107	3I	a	1	right that makes more sense
NWF107	3I	o	2	yeah these were the ones we're walking for
NWF107	3I	b	0	okay
NWF107	3I	o	1	how bout here 
NWF107	3I	s	1	how bout here 
NWF107	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWF107	3I	o	1	small saws near the
NWF107	3I	o	2	away from the toy section
NWF107	3I	c	1	kitchen it's a kitchen item too 
NWF107	3I	o	1	how bout here 
NWF107	3I	s	1	how bout here 
NWF107	3I	c	1	those are all practical
NWF107	3I	o	1	how bout these guys
NWF107	3I	s	1	how bout these guys
NWF107	3I	o	2	that's a little unkind visually
NWF107	3I	o	2	i think maybe bundles of sticks here
NWF107	3I	d	2	well no 
NWF107	3I	c	2	plastic jugs
NWF107	3I	o	1	i think maybe
NWF107	3I	o	1	here
NWF107	3I	r	2	well wouldn't you wanna put them near the beverages
NWF107	3I	s	2	well wouldn't you wanna put them near the beverages
NWF107	3I	c	2	well wouldn't you wanna put them near the beverages
NWF107	3I	f	2	well
NWF107	3I	r	2	well that's all food though
NWF107	3I	c	2	well that's all food though
NWF107	3I	c	0	when you're in a hurry for something
NWF107	3I	c	0	you go look where for cups
NWF107	3I	s	0	you go look where for cups
NWF107	3I	s	1	where would the foil aisle be in this
NWF107	3I	a	1	yeah i agree
NWF107	3I	o	1	how bout
NWF107	3I	s	1	how bout
NWF107	3I	o	1	something across the way would be logical
NWF107	3I	s	1	something across the way would be logical
NWF107	3I	o	1	empty plastic jugs
NWF107	3I	c	1	well once we place it 
NWF107	3I	s	1	so what else we got
NWF107	3I	o	1	bottles of juice would be
NWF107	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF107	3I	s	1	don't you think
NWF107	3I	c	1	near 
NWF107	3I	r	1	uh well wait m yeah
NWF107	3I	o	2	these guys should go together 
NWF107	3I	a	2	yeah that would be good
NWF107	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF107	3I	o	1	so large cups could go
NWF107	3I	o	1	wherever we want them
NWF107	3I	o	2	it's th it's the outlier though
NWF106	6B	o	1	alright so let's look at the first one and see if there's anything that we can agree on first column
NWF106	6B	o	1	of one thing
NWF106	6B	o	1	that needs to be
NWF106	6B	o	1	that can be cut i should say
NWF106	6B	o	2	i think for me it's very easily to say the sugar free juice machines
NWF106	6B	c	2	because i don't really th see a need to have any type of
NWF106	6B	c	2	juice machine in any school anywhere they can drink water
NWF106	6B	o	1	okay so there's our one thing 
NWF106	6B	s	1	right
NWF106	6B	s	1	alright you wanna read that list for us
NWF106	6B	b	0	okay
NWF106	6B	s	0	do any of these jump out as
NWF106	6B	s	0	easiest to cut
NWF106	6B	a	1	yeah nei me neither
NWF106	6B	b	0	yep
NWF106	6B	o	1	well maybe it should be w
NWF106	6B	o	1	well maybe we should say weed control
NWF106	6B	o	1	could be the first to go
NWF106	6B	o	2	i don't understand why you need a neighborhood watch support
NWF106	6B	c	2	i mean neighborhoods can have neighborhood watches
NWF106	6B	c	2	why do you need a separate area to support
NWF106	6B	b	0	yeah
NWF106	6B	c	2	if there's a neighborhood watch and something happens they just call the police
NWF106	6B	c	2	i don't understand why you need a separate
NWF106	6B	a	2	yeah i agree
NWF106	6B	c	1	so then th
NWF106	6B	c	1	there's a question of reproductive education s t d education
NWF106	6B	c	1	those kinda seem like you could hit
NWF106	6B	c	1	two birds with one s
NWF106	6B	c	1	tone
NWF106	6B	d	2	yeah but we already have sex ed
NWF106	6B	c	2	yeah but we already have sex ed
NWF106	6B	d	2	here so the teenagers are already getting reproductive and s t d education
NWF106	6B	c	2	here so the teenagers are already getting reproductive and s t d education
NWF106	6B	c	2	so if we're talking about adults what are we trying to teach them
NWF106	6B	o	1	would be more important than
NWF106	6B	o	2	well so in that case i think
NWF106	6B	o	2	neighborhood watch support could go pre natal checkups can't go
NWF106	6B	o	2	well they could we could still just pick one
NWF106	6B	o	1	which one of those two or maybe find a third one easier
NWF106	6B	s	1	which one of those two or maybe find a third one easier
NWF106	6B	a	1	alright
NWF106	6B	o	2	now why is a veterinary hospital a public service
NWF106	6B	c	2	now why is a veterinary hospital a public service
NWF106	6B	r	2	well
NWF106	6B	o	2	why do those need to be but why do those need to be a public service 
NWF106	6B	c	2	have private
NWF106	6B	d	2	but we have private
NWF106	6B	c	2	but we have private
NWF106	6B	c	2	dog catcher typically has been a public
NWF106	6B	c	2	publicly funded but
NWF106	6B	c	2	kitten and puppy adoption is handled voluntarily by like paws and
NWF106	6B	c	2	humane society and stuff 
NWF106	6B	o	2	so i'm just unclear
NWF106	6B	c	2	right but why couldn't the dog catcher take them to the humane society
NWF106	6B	d	2	but they could
NWF106	6B	d	2	no i don't think it is 
NWF106	6B	c	2	because we have veterinary hospitals that are private
NWF106	6B	c	2	th people who have pets pay like when i i when my dog needs help i have to ta i ha take him to a hospital but it's not a
NWF106	6B	c	2	publicly funded hospital
NWF106	6B	s	2	is it
NWF106	6B	f	2	well i don't know
NWF106	6B	f	1	i don't know 
NWF106	6B	o	1	football stadium can take care of
NWF106	6B	o	2	i think we should s
NWF106	6B	o	2	i think the public could definitely handle stray cat spraying spaying
NWF106	6B	c	2	because i think that
NWF106	6B	c	2	does good like a lon
NWF106	6B	c	2	a long way
NWF106	6B	o	1	i'm just not sure why
NWF106	6B	o	2	see like soup kitchens i think are great but
NWF106	6B	c	2	those are also
NWF106	6B	c	2	private 
NWF106	6B	o	2	the list is bizarre
NWF106	6B	t	2	the list is bizarre
NWF106	6B	o	2	oh they are 
NWF106	6B	d	2	but they're not usually
NWF106	6B	c	2	but they're not usually
NWF106	6B	c	2	they're not usually
NWF106	6B	c	2	like the food banks where i grew up
NWF106	6B	c	2	they weren't the city didn't provide them with anything the food banks were run voluntarily by
NWF106	6B	c	2	bazillions of little churches that got together
NWF106	6B	o	2	so i this is just an odd list to me
NWF106	6B	c	2	cuz it's like a combination of weird things
NWF106	6B	c	2	that i wouldn't even think would be on the list why is a boys basketball clu 
NWF106	6B	o	2	oh see but that could be parks and rec
NWF106	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF106	6B	s	1	well what do you think
NWF106	6B	o	1	well i think maybe kitty kitten and puppy adoption
NWF106	6B	d	2	it'd still have to be handled though
NWF106	6B	c	2	it'd still have to be handled though
NWF106	6B	c	2	whether it's online or paper it would still be
NWF106	6B	c	2	some department somewhere responsible for it
NWF106	6B	o	2	i th said i thought kitten and puppy adoption
NWF106	6B	o	2	could be handled
NWF106	6B	o	2	not through the city
NWF106	6B	o	2	why is towing services on here
NWF106	6B	s	2	why is towing services on here
NWF106	6B	d	2	no 
NWF106	6B	c	2	but this is we're pretending that this is a city or something right
NWF106	6B	c	2	right so a city doesn't provide a towing service
NWF106	6B	d	2	no 
NWF106	6B	c	2	what they do is they call
NWF106	6B	c	2	there's a list of i know because i know how they handle this but there's a list of like all the local towing
NWF106	6B	c	2	companies
NWF106	6B	c	2	and they have to cycle through them one after another
NWF106	6B	c	2	so here's triple a se towing they call them up
NWF106	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF106	6B	c	2	that's not part of
NWF106	6B	c	2	any government service
NWF106	6B	s	2	well what do they mea what do you think 
NWF106	6B	c	2	if they mean towing services like for towing their own
NWF106	6B	c	2	vehicles
NWF106	6B	s	2	do you know what i mean like
NWF106	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF106	6B	c	1	what is taxi stops
NWF106	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF106	6B	r	2	well i
NWF106	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF106	6B	o	2	i just didn't know why towing services was on the list
NWF106	6B	a	1	huh that would make sense wouldn't it
NWF106	6B	o	1	we just need to drop one 
NWF106	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF106	6B	c	2	well that's what it depends on the definition of towing services if the definition of towing services is let's say there's a car accident and someone needs to tow the car out of the road
NWF106	6B	c	2	a private towing service
NWF106	6B	c	2	is called
NWF106	6B	a	2	right 
NWF106	6B	c	2	it's a contracted thing so that's not part of any public service
NWF106	6B	c	2	if it's means
NWF106	6B	c	2	the s city's bus
NWF106	6B	c	2	broke down
NWF106	6B	c	2	and they had to specially tow the city bus to the city parking garage so that
NWF106	6B	c	2	the city bus could
NWF106	6B	b	0	yeah
NWF106	6B	o	3	that you would have to keep 
NWF106	6B	c	3	because you can't not
NWF106	6B	c	2	tow your own
NWF106	6B	a	2	yeah right
NWF106	6B	a	2	yes 
NWF106	6B	o	2	let's call that public bus upkeep and we can drop towing services
NWF106	6B	a	1	exactly
NWF106	6B	a	2	yeah it's a big job 
NWF106	6B	c	2	you can't just call
NWF106	6B	b	1	yeah
NWF106	6B	o	1	alright well i think we're done then
NWF106	6B	f	1	unless there was anything else
NWF106	6B	a	1	it does
NWF106	6B	c	2	well that's why i think we left
NWF106	6B	c	2	this one here
NWF106	6B	c	2	and took that one out because by the time you're an adult
NWF106	6B	c	2	i th you have pre natal checkups but the time you're an adult you don't really need to know
NWF106	6B	c	2	a woman ovulates every twenty eight days and then
NWF106	6B	d	2	no i think
NWF106	6B	a	2	absolutely
NWF106	6B	c	2	and i think if any of the teachers have to go 
NWF106	6B	o	2	unfortunately for me personally it would be the acting coach
NWF106	6B	o	2	but not poetry and not um
NWF106	6B	o	2	music
NWF106	6B	o	2	or like art
NWF106	6B	c	2	i and i know that acting is one of those arts but i
NWF106	6B	c	2	somehow think that's a smaller niche than
NWF106	6B	a	1	that's true
NWF106	6B	o	2	well luckily we didn't have to take it out so we're good
NWF106	6B	b	1	yeah
NWF106	6B	a	1	yeah i think so
NWF106	6B	c	1	so our task was to simply decide which we have done and they get to
NWF106	6B	c	2	bitch and moan and that's too bad for them but
NWF106	6B	c	0	we decided
NWF106	6B	d	2	no 
NWF106	6B	c	2	that's not what it says
NWF106	6B	c	2	your task is to decide
NWF106	6B	c	2	and we appeared fair by cutting equally
NWF107	6B	t	2	this is hard
NWF107	6B	c	1	so they want us to say the words probably 
NWF107	6B	o	1	so m i'll read it
NWF107	6B	o	1	so we're starting with education first
NWF107	6B	r	0	huh
NWF107	6B	a	1	alright let's go for it i i agree with that
NWF107	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF107	6B	o	1	so we gotta get rid of one on the other side
NWF107	6B	a	1	sure
NWF107	6B	o	2	no
NWF107	6B	o	1	maybe hospital additions
NWF107	6B	s	1	maybe hospital additions
NWF107	6B	o	2	now some would say invasive species removal 
NWF107	6B	d	2	but that's really important for seattle
NWF107	6B	c	2	but that's really important for seattle
NWF107	6B	o	2	and weed control is not the same thing
NWF107	6B	o	2	but they're of the same nature
NWF107	6B	o	2	neighborhood watch support you think then definitely we have to keep pre natal checkups
NWF107	6B	o	1	and the v a
NWF107	6B	d	2	it's pretty different populations actually teenagers and adults
NWF107	6B	c	2	it's pretty different populations actually teenagers and adults
NWF107	6B	o	2	um you could combine the two
NWF107	6B	o	1	well i think maybe s t d education
NWF107	6B	t	2	oh this is really hard
NWF107	6B	c	2	well neighbors could be helping in a time of budget 
NWF107	6B	a	2	so yeah let's get rid of neighborhood watch support
NWF107	6B	b	0	hm
NWF107	6B	c	2	because it handles the d animals
NWF107	6B	c	1	public health
NWF107	6B	c	2	look you got stray cat spraying and baby and kitten puppy adoption and the veterinary hospital
NWF107	6B	c	2	it's a public service
NWF107	6B	c	2	uh to keep uh vermin down
NWF107	6B	c	2	disease control
NWF107	6B	o	2	you also have dog catcher on there
NWF107	6B	c	2	well the dog catcher picks up the puppies and the kittens and then they adopt them out
NWF107	6B	d	2	the dog catcher doesn't do that
NWF107	6B	c	2	the dog catcher doesn't do that
NWF107	6B	o	1	it would be a more humane world if they did 
NWF107	6B	a	1	yes
NWF107	6B	o	2	right so in a hypothetical world veterinary hospital would be essential
NWF107	6B	o	1	so get rid of the veterinary hospital
NWF107	6B	s	1	so get rid of the veterinary hospital
NWF107	6B	c	2	is that more important than football stadium upkeep
NWF107	6B	s	2	is that more important than football stadium upkeep
NWF107	6B	c	2	couldn't the football stadium people take care of their own upkeep
NWF107	6B	s	2	couldn't the football stadium people take care of their own upkeep
NWF107	6B	c	2	conference rooms you gotta lead a f leave a conference room clean you ha you leave a stadium clean
NWF107	6B	d	2	no those are essential for homeless
NWF107	6B	c	2	no those are essential for homeless
NWF107	6B	o	2	there aren't enough of them
NWF107	6B	b	1	yeah
NWF107	6B	o	2	you'll have to keep the junior soccer league
NWF107	6B	o	0	there has to be one thing to go
NWF107	6B	s	1	what are the community news ads 
NWF107	6B	o	1	that's important
NWF107	6B	c	2	some would say that could go online
NWF107	6B	s	0	what do you suggest
NWF107	6B	a	1	go for it
NWF107	6B	c	2	that's how you make your money
NWF107	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF107	6B	r	2	but they have to tow the cars they're
NWF107	6B	c	2	but they have to tow the cars they're
NWF107	6B	r	2	towing away to the tow yard for the parking tickets
NWF107	6B	c	2	towing away to the tow yard for the parking tickets
NWF107	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF107	6B	o	2	so that's an easy one 
NWF107	6B	o	2	you say towing system services
NWF107	6B	s	2	you say towing system services
NWF107	6B	o	1	well then taxi stops
NWF107	6B	s	1	well then taxi stops
NWF107	6B	o	2	pothole maintenance has to stay
NWF107	6B	o	2	the subway system has to stay
NWF107	6B	o	2	so you say
NWF107	6B	o	2	towing services but the public bus upkeep is important
NWF107	6B	o	2	and the drainage ditches are essential
NWF107	6B	c	2	but those drainage ditches could be maintained by
NWF107	6B	c	2	invasive species removal department
NWF107	6B	r	1	but we're down to just w one item
NWF107	6B	c	1	but we're down to just w one item
NWF107	6B	o	2	so what would you propose if the towing service people said
NWF107	6B	s	2	so what would you propose if the towing service people said
NWF107	6B	s	1	where would the towing services be absorbed into
NWF107	6B	b	0	right
NWF107	6B	a	1	the dispatcher contracted yeah
NWF107	6B	a	1	yeah y um i think i understand yeah
NWF107	6B	r	2	but wouldn't that be a part of the budget for public bus upkeep already
NWF107	6B	c	2	but wouldn't that be a part of the budget for public bus upkeep already
NWF107	6B	s	2	but wouldn't that be a part of the budget for public bus upkeep already
NWF107	6B	c	2	the towing services would be in that
NWF107	6B	s	2	the towing services would be in that
NWF107	6B	c	2	because if the public bus is stuck
NWF107	6B	c	2	or the public transportation pool is stuck 
NWF107	6B	o	2	they would have to have something big enough as a bus
NWF107	6B	o	2	that's the worst case scenario
NWF107	6B	o	1	so it looks like we identified at least two things
NWF107	6B	o	2	now i'm i'm glad that you and i agreed on that s s t d education and reproductive education 
NWF107	6B	t	2	now i'm i'm glad that you and i agreed on that s s t d education and reproductive education 
NWF107	6B	c	2	the way those are worded it makes it harder to make the choice
NWF107	6B	o	2	and sex ed is kinda the same thing but
NWF107	6B	o	2	i wonder if there's a way to involve all of them
NWF107	6B	e	2	you very thoughtful person
NWF107	6B	t	2	you very thoughtful person
NWF107	6B	e	2	it's really nice that you took that 
NWF107	6B	t	2	it's really nice that you took that 
NWF107	6B	o	2	now and we left the math tutors and the acting coaches some would say the acting coaches need to go some would say
NWF107	6B	o	2	the music teachers need to go
NWF107	6B	o	2	but i think the m
NWF107	6B	o	2	music teachers are more essential than the sugar free juice machines
NWF107	6B	b	0	yeah
NWF107	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF107	6B	d	2	it does help with social behavior
NWF107	6B	c	2	it does help with social behavior
NWF107	6B	o	2	well we didn't have to take it off
NWF107	6B	o	1	but i can see where there's a little wiggle room
NWF107	6B	e	2	you're very thoughtful person
NWF107	6B	t	2	you're very thoughtful person
NWF107	6B	s	1	so do you think we we could present to a committee 
NWF107	6B	o	1	and would seem
NWF107	6B	t	1	and would seem
NWF107	6B	o	1	i i think we've done
NWF107	6B	t	1	i i think we've done
NWF107	6B	o	1	done well
NWF107	6B	t	1	done well
NWF107	6B	d	2	or we are trying to move others to help
NWF107	6B	c	2	or we are trying to move others to help
NWF107	6B	b	0	yeah
NWF107	6B	a	1	we did
NWF107	6B	o	2	i like that method actually
NWF108	3I	o	1	should we take these outta the box first and organize them into categories
NWF108	3I	s	1	should we take these outta the box first and organize them into categories
NWF108	3I	o	2	let's just kinda

NWF108	6B	o	2	football equipment
NWF108	6B	a	2	i could go with sugar free juice machines 
NWF108	6B	r	2	i'm not sure about the assistant cooks 
NWF108	6B	c	2	because we're talking about the school lunches and the thing is that educational programs have so many um free and reduced lunch programs
NWF108	6B	c	2	and breakfast programs 
NWF108	6B	o	2	so yeah
NWF108	6B	a	2	that's right i agree with that
NWF108	6B	o	1	what about acting coaches
NWF108	6B	s	1	what about acting coaches
NWF108	6B	a	1	it is
NWF108	6B	a	1	yeah

NWF108	6B	a	1	can see if there are two okay
NWF108	6B	d	2	why
NWF108	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF108	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWF108	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF108	6B	o	2	and it's um it 
NWF108	6B	a	2	is important
NWF108	6B	o	2	uh all of them kind of are important but i suppose
NWF108	6B	c	2	i mean if i knew more about bagel factories i would know how important um the inspections are why that is picked is it picked 
NWF108	6B	x	2	did they stick it on there just because it was a stand out that was an obvious one
NWF108	6B	t	2	did they stick it on there just because it was a stand out that was an obvious one
NWF108	6B	o	2	but all the rest of em um yeah
NWF108	6B	o	2	that's one i was thinking about
NWF108	6B	c	2	we just don't know the situation
NWF108	6B	o	2	we need that yeah
NWF108	6B	o	1	bagel the bagel factory inspections 
NWF108	6B	a	1	and the hospital additions yeah
NWF108	6B	o	2	definitely there's no um
NWF108	6B	c	2	i mean we're assuming that each one of em has the same monetary value which is hardly the fact 
NWF108	6B	o	2	but that's okay okay so on to recreation and public services
NWF108	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF108	6B	o	2	well i could probably vote for football stadium upkeep 
NWF108	6B	c	2	if we're gonna vote for football equipment on the other hand we may be making enemies by totally attacking the football folks if we gave them their stadium upkeep
NWF108	6B	c	2	they may forgive us
NWF108	6B	c	2	so i'm wondering why the county needs a veterinary hospital
NWF108	6B	c	2	or does it need the hospital for the spaying and the
NWF108	6B	f	1	i don't know 
NWF108	6B	o	1	i'm i'm not sure a county needs a veterinary hospital

NWF110	6B	a	0	maybe it's in the schools
NWF110	6B	c	0	yeah when i was a kid we were the assistant cooks
NWF110	6B	o	1	well i would sort of
NWF110	6B	o	1	start out with the sugar free juice machines
NWF110	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF110	6B	o	1	i'm sorta thinking
NWF110	6B	o	0	if we took five from each one it would be a third of a
NWF110	6B	c	0	if we took five from each one it would be a third of a
NWF110	6B	o	1	that might be a little excessive 
NWF110	6B	s	1	huh
NWF110	6B	a	1	okay
NWF110	6B	a	0	okay
NWF110	6B	o	2	lot easier 
NWF110	6B	c	2	cuz 
NWF110	6B	o	2	we can get rid of sugar for juice machines
NWF110	6B	o	1	we can get rid of
NWF110	6B	f	1	in my opinion 
NWF110	6B	o	1	we can get rid of football equipment
NWF110	6B	r	2	well it
NWF110	6B	b	1	yeah
NWF110	6B	*	1	yeah
NWF110	6B	c	2	well and i i don't know if this is adult education as well it may be teaching people who are diabetic to cook in a responsible way 
NWF110	6B	o	2	we like the music teachers probably math tutors are pretty good sex education i think is critical
NWF110	6B	a	1	maybe 
NWF110	6B	c	1	we could have the kids in the schools do the assisting or they could be custodians
NWF110	6B	b	0	yeah
NWF110	6B	o	2	well quite honestly you probably could cut that one 
NWF110	6B	c	2	cuz you could just buy quicken
NWF110	6B	o	1	well for starters we're d going to do the three sugar football equipment
NWF110	6B	o	1	and assistant cooks
NWF110	6B	s	1	and assistant cooks
NWF110	6B	c	0	did three 
NWF110	6B	t	0	did three 
NWF110	6B	o	0	we're done
NWF110	6B	t	0	we're done
NWF110	6B	o	2	we definitely need that i like
NWF110	6B	o	2	i'm in favor of
NWF110	6B	o	2	we definitely need that gosh we kinda need that 
NWF110	6B	o	2	probably need that
NWF110	6B	i	2	probably need that
NWF110	6B	c	1	you know i don't like bagels 
NWF110	6B	t	1	you know i don't like bagels 
NWF110	6B	o	1	so it'd be fine with me if we didn't do bagel factory
NWF110	6B	t	1	so it'd be fine with me if we didn't do bagel factory
NWF110	6B	c	1	well maybe they inspect them for kosherness 
NWF110	6B	t	1	well maybe they inspect them for kosherness 
NWF110	6B	f	1	i dunno
NWF110	6B	t	1	i dunno
NWF110	6B	b	0	yeah
NWF110	6B	o	2	well they wanna know if we say bagel 
NWF110	6B	c	2	like my sister does in new york city she says bagel 
NWF110	6B	o	2	we'd like that i think a sex offender database is really pretty useless quite honestly well you can't cut that 
NWF110	6B	c	2	cuz then the human cry would go off
NWF110	6B	c	1	well neighborhood watch support i'm afraid they've cut that already
NWF110	6B	o	1	i was gonna say neighbors do it we on their own 
NWF110	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF110	6B	o	1	we can get rid of that one 
NWF110	6B	s	1	can't we 
NWF110	6B	o	1	i'm happy to get rid of bagel factories 
NWF110	6B	b	1	yeah 
NWF110	6B	o	1	so we just have to find one more
NWF110	6B	o	1	if i were looking at this i'd look at hospital additions
NWF110	6B	c	2	children's has just finished theirs they don't
NWF110	6B	t	2	children's has just finished theirs they don't
NWF110	6B	b	1	yeah 
NWF110	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF110	6B	a	1	yeah i agree i agree 
NWF110	6B	i	1	now
NWF110	6B	i	0	oh yeah
NWF110	6B	t	0	oh yeah
NWF110	6B	t	0	the nude as i recall
NWF110	6B	c	2	well if it's that 
NWF110	6B	o	2	i could get rid of that that would be alright with me 
NWF110	6B	c	2	i wouldn't wanna get rid of k u o w
NWF110	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF110	6B	f	1	i dunno 
NWF110	6B	o	1	junior soccer league 
NWF110	6B	f	1	i dunno if we need that
NWF110	6B	o	1	i dunno if we need that
NWF110	6B	o	2	i think the boys' basketball club 
NWF110	6B	c	2	they don't have a girls' anything
NWF110	6B	o	2	so i think we c don't fund that until they make it co ed 
NWF110	6B	c	2	so i think we c don't fund that until they make it co ed 
NWF110	6B	b	2	yeah yeah
NWF110	6B	a	1	oh okay
NWF110	6B	a	2	oh okay 
NWF110	6B	o	2	let's get rid of the public access 
NWF110	6B	c	2	we don't need that
NWF110	6B	c	2	see i'm not a big football fan 
NWF110	6B	o	2	i'd probably get rid of the football stadium upkeep
NWF110	6B	o	2	pest control we need spaying we need food banks we need kitten and puppy adoption i guess we don't need 
NWF110	6B	c	2	but we've got all those puppies and kittens because nobody's spaying
NWF110	6B	c	1	and neutering their
NWF110	6B	a	1	it is yeah
NWF110	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF110	6B	c	2	that's where we've gotten all our 
NWF110	6B	t	2	that's where we've gotten all our 
NWF110	6B	o	2	soup kitchens we need
NWF110	6B	r	2	well i th 
NWF110	6B	o	2	how about boys' basketball and leave junior soccer 
NWF110	6B	s	2	how about boys' basketball and leave junior soccer 
NWF110	6B	c	2	it's very popular now and
NWF110	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF110	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF110	6B	*	1	yeah
NWF110	6B	b	2	mm hm 
NWF110	6B	o	2	and then we can choose betw 
NWF110	6B	f	2	as far as i'm concerned 
NWF110	6B	o	2	either football stadium
NWF110	6B	o	1	or
NWF110	6B	c	2	why would we have to be supporting the veterinary hospital if we're supporting the spaying and neutering
NWF110	6B	s	2	why would we have to be supporting the veterinary hospital if we're supporting the spaying and neutering
NWF110	6B	b	1	yeah
NWF110	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF110	6B	o	2	i could cut the veterinary hospital probably
NWF110	6B	o	2	pothole maintenance we definitely need
NWF110	6B	o	2	interesting 
NWF110	6B	c	2	since we don't have one really in seattle
NWF110	6B	o	1	well then we'd like that 
NWF110	6B	o	1	could we agree on flagpole repair not being the highest priority
NWF110	6B	c	1	could we agree on flagpole repair not being the highest priority
NWF110	6B	s	1	could we agree on flagpole repair not being the highest priority
NWF110	6B	o	1	way down there 
NWF110	6B	a	1	okay so that's one we could get rid of
NWF110	6B	c	2	since they're cutting our bus services right and left 
NWF110	6B	o	2	maybe we don't need additional stops
NWF110	6B	c	2	well as long as they're not funding the busses it 
NWF110	6B	o	2	doesn't 
NWF110	6B	o	2	might be chicken and egg 
NWF110	6B	f	2	i don't know 
NWF110	6B	o	2	oh i suppose what's 
NWF110	6B	i	2	oh i suppose what's 
NWF110	6B	o	2	the greater public good fishing licenses massage certificates tattoo artist licenses
NWF110	6B	s	2	the greater public good fishing licenses massage certificates tattoo artist licenses
NWF110	6B	o	1	i guess we need 
NWF110	6B	c	1	cuz people keep
NWF110	6B	c	2	now why do we have to pay for taxi stops
NWF110	6B	b	0	okay
NWF110	6B	b	0	no
NWF110	6B	b	0	right
NWF110	6B	a	1	yeah i was gonna say the the port oughta run that 
NWF110	6B	c	1	yeah i was gonna say the the port oughta run that 
NWF110	6B	o	1	okay so we're gonna get rid of taxi stops and flagpole repair
NWF110	6B	s	1	and then what else do we think we could do 
NWF110	6B	o	1	additionally bus stops
NWF110	6B	s	1	additionally bus stops
NWF110	6B	s	1	is that okay 
NWF110	6B	a	1	alright
NWF110	6B	o	1	we're done
NWF110	6B	o	2	somebody
NWF110	6B	t	2	somebody
NWM066	6B	b	0	mm
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah i would t i agree i agree 
NWM066	6B	o	1	i think those are nice 
NWM066	6B	c	1	but it's not something you really i mean all these other things need it need it more if we use that 
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM066	6B	a	0	mm
NWM066	6B	o	1	oh we try for three
NWM066	6B	o	1	see if that goes 
NWM066	6B	o	1	then if we can't handle 
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM066	6B	a	1	absolutely we know that's true
NWM066	6B	a	2	yeah i think that's true 
NWM066	6B	c	2	because there are any number of sources for that money
NWM066	6B	o	2	although you don't wanna go to those sources there they are
NWM066	6B	o	1	i also think that um
NWM066	6B	o	1	i was gonna say cooking classes 
NWM066	6B	c	1	but that's i guess that's actually really useful stuff 
NWM066	6B	c	1	i i grew up with that and i mean our high school had home
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah that's it 
NWM066	6B	b	1	yeah 
NWM066	6B	b	1	yeah you're 
NWM066	6B	a	1	right
NWM066	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWM066	6B	o	1	so maybe it's the assistant cooks
NWM066	6B	s	1	so maybe it's the assistant cooks
NWM066	6B	b	1	yeah
NWM066	6B	b	2	yeah 
NWM066	6B	o	2	this is interesting 
NWM066	6B	c	2	because we're uh volunteering at our neighborhood elementary school you can see all this stuff going into the big public big public you know elementary school 
NWM066	6B	o	2	it's really fun 
NWM066	6B	c	2	that's a real skill 
NWM066	6B	r	2	i just
NWM066	6B	o	2	i just
NWM066	6B	r	1	i don't like 
NWM066	6B	o	1	i don't like 
NWM066	6B	o	1	so well i guess you just don't fund it 
NWM066	6B	c	1	cuz you'd have to get someone
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah okay 
NWM066	6B	o	1	we did three 
NWM066	6B	a	1	we did three okay 
NWM066	6B	a	1	alright
NWM066	6B	t	1	alright
NWM066	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWM066	6B	a	1	mh hm
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM066	6B	c	1	why do we need to inspect bagel factories
NWM066	6B	o	0	it's jus
NWM066	6B	r	2	but it doesn't 
NWM066	6B	c	2	i mean bakeries are bakeries and you know they they don't
NWM066	6B	c	0	they get r they get the regular um health inspection
NWM066	6B	b	0	huh
NWM066	6B	a	0	yeah
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah yeah
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM066	6B	c	1	and it's something that you can it depends on what you're funding if you're funding somebody to organize it or make it happen 
NWM066	6B	o	1	it still happens
NWM066	6B	a	1	neighbors do it anyway
NWM066	6B	a	1	okay so we got one
NWM066	6B	a	1	bagels
NWM066	6B	a	2	additions i would too yeah
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM066	6B	a	2	yeah right 
NWM066	6B	c	2	they've just they've got a big one 
NWM066	6B	t	2	they've just they've got a big one 
NWM066	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM066	6B	c	2	well it means yeah it means they have to go to private sources instead of government
NWM066	6B	o	2	i think not building a wing in a hospital is
NWM066	6B	o	2	i mean th that's okay 
NWM066	6B	c	2	compared to removing some of these other things 
NWM066	6B	o	2	i mean it's really yeah
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM066	6B	o	1	we did three there 
NWM066	6B	a	1	okay
NWM066	6B	c	0	i'm wondering if it's like the thing the s someone was reminding me of this yesterday that seattle had this thing that was an open station do you remember that on television on cable and anybody could sign up and you had all these wackos that were there doing half hour shows 
NWM066	6B	f	0	i don't 
NWM066	6B	f	0	i don't know if um that's what it means

NWM066	6B	a	2	yeah yeah yeah
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah yeah
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah right
NWM066	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM066	6B	c	2	it's actually a huge service
NWM066	6B	a	1	i mean yeah 
NWM066	6B	c	1	we've been in to see that and it's really 
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM066	6B	a	1	yeah right exactly 
NWM066	6B	t	1	yeah right exactly 
NWM066	6B	s	1	did we cut junior soccer league

NWF111	3I	o	2	it looks we have better organization than we did on our lists
NWF111	3I	o	1	do you think we should group the foods together should we put the preserve foods differently from the fresh foods
NWF111	3I	s	1	do you think we should group the foods together should we put the preserve foods differently from the fresh foods
NWF111	3I	o	1	you know these are
NWF111	3I	o	2	these are groceries there's definitely groceries
NWF111	3I	b	0	mm hm
NWF111	3I	o	2	yeah they're probably dried would be my guess
NWF111	3I	a	1	yeah that looks like a good choice to me
NWF111	3I	b	1	okay alright
NWF111	3I	o	2	fish hooks that looks like it would probably go pretty much right there
NWF111	3I	o	1	with the boating supplies
NWF111	3I	o	1	oh we get to pick that ourselves
NWF111	3I	o	1	should we put clothes in the middle
NWF111	3I	s	1	should we put clothes in the middle
NWF111	3I	o	1	well there was paper and scissors that could maybe be grouped with that
NWF111	3I	o	1	um so these are sorta more sundries i think
NWF111	3I	s	1	um so these are sorta more sundries i think
NWF111	3I	o	1	so yeah maybe h
NWF111	3I	o	1	so that could go here 
NWF111	3I	a	1	mm hm
NWF111	3I	o	1	so we'll put the clothes here sort of opposite some of the travel stuff
NWF111	3I	s	1	so we'll put the clothes here sort of opposite some of the travel stuff
NWF111	3I	a	1	no
NWF111	3I	o	1	so that's kind of household items 
NWF111	3I	s	1	maybe
NWF111	3I	o	1	maybe could go on this side with the mousetraps
NWF111	3I	s	1	maybe could go on this side with the mousetraps
NWF111	3I	c	1	these are more sporting and hardware 
NWF111	3I	o	1	these are more sporting and hardware 
NWF111	3I	f	1	perhaps

NWF111	3I	s	1	over here 
NWF111	3I	c	1	i'm thinking hardware type buckets
NWF111	3I	c	0	but that's kind of a
NWF111	3I	c	1	tool a house tool
NWF111	3I	o	1	boy our grab and go section and our bathroom section's filling up fast

NWF111	3I	c	1	running out of space around some of these columns
NWF111	3I	o	1	that'd go over there
NWF111	3I	o	1	over here maybe
NWF111	3I	s	1	over here maybe
NWF111	3I	b	0	yeah
NWF111	3I	r	2	maybe 
NWF111	3I	c	2	i mean we still have the
NWF111	3I	o	1	i think that would go in this section here
NWF111	3I	o	2	let's let's change this 
NWF111	3I	i	2	let's let's change this 
NWF111	3I	o	2	let's put the this one down here by the pet food

NWF111	3I	i	2	yeah 
NWF111	3I	o	2	i think we've got it
NWF111	3I	o	2	i think we have a much better store than we started out with
NWF111	3I	t	1	we're all in agreement on that
NWF112	3I	s	1	one at a time
NWF112	3I	a	1	okay
NWF112	3I	a	1	okay pull one out
NWF112	3I	o	1	over he
NWF112	3I	a	2	we much better
NWF112	3I	t	2	we much better
NWF112	3I	c	2	these are refrigerated these are refrigerated
NWF112	3I	c	0	box
NWF112	3I	c	0	bag
NWF112	3I	c	1	we don't know if those are
NWF112	3I	a	1	dried
NWF112	3I	o	1	i would say canned peas would be going over here some place
NWF112	3I	a	1	okay
NWF112	3I	o	1	we'll leave space to put more
NWF112	3I	c	1	we'll leave space to put more
NWF112	3I	o	1	boating supplies
NWF112	3I	s	1	boating supplies
NWF112	3I	a	1	okay

NWF112	3I	o	1	there were toys 
NWF112	3I	o	1	i don't remember that much else to go with toys
NWF112	3I	c	1	i don't remember that much else to go with toys
NWF112	3I	a	1	okay
NWF112	3I	c	2	oh and we also have to have space for the bathroom supplies 
NWF112	3I	o	2	okay there's the bathroom there
NWF112	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF112	3I	c	2	cuz i don't think it would go i tha to me that's more refrigerated siding
NWF112	3I	r	2	unless 
NWF112	3I	o	2	unless 
NWF112	3I	d	2	no
NWF112	3I	o	1	i would th you could put it down with mousetraps
NWF112	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF112	3I	o	2	my favorite
NWF112	3I	t	2	my favorite
NWF112	3I	o	1	i think it should go with uh
NWF112	3I	o	1	the siding 
NWF112	3I	c	1	outdoors
NWF112	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF112	3I	o	2	let's do a different one
NWF112	3I	a	1	okay
NWF112	3I	o	1	outdoors
NWF112	3I	c	1	outdoors
NWF112	3I	o	1	with outdoors
NWF112	3I	s	1	with outdoors
NWF112	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF112	3I	c	0	we don't have any
NWF112	3I	d	1	yeah i don't think so
NWF112	3I	o	1	easy grab what i would say was
NWF112	3I	o	1	food for for the trail
NWF112	3I	c	1	li liters of water would be f food for the trail
NWF112	3I	s	1	where do you think
NWF112	3I	o	1	we could put it right up uh right afterwards
NWF112	3I	t	2	we knew this to begin with
NWF111	6B	c	1	okay so if we ta a we have to cut equal numbers from each one so
NWF111	6B	o	1	football equipment
NWF111	6B	o	1	acting coaches
NWF111	6B	d	2	i think we might need those
NWF111	6B	a	1	sugar free
NWF111	6B	o	1	i we had talked about cutting the classes 
NWF111	6B	c	1	i we had talked about cutting the classes 
NWF111	6B	r	1	and i don't know whether we wanna stick with that idea or not
NWF111	6B	c	1	so if we if we cut sex ed here
NWF111	6B	o	1	football equipment
NWF111	6B	s	1	football equipment
NWF111	6B	o	1	acting coaches
NWF111	6B	o	1	um and sugar free machines that's four
NWF111	6B	o	1	so let's see if four ends up being a good number for all of them
NWF111	6B	o	2	keeping reproductive education
NWF111	6B	r	2	are we cancelling it
NWF111	6B	r	2	well yeah but 
NWF111	6B	d	2	w i'm not sure we can
NWF111	6B	c	2	w i'm not sure we can
NWF111	6B	c	1	do we get to plan that have to
NWF111	6B	a	2	maybe that's our thinking maybe that's our thinking
NWF111	6B	t	2	maybe that's our thinking maybe that's our thinking
NWF111	6B	a	1	okay
NWF111	6B	a	2	okay so there's one 
NWF111	6B	o	2	and reproductive education we're keeping 
NWF111	6B	s	2	let's see which one did we decide 
NWF111	6B	c	2	so if we're cutting s t d education
NWF111	6B	o	2	yeah can we get rid of four things 
NWF111	6B	s	2	yeah can we get rid of four things 
NWF111	6B	o	2	oh hospital additions we were gonna cut
NWF111	6B	o	1	can we get rid of weed control
NWF111	6B	s	1	can we get rid of weed control
NWF111	6B	a	1	then we can get rid of weed control 
NWF111	6B	o	1	so we need one more if we're gonna do four
NWF111	6B	c	1	so we need one more if we're gonna do four
NWF111	6B	a	1	yeah you could certainly be
NWF111	6B	o	1	uh we figured we should keep all that
NWF111	6B	c	1	uh we figured we should keep all that
NWF111	6B	o	1	well maybe three maybe we only end up being able to cut three
NWF111	6B	o	1	reusable bag campaign
NWF111	6B	s	1	reusable bag campaign
NWF111	6B	a	1	well okay
NWF111	6B	r	2	so that boy i really hate cutting that the
NWF111	6B	o	2	effort to support people i by providing the food bank i just
NWF111	6B	r	2	effort to support people i by providing the food bank i just
NWF111	6B	o	2	food bank or soup kitchen
NWF111	6B	o	2	one of those two things i think the county should keep
NWF111	6B	c	1	cuz we've got housing assistance 
NWF111	6B	s	1	so which is more valuable 
NWF111	6B	c	1	the soup kitchens are sorta for the homeless people more so and the food bank is more for people who have a place to cook
NWF111	6B	o	2	so maybe the soup kitchen is more of a county function 
NWF111	6B	c	2	cuz there's public health involved with that whereas with the food bank you're handing out packaged things
NWF111	6B	o	1	so maybe we can let a non profit take over the food bank
NWF111	6B	o	1	keep the f keep the soup kitchen
NWF111	6B	o	1	but get rid of 
NWF111	6B	s	1	which one did you suggest the public news station
NWF111	6B	o	1	um did we also say the adoptions
NWF111	6B	s	1	um did we also say the adoptions
NWF111	6B	a	0	outsourcing that
NWF111	6B	a	0	okay
NWF111	6B	a	0	dog catcher 
NWF111	6B	o	0	so there's three things right there
NWF111	6B	o	2	pest control we need veterinary hospital i suppose we need
NWF111	6B	o	1	so the reusable bag campaign
NWF111	6B	c	1	i mean that is good for the environmental issues that it brings up 
NWF111	6B	o	1	okay so we've got
NWF111	6B	o	0	three three for that
NWF111	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWF111	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWF111	6B	a	1	and the taxi stops
NWF111	6B	c	2	so there's three in each category except this we had four 
NWF111	6B	o	2	so we can add one back in
NWF111	6B	o	1	we could ei keep the sugar free juice machines
NWF111	6B	t	1	we could ei keep the sugar free juice machines
NWF111	6B	d	2	w yeah we okay so we we didn't make that choice
NWF111	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWF111	6B	o	2	football equipment does the county need to provide that
NWF111	6B	c	2	football equipment does the county need to provide that
NWF111	6B	s	2	football equipment does the county need to provide that
NWF111	6B	o	2	not so sure 
NWF111	6B	c	2	it's also
NWF111	6B	c	1	well that could also be girls and boys whereas this is football's just boys
NWF111	6B	o	1	so sex ed football equipment
NWF111	6B	o	1	mm the acting coaches we thought were maybe optional
NWF111	6B	o	1	and the sugar free juice machines 
NWF111	6B	c	1	we keep that for for their health purposes 
NWF111	6B	o	1	and get rid of the acting coaches
NWF111	6B	t	1	you like coke do you
NWF111	6B	s	1	so should we knock that one out 
NWF111	6B	o	1	so should we knock that one out 
NWF111	6B	c	1	that's not a county cost anyway
NWF111	6B	o	2	so then we keep the coach
NWF111	6B	o	1	the acting coach
NWF111	6B	o	1	i think we we made our decision about it
NWF111	6B	d	2	no they just said we had to do the same number
NWF111	6B	o	1	maybe we're supposed to discuss each item 
NWF111	6B	c	1	we didn't discuss each item in absolute detail like we did over there i mean you know there were things
NWF111	6B	c	1	like the neighborhood watch support we thought was valuable for
NWF111	6B	c	0	everything 
NWF111	6B	o	0	pre natal checkups is something you know for public health
NWF111	6B	o	1	uh regulations we need that
NWF111	6B	c	1	we have to support the veterans
NWF111	6B	c	2	needle exchange really important for public health and the inspections are important
NWF111	6B	a	1	right
NWF111	6B	a	1	right 
NWF111	6B	c	1	toxic waste disposal's really important
NWF111	6B	c	1	we decided s t d education could be grouped in with reproductive education 
NWF111	6B	s	1	right
NWF111	6B	o	1	uh we're gonna keep the invasive species removal and the vaccinations job training programs and reproductive education
NWF111	6B	a	2	keep the standards high 
NWF111	6B	o	2	subway of course hunting tags are important towing services are important
NWF111	6B	o	2	flagpole repair not so important taxi stops not so important
NWF111	6B	o	2	fishing licenses keeping the buses up and keeping the drainage ditches in good repair that all seems very
NWF111	6B	o	2	important
NWF111	6B	a	1	yep
NWF111	6B	c	1	that's the only thing there is for disability so
NWF111	6B	c	1	in the whole list 
NWF111	6B	o	1	so definitely need to
NWF111	6B	o	1	serve their needs
NWF111	6B	o	2	well good
NWF111	6B	o	2	i think we've got a plan
NWF111	6B	o	1	maybe we weren't clear enou were we clear enough
NWF111	6B	s	1	maybe we weren't clear enou were we clear enough
NWF112	6B	o	2	so we need to keep math tutors assistant cook
NWF112	6B	o	2	sex ed
NWF112	6B	a	1	okay
NWF112	6B	o	1	so we count sex ed
NWF112	6B	a	1	two
NWF112	6B	a	1	three
NWF112	6B	o	1	poetry books in the library
NWF112	6B	s	1	poetry books in the library

NWF112	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWF112	6B	a	1	okay
NWF112	6B	b	1	okay
NWF112	6B	o	2	and cancelling s s t d education
NWF112	6B	c	2	those three went to one
NWF112	6B	c	2	it's in my book we ca
NWF112	6B	t	2	it's in my book we ca
NWF112	6B	c	2	my book we can
NWF112	6B	t	2	my book we can
NWF112	6B	o	1	we're not expanding at the moment
NWF112	6B	c	1	we're not expanding at the moment
NWF112	6B	a	1	okay
NWF112	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF112	6B	c	2	if we keep invasive species removal we keep that we can get rid of weed control
NWF112	6B	o	2	if we keep invasive species removal we keep that we can get rid of weed control
NWF112	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF112	6B	c	1	cuz weed control can go under invasive invasive s species
NWF112	6B	a	1	put up there yeah
NWF112	6B	a	1	yeah that was w under okay
NWF112	6B	a	1	okay
NWF112	6B	o	1	so we're gonna keep the k

NWM070	3I	o	2	those'll go great with uh travel guides in like the literature section maybe there 
NWM070	3I	c	2	those'll go great with uh travel guides in like the literature section maybe there 
NWM070	3I	o	2	up above the loose leaf paper
NWM070	3I	a	1	kay 
NWM070	3I	o	1	those are
NWM070	3I	o	2	those are probably good miscellaneous stuff 
NWM070	3I	c	2	cause we already used up the boating area 
NWM070	3I	o	2	so those'll be right above mouse traps and paper bags
NWM070	3I	a	1	sounds good
NWM070	3I	a	1	very nice 
NWM070	3I	o	1	let's put those
NWM070	3I	o	1	near the cake mix and the butter
NWM070	3I	o	1	on the right side of the store
NWM070	3I	o	1	and looks like our
NWM070	3I	t	2	ooh yeah 
NWM070	3I	a	2	ooh yeah 
NWM070	3I	a	2	oh yeah
NWM070	3I	a	1	yep
NWF115	6B	o	2	let's just go left to right
NWF115	6B	o	1	math tutors are pretty important
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF115	6B	o	2	we're not going to cut sex ed 
NWF115	6B	c	2	that is a bad idea
NWF115	6B	o	2	let's not cut the custodians either
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF115	6B	c	2	and if they have if they're using sub par equipment that could be a public health risk
NWF115	6B	o	2	i don't know how necessary the coaches are in education 
NWF115	6B	c	2	i don't know how necessary the coaches are in education 
NWF115	6B	c	2	because drama teachers usually
NWF115	6B	c	2	are not acting coaches
NWF115	6B	o	1	i'd say let's cut funding for the acting coaches 
NWF115	6B	o	1	just for a little bit and see how things do see if there's a complete fallout of society
NWF115	6B	c	1	just for a little bit and see how things do see if there's a complete fallout of society
NWF115	6B	o	2	we don't need to continue funding poetry books 
NWF115	6B	c	2	because they have poetry books
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah let's keep the special ed and get rid of speech therapy
NWF115	6B	x	2	uh 
NWF115	6B	o	2	just turn on food network
NWF115	6B	c	2	just turn on food network
NWF115	6B	a	2	that is pretty different
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF115	6B	c	1	it's pretty necessary for access
NWF115	6B	x	1	eh
NWF115	6B	o	2	let's go ahead and axe those no more sugar free juice machines
NWF115	6B	o	1	we could lump that in together with the math tutors and keep one or the other
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	c	2	i know so many music teachers 
NWF115	6B	o	2	i don't wanna
NWF115	6B	o	2	and it's important
NWF115	6B	o	1	we'll see
NWF115	6B	o	2	reproductive education that's staying
NWF115	6B	o	1	i guess they're kinda similar
NWF115	6B	c	2	well the sex ed is under education while the reproductive education is under public health
NWF115	6B	c	2	and that could be also be more along the lines of like prenatal
NWF115	6B	c	1	k or not necessarily prenatal checkups which was on there but just
NWF115	6B	c	1	okay yes this is what you need to be doing for your baby's health and all that 
NWF115	6B	o	1	so
NWF115	6B	c	2	definitely don't want an unemployed populous 
NWF115	6B	o	2	so
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	d	2	but i don't think we're necessarily cutting these things forever until the end of time 
NWF115	6B	c	2	but i don't think we're necessarily cutting these things forever until the end of time 
NWF115	6B	o	2	we could probably do a trial cut for
NWF115	6B	a	1	it is important
NWF115	6B	o	2	i don't think we can cross the streams no
NWF115	6B	t	2	i'm so glad you got that reference
NWF115	6B	o	2	we don't want to be wallowing in our own toxic waste
NWF115	6B	c	2	we don't want to be wallowing in our own toxic waste
NWF115	6B	c	2	i know that mine really needs a new operating suite
NWF115	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF115	6B	c	2	who cares about the bagel factories
NWF115	6B	t	2	who cares about the bagel factories
NWF115	6B	a	2	bagel factory inspections they can go off for a little while 
NWF115	6B	o	2	bagel factory inspections they can go off for a little while 
NWF115	6B	f	2	ehm
NWF115	6B	c	2	they don't need public funding really 
NWF115	6B	c	2	so we don't really need do public funding for hospital additions 
NWF115	6B	o	2	so we don't really need do public funding for hospital additions 
NWF115	6B	o	2	so we can cut that
NWF115	6B	o	2	probably not 
NWF115	6B	c	2	because i know that needle exchange also includes uh diabetes equipment for homeless and so on and so forth
NWF115	6B	c	1	moon of 
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	a	2	yeah it's broken 
NWF115	6B	o	2	we need to come up with something else for it
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	o	2	keep it
NWF115	6B	c	2	they're pretty well regulated at this point
NWF115	6B	o	2	so we can cut that
NWF115	6B	o	2	let's get rid of weed control 
NWF115	6B	c	2	invasive species removal is more overarching
NWF115	6B	o	1	totally 
NWF115	6B	f	1	well
NWF115	6B	c	2	i mean the prenatal check ups are pretty important
NWF115	6B	o	2	that would be unpleasant to the microphone
NWF115	6B	t	2	that would be unpleasant to the microphone
NWF115	6B	x	1	let's see
NWF115	6B	f	2	uh gosh
NWF115	6B	c	2	if we were to cut one then the duties that its cut will fall under the other
NWF115	6B	o	2	if we were to cut one then the duties that its cut will fall under the other
NWF115	6B	c	0	prenatal checkups are a larger
NWF115	6B	c	2	financial thing 
NWF115	6B	o	2	so we we should probably keep that
NWF115	6B	c	2	the funding from e reproductive education that isn't completely cut will be funneled into that
NWF115	6B	o	2	there's like no funding that really needs to go to that
NWF115	6B	c	2	there's like no funding that really needs to go to that
NWF115	6B	a	2	and for the most part people don't know their neighbors anymore anyway
NWF115	6B	c	2	and for the most part people don't know their neighbors anymore anyway
NWF115	6B	e	2	yay
NWF115	6B	a	1	we can keep one
NWF115	6B	o	2	then let's keep the reproductive education
NWF115	6B	e	2	excellent
NWF115	6B	o	2	i don't wanna have a whole bunch of cats
NWF115	6B	c	2	i don't wanna have a whole bunch of cats
NWF115	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWF115	6B	a	2	and then it cost money it cost more money to put em down than to spay them
NWF115	6B	c	2	and then it cost money it cost more money to put em down than to spay them
NWF115	6B	o	2	public news station is important
NWF115	6B	c	2	nobody watches it
NWF115	6B	o	2	nobody watches it
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	o	2	we can come back to it
NWF115	6B	o	2	food bank we're keeping
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	c	2	i mean the y m c a has their own 
NWF115	6B	o	2	we don't need a county one
NWF115	6B	o	2	i don't know why we have to have that publicly funded
NWF115	6B	a	1	yes and no more kitten and puppy adoption
NWF115	6B	o	2	let's keep the soup kitchens
NWF115	6B	o	1	let's keep the housing assistance
NWF115	6B	c	2	mm we're not really doing anything with them just catching em and putting em in pound
NWF115	6B	o	2	seems rather ridiculous
NWF115	6B	o	2	i'd say we get rid of the dog catcher
NWF115	6B	a	1	or lump it under pest control there we go
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah no more boys basketball club
NWF115	6B	o	1	we can 
NWF115	6B	f	1	we kind of
NWF115	6B	o	1	combine that with the public news station
NWF115	6B	o	2	so we can get rid of one or the other
NWF115	6B	o	2	do we really need to campaign over it anymore
NWF115	6B	c	2	do we really need to campaign over it anymore
NWF115	6B	s	2	do we really need to campaign over it anymore
NWF115	6B	o	2	people are doing well 
NWF115	6B	c	2	people are doing well 
NWF115	6B	c	2	and for the most part their keeping their plastic bags anyway
NWF115	6B	c	2	i'm gonna assume that we're in the perfect society that has now adopted the reusable bag campaign
NWF115	6B	o	2	and we don't need to campaign over it anymore
NWF115	6B	a	2	i'd like to keep it 
NWF115	6B	d	2	but at the same time 
NWF115	6B	c	2	publicly funded
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	a	2	yeah
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	o	2	so we can keep the
NWF115	6B	o	2	no let's keep the veterinary hospital
NWF115	6B	a	1	nn yeah
NWF115	6B	o	1	let's go ahead and keep the adoption
NWF115	6B	c	2	because i really don't care about that football stadium
NWF115	6B	o	2	because i really don't care about that football stadium
NWF115	6B	o	2	it's not bringing in any money
NWF115	6B	a	1	exactly
NWF115	6B	o	2	oh god keep the teaching certificates
NWF115	6B	a	2	everyone speeds anyway 
NWF115	6B	a	2	and don't we already have them up there 
NWF115	6B	c	2	and don't we already have them up there 
NWF115	6B	c	2	are they pai do we have to pay rent for having them
NWF115	6B	c	2	i mean people aren't stealing them are they
NWF115	6B	o	2	so we'll get rid of the speed limit signs
NWF115	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF115	6B	o	2	let's get rid of the additional bus stops
NWF115	6B	a	2	let's get rid of the additional bus stops
NWF115	6B	a	2	yeah let's keep licensing them
NWF115	6B	a	2	yeah we'll keep the licenses 
NWF115	6B	o	2	so we'll also keep the boating license
NWF115	6B	a	2	yes 
NWF115	6B	o	2	pothole maintenance is necessary
NWF115	6B	r	2	kind of 
NWF115	6B	o	2	it's a subway for like a mile and a half
NWF115	6B	a	0	yeah that's true
NWF115	6B	a	2	yeah we need to keep funding it until it's done 
NWF115	6B	c	2	because a half done one isn't gonna do anything
NWF115	6B	o	2	so we'll keep the subway system for now
NWF115	6B	a	2	so we'll keep the subway system for now
NWF115	6B	c	2	i mean every time someone gets a license they are paying for it
NWF115	6B	c	2	so that's a source of income 
NWF115	6B	o	2	so let's keep that
NWF115	6B	o	2	towing services should be privatized
NWF115	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF115	6B	o	2	so no more towing services
NWF115	6B	o	1	that's another certification
NWF115	6B	t	3	how many flag poles
NWF115	6B	c	3	how many flag poles
NWF115	6B	o	3	how many flag poles
NWF115	6B	s	3	how many flag poles

NWF115	6B	c	3	do we have in this city that we need to have a flag pole repair department
NWF115	6B	o	3	do we have in this city that we need to have a flag pole repair department
NWF115	6B	s	3	do we have in this city that we need to have a flag pole repair department
NWF115	6B	t	3	how many people are we putting out of a job if we cut that 
NWF115	6B	c	3	how many people are we putting out of a job if we cut that 
NWF115	6B	s	3	how many people are we putting out of a job if we cut that 
NWF115	6B	o	3	how many people are we putting out of a job if we cut that 
NWF115	6B	t	3	like one 
NWF115	6B	t	3	name is larry and he works part time 
NWF115	6B	o	3	i think w it's okay if we get rid of the flag pole repair
NWF115	6B	a	2	i have never heard of a taxi stop
NWF115	6B	c	2	i have never heard of a taxi stop
NWF115	6B	c	2	i'm standing outside the grocery store i'm gonna call a taxi
NWF115	6B	o	3	let's get rid of the taxi stops
NWF115	6B	o	3	or at least stop funding them
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	a	1	yes
NWF115	6B	a	2	yes and no more taxi stops
NWF115	6B	a	1	go ahead and keep that
NWF115	6B	o	1	yes we'll keep public bus upkeep
NWF115	6B	a	2	yes they are 
NWF115	6B	o	2	we did not c cut a whole lot here
NWF115	6B	o	1	need one more
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	a	2	there isn't much hunting in the count this particular county
NWF115	6B	c	2	there isn't much hunting in the count this particular county
NWF115	6B	a	2	okay 
NWF115	6B	o	2	well let's get rid of hunting tags
NWF115	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF115	6B	t	1	sorry larry
NWF115	6B	t	1	but you can start your own private business repairing flag poles
NWF115	6B	o	1	we're done
NWF115	6B	t	2	flag pole repair i mean really
NWM070	6B	s	1	which category do you wanna start at
NWM070	6B	a	1	sounds good 
NWM070	6B	s	1	how important are those
NWM070	6B	a	1	i agree 
NWM070	6B	r	1	um they
NWM070	6B	o	1	um they
NWM070	6B	r	1	there may 
NWM070	6B	r	1	uh yeah they're they're important 
NWM070	6B	a	1	uh yeah they're they're important 
NWM070	6B	c	1	it depends on like what kind of math obviously 
NWM070	6B	r	1	it depends on like what kind of math obviously 
NWM070	6B	c	1	but if if if i think it's like everyday stuff like um
NWM070	6B	c	1	important things like taxes or uh stuff like 
NWM070	6B	o	1	that then math math tutors can be very very handy
NWM070	6B	c	1	we already have normal cooks 
NWM070	6B	o	1	we already have normal cooks 
NWM070	6B	s	1	don't we
NWM070	6B	o	1	um so the assistant cooks 
NWM070	6B	f	1	maybe cut those guys
NWM070	6B	o	1	maybe cut those guys
NWM070	6B	a	2	no no 
NWM070	6B	a	2	dear god no 
NWM070	6B	t	2	dear god no 
NWM070	6B	a	2	no 
NWM070	6B	c	2	that a 
NWM070	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM070	6B	c	2	that is needed everybody
NWM070	6B	a	1	custo yeah 
NWM070	6B	c	1	gotta keep stuff clean
NWM070	6B	o	1	i really like it and it's a good idea 
NWM070	6B	f	1	um let's see what else we have uh before we do that
NWM070	6B	o	1	um let's see what else we have uh before we do that
NWM070	6B	o	1	they could deal with a little less
NWM070	6B	c	1	they could deal with a little less
NWM070	6B	f	1	maybe 
NWM070	6B	o	1	i'm not a big fan personally 
NWM070	6B	c	1	but i can't let like personal opinions gets in the way
NWM070	6B	o	1	but i can't let like personal opinions gets in the way
NWM070	6B	a	1	true that's very true
NWM070	6B	b	0	yeah
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM070	6B	f	1	maybe 
NWM070	6B	o	1	cut
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah see see how things go 
NWM070	6B	o	1	maybe next year we can vote on it
NWM070	6B	a	1	sounds good 
NWM070	6B	s	1	poetry books
NWM070	6B	a	1	i don't think so 
NWM070	6B	c	1	there's there's enough
NWM070	6B	c	1	there's enough 
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM070	6B	o	2	speech therapy could fall under that so we could keep the special ed teachers and get rid of speech therapy
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah yeah 
NWM070	6B	c	1	not not too bad
NWM070	6B	o	2	um those co maybe fall under special ed teachers
NWM070	6B	f	2	um those co maybe fall under special ed teachers
NWM070	6B	s	2	um those co maybe fall under special ed teachers
NWM070	6B	d	1	um although it's it's pretty different
NWM070	6B	c	1	um although it's it's pretty different
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM070	6B	c	2	it's pretty necessary for those people
NWM070	6B	o	1	eh it's i i don't care 
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM070	6B	o	1	eh i don't 
NWM070	6B	o	1	think we need to keep funding that
NWM070	6B	c	1	it's not
NWM070	6B	c	1	too hard to learn
NWM070	6B	f	1	maybe i dunno
NWM070	6B	a	1	true true 
NWM070	6B	o	1	let's keep math tutors
NWM070	6B	o	1	i think that's a little better
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM070	6B	t	1	i know
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM070	6B	o	1	i think we can keep that
NWM070	6B	o	2	it could fall under sex ed
NWM070	6B	s	2	it could fall under sex ed
NWM070	6B	f	0	or
NWM070	6B	c	2	cause i mean they're pretty similar
NWM070	6B	o	2	sex ed could
NWM070	6B	a	1	true
NWM070	6B	a	1	true
NWM070	6B	a	1	true yeah yeah
NWM070	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah yeah that that yeah that should work for that
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM070	6B	o	2	so i think keep that keep the vaccinations
NWM070	6B	o	2	not as important it's still it's still a big issue
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM070	6B	c	1	these are all the drastic trial cuts 
NWM070	6B	o	1	these are all the drastic trial cuts 
NWM070	6B	a	1	alright
NWM070	6B	o	2	i i think it's important
NWM070	6B	f	1	um it could
NWM070	6B	o	1	um it could
NWM070	6B	f	1	uh i 
NWM070	6B	o	1	dunno if we can like cross things between categories
NWM070	6B	a	1	okay
NWM070	6B	o	1	yeah it's
NWM070	6B	a	1	no no
NWM070	6B	c	2	we already are over at hanford
NWM070	6B	t	2	pfft this is tough
NWM070	6B	o	2	they're already pretty good
NWM070	6B	a	1	true
NWM070	6B	o	2	could screw bagel
NWM070	6B	t	2	could screw bagel
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM070	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWM070	6B	s	1	do you think needle exchange could fall under s t d education potentially
NWM070	6B	o	1	do you think needle exchange could fall under s t d education potentially
NWM070	6B	f	1	i'm not sure about that one
NWM070	6B	c	1	makes sense
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM070	6B	o	2	i think personally it's pretty broken 
NWM070	6B	c	2	because people who just like drunkenly pee in public or moon somebody they get put on there ruined for the rest of their lives 
NWM070	6B	o	2	i think it's pretty broken
NWM070	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM070	6B	o	2	so cut that for now come up with something else later
NWM070	6B	a	2	keep it yep yep yep
NWM070	6B	o	0	eh
NWM070	6B	a	1	they are 
NWM070	6B	c	1	they're good enough
NWM070	6B	c	2	they're pretty much
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM070	6B	c	2	it's a little more important 
NWM070	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM070	6B	o	2	prenatal checkups could fall un 
NWM070	6B	f	2	fall under reproductive education 
NWM070	6B	s	2	fall under reproductive education 
NWM070	6B	o	2	fall under reproductive education 
NWM070	6B	c	2	cuz like you 
NWM070	6B	f	2	er
NWM070	6B	s	1	which one were you talking about for that
NWM070	6B	a	2	oh yeah 
NWM070	6B	c	2	they're definitely important
NWM070	6B	a	2	oh yeah
NWM070	6B	t	2	oh yeah
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah

NWM070	6B	c	2	it's stupid it's unnecessary
NWM070	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM070	6B	c	1	i mean ther they're
NWM070	6B	c	3	they're getting run out by like all these ride share programs anyway 
NWM070	6B	o	3	which are so much better

NWF116	6B	c	1	or we could be more
NWF116	6B	o	1	appropriate 
NWF116	6B	c	1	appropriate 
NWF116	6B	o	1	and look through and see

NWF116	6B	o	2	and unfortunately invasive species removal
NWF116	6B	f	1	i would think
NWF116	6B	a	2	that's true 
NWF116	6B	o	2	or they could focus on those
NWF116	6B	o	0	those invasive weeds
NWF116	6B	a	2	know

NWF116	6B	f	2	well i'm sorry 
NWF116	6B	o	2	but i would go to invasive species next

NWF116	6B	r	2	but then i'm concerned about the egg farm regulations 
NWF116	6B	o	2	but then i'm concerned about the egg farm regulations 
NWF116	6B	c	2	because of so many people eat eggs 
NWF116	6B	c	2	and if we're talking about salmonella and stuff
NWF116	6B	o	2	and if we're talking about salmonella and stuff

NWF116	6B	o	1	could that be the second from the bottom or 
NWF116	6B	s	1	could that be the second from the bottom or 
NWF116	6B	s	1	were you thinking something else
NWF116	6B	o	2	football stadium upkeep
NWF116	6B	t	2	scary
NWF116	6B	o	2	i don't think we need that
NWF116	6B	a	1	okay
NWF116	6B	o	1	and there's national
NWF116	6B	o	0	stations 
NWF116	6B	d	0	but that then again that would be like that's like getting rid of k u o w 
NWF116	6B	c	0	but that then again that would be like that's like getting rid of k u o w 
NWF116	6B	o	0	but that then again that would be like that's like getting rid of k u o w 
NWF116	6B	s	0	right 
NWF116	6B	a	0	yeah
NWF116	6B	b	0	yeah
NWF116	6B	d	2	oh not puppies though
NWF116	6B	c	2	oh not puppies though
NWF116	6B	a	1	but yeah the
NWF116	6B	a	2	and it doesn't actually 
NWF116	6B	c	2	because people are so
NWF116	6B	c	2	irresponsible with their animals 
NWF116	6B	c	2	or they
NWF116	6B	c	2	especially on your side of the mountains
NWF116	6B	t	2	especially on your side of the mountains
NWF116	6B	c	2	i ain't gonna do that to my dog
NWF116	6B	t	2	i ain't gonna do that to my dog
NWF116	6B	a	1	food bank is important

NWF116	6B	a	2	yep 
NWF116	6B	o	2	then there's boy's basketball club but that's just boys 
NWF116	6B	c	2	junior soccer league is for both
NWF116	6B	o	2	junior soccer league is for both
NWF116	6B	o	1	i would think
NWF116	6B	o	2	i mean it sound there's this theme here 
NWF116	6B	c	2	i mean of i mean you've got stray cat spaying kitten and puppy adoption dog catcher and veterinary hospital 
NWF116	6B	c	2	and it's like whoa are they having a serious issue with or they just want to like
NWF116	6B	o	2	and it's like whoa are they having a serious issue with or they just want to like
NWF116	6B	o	2	so let's just let's just hypothesize that there's a fine
NWF116	6B	o	2	animal hospital and so i would say let's not expand 
NWF116	6B	c	2	i mean that and that's a huge chuck of change uh capital 
NWF116	6B	a	2	yeah
NWF116	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF116	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF116	6B	r	2	well almost
NWF116	6B	d	2	well almost
NWF116	6B	c	3	i'm a i'm a major animal advocate 
NWF116	6B	o	3	so i'm not so sure about that 
NWF116	6B	d	3	so i'm not so sure about that 
NWF116	6B	a	3	yes 
NWF116	6B	a	3	when it comes down to this
NWF116	6B	c	3	when it comes down to this
NWF116	6B	o	1	and dog catcher 
NWF116	6B	s	1	and dog catcher 
NWF116	6B	f	1	maybe
NWF116	6B	s	1	maybe
NWF116	6B	o	1	i mean i guess 
NWF116	6B	f	1	i mean i guess 
NWF116	6B	c	1	if we have to between stray cat spaying and kitten and puppy adoption
NWF116	6B	x	2	oi
NWF116	6B	i	2	oi
NWF116	6B	f	2	i guess 
NWF116	6B	o	2	let's we could 
NWF116	6B	f	2	i mean 
NWF116	6B	o	2	that we could cut the kitten and puppy adoption 
NWF116	6B	c	2	i to me i would think that would be
NWF116	6B	c	2	if you're like trying to do a campaign
NWF116	6B	c	2	have them be adopted
NWF116	6B	o	2	i think stray cat spaying's more important
NWF116	6B	o	1	to keep the number of
NWF116	6B	f	2	i guess to me on the you know on maslow's hierarchy 
NWF116	6B	c	2	i guess to me on the you know on maslow's hierarchy 
NWF116	6B	o	2	it's sort of like
NWF116	6B	c	2	because we live in this world and we are rich enough to talk about how we don't like plastic bags we can not we can do this 
NWF116	6B	f	2	i um
NWF116	6B	f	2	i mean as much as 
NWF116	6B	c	2	again i'm like you know the total green
NWF116	6B	c	2	wash out my ziploc bags and all that 
NWF116	6B	c	2	if there's something we have to cut
NWF116	6B	o	2	if there's something we have to cut
NWF116	6B	c	2	i mean if we cut pest control that could be really bad for everybody 
NWF116	6B	o	2	i mean if we cut pest control that could be really bad for everybody 
NWF116	6B	a	2	you're right 
NWF116	6B	a	2	i i mean the boy's basketball club the junior soccer league those things are very important for kids
NWF116	6B	c	2	i i mean the boy's basketball club the junior soccer league those things are very important for kids
NWF116	6B	a	2	for public health and safety
NWF116	6B	c	2	for public health and safety
NWF116	6B	x	2	oh boy now this
NWF116	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF116	6B	o	2	subway system 
NWF116	6B	s	2	subway system 
NWF116	6B	f	2	i mean 
NWF116	6B	c	2	it all depends on what it is 
NWF116	6B	r	2	but that's
NWF116	6B	o	2	but that's
NWF116	6B	o	2	i mean to me it's like you just 
NWF116	6B	c	2	i mean these the numbers are so you know flag pole maintenance is probably what twenty thousand and a subway system is eighteen million 
NWF116	6B	f	2	but who knows 
NWF116	6B	o	2	it just that's an totally expensive thing
NWF116	6B	c	2	it just that's an totally expensive thing
NWF116	6B	f	1	i'm not saying keep it or leave it 
NWF116	6B	o	1	it does seems a little on the
NWF116	6B	c	1	it does seems a little on the
NWF116	6B	o	2	sorta frivolous 
NWF116	6B	c	2	sorta frivolous 
NWF116	6B	f	2	but then so does tattoo artist li 
NWF116	6B	d	2	but no it's not
NWF116	6B	o	2	licensing is important 
NWF116	6B	c	2	cuz you don't want
NWF116	6B	c	2	all the tattoo artists not being licensed for obviously healthy reasons and things 
NWF116	6B	x	2	but
NWF116	6B	o	1	they don't have any
NWF116	6B	o	2	flag pole repair is one that's easy
NWF116	6B	b	0	mm
NWF116	6B	d	2	but aren't there private
NWF116	6B	c	2	but aren't there private
NWF116	6B	d	2	like triple a and private companies so
NWF116	6B	c	2	like triple a and private companies so
NWF116	6B	d	2	that do that
NWF116	6B	c	2	that do that
NWF116	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF116	6B	a	1	okay
NWF116	6B	o	2	i think we have enough speed limit signs
NWF116	6B	c	2	i think we have enough speed limit signs
NWF116	6B	a	1	they don't light up and change
NWF116	6B	t	1	they don't light up and change
NWF116	6B	t	1	let's do a happy
NWF116	6B	c	2	minimize the number of hunting tags as as opposed to increase the number 
NWF116	6B	o	2	minimize the number of hunting tags as as opposed to increase the number 
NWF116	6B	o	2	i'm cut it
NWF116	6B	o	2	if it means eliminate you know we're gonna have a little n r a issue i think
NWF116	6B	c	2	if it means eliminate you know we're gonna have a little n r a issue i think
NWF116	6B	o	2	hunting tags outta here
NWF116	6B	f	1	for me
NWF116	6B	a	1	not moose season
NWF116	6B	t	1	not moose season

NWF116	6B	o	2	well what 
NWF116	6B	s	2	well what 
NWF116	6B	f	2	and then just looking at 
NWF116	6B	o	2	and then just looking at 
NWF116	6B	o	2	it's sorta like what are we 
NWF116	6B	s	2	it's sorta like what are we 
NWF116	6B	o	2	is the city in or this department in the business of training mass mas massage therapists to get certific 
NWF116	6B	c	2	is the city in or this department in the business of training mass mas massage therapists to get certific 
NWF116	6B	c	2	cuz it says as opposed to licensing 
NWF116	6B	o	2	but i'm assuming it's licensing or certifying 
NWF116	6B	c	2	but i'm assuming it's licensing or certifying 
NWF116	6B	o	2	so then i i think that's important and keeping the teaching
NWF116	6B	a	1	okay
NWF116	6B	a	1	yeah

NWM071	6B	o	2	yeah the sugar free book 
NWM071	6B	o	2	sugar free juice machines don't really seem like a huge priority here

NWM071	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM071	6B	o	1	i'm not a huge fan of football equipment
NWM071	6B	c	1	i'm not a huge fan of football equipment

NWM071	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM071	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM071	6B	a	1	that'd be a good thing
NWM071	6B	o	1	that'd be a good thing
NWM071	6B	c	0	if they need a
NWM071	6B	c	2	computerized blocking sled 
NWM071	6B	o	2	then i don't think they need that
NWM071	6B	t	2	but it calculates the force vectors automatically
NWM071	6B	o	2	yeah bookkeeping classes probably could go 
NWM071	6B	c	2	i don't think
NWM071	6B	c	2	that's becoming pretty much automated now 
NWM071	6B	s	2	right
NWM071	6B	b	0	mm mm
NWM071	6B	a	1	assistant cooks yeah
NWM071	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM071	6B	d	2	bu
NWM071	6B	o	2	holistically are more important
NWM071	6B	c	2	holistically are more important

NWM071	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWM071	6B	o	2	taxi stops just don't seem like they would make a whole lot of sense

NWM071	6B	c	1	like boating licenses that's a source of income
NWM071	6B	o	1	i would certainly hope that they're licensed

NWF117	6B	a	1	that's up for debate okay we'll put a check next to that one
NWF117	6B	o	1	i think that's pretty important 
NWF117	6B	r	1	but it 
NWF117	6B	x	1	oh
NWF117	6B	o	1	we can't move em to another department 
NWF117	6B	s	1	can we

NWF117	6B	o	2	sexually transmitted disease education gone 
NWF117	6B	c	2	although under public health you know what they do

NWF117	6B	c	0	and they have to say well
NWF117	6B	c	0	to whom may you have spread this disease
NWF117	6B	c	0	then they get a list and they go out and knock on the door say how do you do
NWF117	6B	c	0	it's best you come to the public health department and be tested
NWF117	6B	c	0	and treated
NWF117	6B	o	2	that's not education though
NWF117	6B	o	2	it's public health

NWF118	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWF118	6B	a	1	mm hm

NWF118	6B	a	1	the bus stops
NWF118	6B	a	1	can be fewer and farther between
NWF118	6B	o	2	we can't get rid of the subway system that we don't have we cannot get rid of wish we had one

NWM029	3I	o	2	here i wanna d i wanna do one
NWM029	3I	c	2	i think this would be kind of in the construction area but close to siding
NWM029	3I	o	2	so i'm gonna put it like
NWM029	3I	c	1	small axes and mousetraps both kill things 
NWM029	3I	t	1	small axes and mousetraps both kill things 
NWM029	3I	o	1	how's this is that good
NWM029	3I	s	1	how's this is that good
NWM029	3I	o	1	wh right there okay
NWM029	3I	o	2	and this is our edibles obviously on the right here
NWM029	3I	c	2	well i mean this is like useless crap and this is like useful crap
NWM029	3I	t	2	well i mean this is like useless crap and this is like useful crap
NWM029	3I	o	2	so useful inedible useless inedible
NWM029	3I	t	2	so useful inedible useless inedible
NWM029	3I	a	2	sure 
NWM029	3I	o	2	maybe put it just a little bit closer to toilet paper
NWM029	3I	s	2	maybe put it just a little bit closer to toilet paper
NWM029	3I	a	1	that's fine with me
NWM029	3I	c	1	i'm assuming this is for like
NWM029	3I	c	1	home improvement 
NWM029	3I	s	1	you think
NWM029	3I	c	1	not quite deadly but construction ish
NWM029	3I	t	1	not quite deadly but construction ish
NWM029	3I	a	1	yeah alright
NWM029	3I	c	2	well this is in our 
NWM029	3I	o	2	let's put is across from boating supplies 
NWM029	3I	c	2	because if you fall off the boat
NWM029	3I	t	2	because if you fall off the boat
NWM029	3I	a	2	oh yeah hey how bout that 
NWM029	3I	o	2	s so maybe like traveling stuff maybe fi if we ever find car junk we'll put it over here
NWM029	3I	a	1	y y yeah okay
NWM029	3I	c	2	we don't have anything like this kind of i don't think
NWM029	3I	c	2	alright if we think it's a tiny portable one 
NWM029	3I	o	2	then maybe we want it next to like travel guides 
NWM029	3I	s	2	then maybe we want it next to like travel guides 
NWM029	3I	o	2	but like on the other side so this is like fishing and then camping
NWM029	3I	o	1	or do you want it over here
NWM029	3I	s	1	or do you want it over here
NWM029	3I	o	1	put it over here
NWM029	3I	s	1	put it over here
NWM029	3I	c	2	just in case we find something else fishing 
NWM029	3I	o	2	wanna put it right here
NWM029	3I	s	2	wanna put it right here
NWM029	3I	a	1	outdoors yeah sounds good to me
NWM029	3I	o	2	that's gonna be over here 
NWM029	3I	o	2	but where over here
NWM029	3I	s	2	but where over here
NWM029	3I	c	2	so we've got healthy stuff and unhealthy stuff 
NWM029	3I	o	2	and then the unhealthy stuff mixed together is over here
NWM029	3I	c	1	well you can use oatmeal to like make cookies 
NWM029	3I	o	1	you wanna put this like over 
NWM029	3I	s	1	you wanna put this like over 
NWM029	3I	c	1	cuz that's kind of a r
NWM029	3I	b	2	yeah 
NWM029	3I	o	2	raw materials doesn't matter 
NWM029	3I	c	2	because we see eggs and sugar like in a in different places 
NWM029	3I	o	2	i'm happy with that
NWM029	3I	o	1	useful s 
NWM029	3I	x	1	crap
NWM029	3I	o	2	we agree that it's in this one 
NWM029	3I	s	2	right 
NWM029	3I	o	2	the middle one
NWM029	3I	s	2	the middle one
NWM029	3I	b	2	okay 
NWM029	3I	o	2	so d maybe we could put it next to toys 
NWM029	3I	i	2	so d maybe we could put it next to toys 
NWM029	3I	c	2	i mean those a th they're for entertainment 
NWM029	3I	o	2	so let's do that
NWM029	3I	o	1	that's gonna be over here somewhere 
NWM029	3I	s	1	right
NWM029	3I	o	2	yes 
NWM029	3I	i	2	yes 
NWM029	3I	o	2	put it next to the axes
NWM029	3I	t	2	put it next to the axes
NWM029	3I	c	2	that's traveling stuff 
NWM029	3I	o	2	i'm gonna put it across from the gas powered cookstove 
NWM029	3I	c	2	because
NWM029	3I	c	1	cuz then it's like already on your back n you're looking at cookstoves 
NWM029	3I	f	1	i don't know
NWM029	3I	c	2	so we have like this 
NWM029	3I	f	2	i don't know 
NWM029	3I	o	2	this isn't quite arts and crafts yet
NWM029	3I	o	1	i think i'd put it next to here 
NWM029	3I	c	1	with all our sharp things
NWM029	3I	c	2	sharp and potentially deadly things
NWM029	3I	t	2	sharp and potentially deadly things
NWM029	3I	o	1	across from ice cream obviously 
NWM029	3I	t	1	across from ice cream obviously 
NWM029	3I	f	1	no
NWM029	3I	o	2	no this is in fishing supplies
NWM029	3I	t	2	no this is in fishing supplies
NWM029	3I	o	1	we could put like
NWM029	3I	c	2	our unhealthy stuff is like kind of in this area 
NWM029	3I	o	2	maybe we should just stick it across from the sugar
NWM029	3I	s	2	maybe we should just stick it across from the sugar
NWM029	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM029	3I	a	1	right right true 
NWM029	3I	c	1	like so this is consumable 
NWM029	3I	s	1	but where do we want it 
NWM029	3I	c	1	like how are we ranging this
NWM029	3I	s	1	like how are we ranging this
NWM029	3I	c	2	like soybeans are healthy sugar is not 
NWM029	3I	o	2	so this is like the unhealthy half and this is the healthy half
NWM029	3I	r	2	but s s whiskey's usually like on the end of the aisle 
NWM029	3I	c	2	but s s whiskey's usually like on the end of the aisle 
NWM029	3I	o	2	do we wanna like put it at the end
NWM029	3I	s	2	do we wanna like put it at the end
NWM029	3I	a	1	okay
NWM029	3I	o	1	oh that's gonna be over here somewhere
NWM029	3I	o	2	kind of in the middle maybe
NWM029	3I	s	2	kind of in the middle maybe
NWM029	3I	s	1	what do you think
NWM029	3I	a	1	yeah sure
NWM029	3I	c	1	i'm not really particular about where my bottles of juice go
NWM029	3I	o	1	next to the books 
NWM029	3I	s	1	maybe
NWM029	3I	f	1	maybe
NWM029	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWM029	3I	c	1	books are made of paper
NWM029	3I	t	2	i don't know how people shop
NWM029	3I	o	1	maybe next to the travel guides maybe just like stick them up here
NWM029	3I	c	1	oh are we gonna run into clothes
NWM029	3I	s	1	oh are we gonna run into clothes
NWM029	3I	o	2	maybe we should like reserve this area for clothes
NWM029	3I	s	1	what do you think
NWM029	3I	f	1	i don't know 
NWM029	3I	o	1	they c it could creep into toys
NWM029	3I	o	2	here i'm just gonna stick this like
NWM029	3I	o	1	here ish
NWM029	3I	o	2	and then we can like fill this area with other clothes items if we needed
NWM029	3I	o	2	right here
NWM029	3I	o	2	that goes with boats
NWM029	3I	o	2	it's gonna be bad
NWM029	3I	t	2	it's gonna be bad
NWM029	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWM029	3I	i	2	yeah 
NWM029	3I	e	2	that's a good idea i like that idea 
NWM029	3I	o	2	i'm gonna put that here
NWM029	3I	x	1	uh oh
NWM029	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM029	3I	a	1	sure that's fine
NWM029	3I	c	2	we did the best we could under the circumstances
NWM029	3I	o	2	right across from shoelaces maybe up one 
NWM029	3I	c	2	just in case we find boots to put there
NWM029	3I	o	2	next to our 
NWM029	3I	a	2	yeah next to cord y thingies
NWM029	3I	o	1	i'm happy with that like normally i'd put that near boating supplies but whatever
NWM029	3I	o	2	uh i'd put that in the healthy section next to the soybeans 
NWM029	3I	f	2	maybe 
NWM029	3I	s	2	are we allowed to put them down there
NWM029	3I	a	1	yeah let's try to 
NWM029	3I	o	1	we'll like scope ourselves between the things
NWM029	3I	o	2	next to bottles of juice
NWM029	3I	i	2	next to bottles of juice
NWM029	3I	c	2	that's how i see 
NWM029	3I	t	2	that's how i see 
NWM029	3I	c	2	that's how i see stores
NWM029	3I	t	2	that's how i see stores
NWM029	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWM029	3I	o	1	maybe put them next to the boots the fleece lined boots 
NWM029	3I	c	1	because we're getting into like
NWM029	3I	c	1	this is like the warm stuff
NWM029	3I	c	1	like if you're going ou this is the outdoors and then
NWM029	3I	a	2	yeah it would 
NWM029	3I	o	2	maybe we just put it next to here 
NWM029	3I	c	2	as close to the stove as we could
NWM029	3I	o	1	down here probably 
NWM029	3I	c	1	this is like toiletries
NWM029	3I	c	1	just in case 
NWM029	3I	a	1	alright sounds good to me
NWM029	3I	o	2	just snap that next to the face cream
NWM029	3I	c	2	maybe we're kinda going in to kitchen stuff here like with this
NWM029	3I	o	1	do you wanna just start yo doing that here
NWM029	3I	s	1	do you wanna just start yo doing that here
NWM029	3I	c	2	but we do have refrigerator magnets here 
NWM029	3I	o	2	we could put it over here
NWM029	3I	d	2	no 
NWM029	3I	c	2	technically you already put it up so you can't move it
NWM029	3I	f	1	it's fine i don't care

NWM029	3I	o	2	i'll put it next to the eggs

NWM065	3I	o	1	this one filled up a lot
NWM065	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM029	6B	o	0	have to cut the same number of items from each column
NWM029	6B	c	0	gotta cut the same number of items so
NWM029	6B	o	2	i think we'll go through a list and be like this is how many useless things we found and then we'll cut that same number
NWM029	6B	o	2	but if it i but the be maybe if we agree that it's too low then we'll switch it up
NWM029	6B	o	1	so let's just think about these things 
NWM029	6B	t	1	sugar free juice machines
NWM029	6B	o	1	i think we can 
NWM029	6B	s	1	th any one that jump out at you
NWM029	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM029	6B	o	2	i think so too 
NWM029	6B	c	2	bring your own juice
NWM029	6B	t	2	bring your own juice
NWM029	6B	o	1	and b i think bookkeeping classes
NWM029	6B	c	2	why would you need an education program for that
NWM029	6B	t	2	why would you need an education program for that
NWM029	6B	o	1	how bout uh assistant cooks
NWM029	6B	s	1	how bout uh assistant cooks
NWM029	6B	c	2	because you already have cooks why do you need assistant cooks the cooks will just have to work a little harder i'm sorry
NWM029	6B	o	1	let's keep k sex ed
NWM029	6B	o	2	let's keep custodians 
NWM029	6B	i	2	let's keep custodians 
NWM029	6B	c	2	they're really important
NWM029	6B	a	2	yeah cut that 
NWM029	6B	c	2	that's not really necessary we got the internet learn on your o learn on your own
NWM029	6B	t	2	that's not really necessary we got the internet learn on your o learn on your own
NWM029	6B	o	2	uh special ed teachers we kinda need 
NWM029	6B	c	2	because that well we'll run into that 
NWM029	6B	o	2	math is important
NWM029	6B	o	2	is pre 
NWM029	6B	r	2	um
NWM029	6B	c	2	so the thing about speech therapy is we would either we would either need them if we cut that we'd need the to do that on their own which is kinda n of
NWM029	6B	c	2	kind of a burden
NWM029	6B	a	2	we could cut 
NWM029	6B	a	2	yeah
NWM029	6B	*	2	yeah
NWM029	6B	r	1	i guess
NWM029	6B	*	1	i guess
NWM029	6B	r	2	that's well i 
NWM029	6B	c	2	mean it's just a program it's like an acting program so we have like the music program we got the math program 
NWM029	6B	d	2	i might wa we maybe we keep the acting one and we cut the poetry books
NWM029	6B	o	2	i might wa we maybe we keep the acting one and we cut the poetry books
NWM029	6B	c	2	because we
NWM029	6B	c	2	get your own boo
NWM029	6B	t	2	get your own boo
NWM029	6B	a	2	go to the library yeah do that
NWM029	6B	t	2	go to the library yeah do that
NWM029	6B	o	1	so how bout we cut five from each of these
NWM029	6B	s	1	so how bout we cut five from each of these
NWM029	6B	o	1	let's just read all of them
NWM029	6B	i	0	bagel factory inspections
NWM029	6B	o	1	things that jump out at me
NWM029	6B	o	2	get rid of the needle exchange
NWM029	6B	c	3	that is i don't know what that is but it seems terrible
NWM029	6B	o	2	let's get rid of the neighborhood watch support
NWM029	6B	c	1	invasive species removal and i think weed control overlap so and i think weed control does less 
NWM029	6B	o	1	and so i think we could get rid of tha 
NWM029	6B	s	1	is that three
NWM029	6B	c	2	and stupid
NWM029	6B	t	2	and stupid
NWM029	6B	o	2	let's get rid of that
NWM029	6B	o	1	i think we're going to k have to keep toxic waste disposal 
NWM029	6B	c	1	that seems important
NWM029	6B	o	1	vaccinations are important job training is important reproductive is important
NWM029	6B	a	2	that's true 
NWM029	6B	o	2	maybe if we cut the s t d education we can just keep reproductive
NWM029	6B	c	2	maybe if we cut the s t d education we can just keep reproductive
NWM029	6B	s	2	maybe if we cut the s t d education we can just keep reproductive
NWM029	6B	a	2	sure 
NWM029	6B	i	2	sure 
NWM029	6B	a	2	let's do 
NWM029	6B	o	2	let's do that
NWM029	6B	t	2	let's do that
NWM029	6B	o	1	i think pre natal checkups is fine i guess
NWM029	6B	a	1	yeah sure we'll keep it in
NWM029	6B	i	0	pest control

NWM029	6B	t	2	what where where are we 
NWM029	6B	c	2	i don i don't see k dog catchers 
NWM029	6B	o	2	we have to worry about that
NWM029	6B	a	1	yeah don't think that's a 
NWM029	6B	c	1	i don't think that's a problem right now
NWM029	6B	o	1	so that's two we can get rid of
NWM029	6B	o	1	how bout public access station
NWM029	6B	s	1	how bout public access station
NWM029	6B	c	3	just cuz there's not a lot of

NWM029	6B	o	2	okay that's five
NWM029	6B	o	2	that's going away
NWM029	6B	o	2	ooh this is gonna be tough
NWM029	6B	o	2	tattoo artist licenses we can get rid of that 
NWM029	6B	c	2	because you can look at the art on their wall or get recommendations or whatever you don't really need a license to do that
NWM029	6B	o	2	i think you freaking need those
NWM029	6B	o	2	uh
NWM029	6B	i	2	uh

NWM029	6B	c	2	but the subway system is like a centralized thing 
NWM029	6B	f	2	i don't know
NWM029	6B	c	2	subway system kinda goes like is the main s stop thing and then you take buses around like the outsides an and junk 
NWM029	6B	o	2	i think you need both of those
NWM029	6B	o	2	all these things are pretty p important 
NWM029	6B	o	2	oh oh oh oh let's get rid of that
NWM029	6B	t	2	oh oh oh oh let's get rid of that
NWM029	6B	o	2	get out

NWM029	6B	o	1	why don't we just get rid of speed limit signs 
NWM029	6B	c	1	no one follows them anyway
NWM029	6B	o	2	you could get rid of towing services

NWM067	3I	t	2	i just think it's really funny 
NWM067	3I	o	2	the only thing is though that uh
NWM047	6B	o	1	that's kinda like being in the government
NWM047	6B	o	1	uh the uh budget subcommittee or whatever
NWM047	6B	c	1	uh the uh budget subcommittee or whatever
NWM047	6B	o	1	so we'd like take two outta here and two outta here and two outta here and two outta here 
NWM047	6B	s	1	so we'd like take two outta here and two outta here and two outta here and two outta here 
NWM047	6B	s	1	or something like that
NWM047	6B	f	2	well math tutors i mean 
NWM047	6B	o	2	we don't need math tutors 
NWM047	6B	c	2	if kids can't add then they're just hopeless
NWM047	6B	o	2	i mean they need to you know what
NWM047	6B	o	2	all they need to do is buy a text book 
NWM047	6B	c	2	and uh if they can't
NWM047	6B	c	2	you know pay attention in class and do their homework and read the text book then it's like
NWM047	6B	c	2	they should just become english majors
NWM047	6B	o	2	well i think they should try it for a while but then if it
NWM047	6B	o	2	if they just flunking out it's like switch to sociology or something
NWM047	6B	a	1	mm kay
NWM047	6B	d	1	seems like a w
NWM047	6B	c	1	seems like a w
NWM047	6B	o	2	seems like a waste of time 
NWM047	6B	c	2	seems like a waste of time 
NWM047	6B	a	2	but alright
NWM047	6B	o	2	oh we hafta have that 
NWM047	6B	c	2	because
NWM047	6B	c	2	well because
NWM047	6B	c	1	because if we're
NWM047	6B	c	1	hiking through the wilderness in canada and we've got twenty miles to go to the next
NWM047	6B	c	1	town we're gonna need somebody to cook for us

NWM047	6B	b	0	yeah
NWM047	6B	b	0	yeah
NWM047	6B	a	2	plus you'd probably disagree with them after a while anyway 
NWM047	6B	c	2	plus you'd probably disagree with them after a while anyway 
NWM047	6B	o	2	it'd be like you know it's like hey i don't like the way you made this i just wanna make it myself
NWM047	6B	c	2	cuz nobody can really
NWM047	6B	a	2	yeah yeah 
NWM047	6B	c	2	it could get dangerous after a while
NWM047	6B	o	2	well that's beyond question 
NWM047	6B	s	2	right
NWM047	6B	o	2	well that never stops 
NWM047	6B	s	2	right 
NWM047	6B	c	2	your whole life 
NWM047	6B	o	2	your whole life 
NWM047	6B	s	2	right 
NWM047	6B	c	2	i mean you
NWM047	6B	c	1	need that when you're in
NWM047	6B	c	1	you need that even more when you're in your seventies
NWM047	6B	a	1	okay
NWM047	6B	f	2	uh well i mean you know 
NWM047	6B	o	2	depends on whether or not it's a union shop
NWM047	6B	c	2	cuz you gonna hafta deal with the
NWM047	6B	c	2	um the stewards
NWM047	6B	c	2	mm they got a pretty powerful lobby 
NWM047	6B	r	2	well
NWM047	6B	o	2	it real what it really comes down to is whether or not this is teamsters
NWM047	6B	c	2	it real what it really comes down to is whether or not this is teamsters
NWM047	6B	a	1	well yeah
NWM047	6B	a	1	yeah yeah yeah yeah
NWM047	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM047	6B	a	1	right yeah yeah 
NWM047	6B	c	1	that's pretty
NWM047	6B	o	2	i've seen the classrooms here 
NWM047	6B	x	2	believe me
NWM047	6B	o	1	we'll hafta come back to that one
NWM047	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM047	6B	e	1	good question 
NWM047	6B	c	1	they don't specify
NWM047	6B	o	2	yeah something could be done with making these a little bit more specific
NWM047	6B	o	2	less ambiguous anyway
NWM047	6B	o	1	so this assumes that we already have a bunch of football equipment and we're gonna throw it away
NWM047	6B	s	1	so this assumes that we already have a bunch of football equipment and we're gonna throw it away
NWM047	6B	o	1	and buy new eq buy new equipment
NWM047	6B	s	1	and buy new eq buy new equipment
NWM047	6B	o	1	or is this a committee to oversee the football equipment
NWM047	6B	s	1	or is this a committee to oversee the football equipment
NWM047	6B	o	2	well see this is
NWM047	6B	o	2	this is a county
NWM047	6B	c	2	this is a county
NWM047	6B	c	2	so that stuff's probably all moldy and
NWM047	6B	c	2	from the seventies you know
NWM047	6B	o	2	it's just gross throw it away
NWM047	6B	o	2	yeah i am saying that
NWM047	6B	c	0	cuz i've
NWM047	6B	c	1	i've used it in um
NWM047	6B	c	1	i uh i actually worked for uh multnomah county for awhile i worked for the uh
NWM047	6B	c	1	well it was for the libraries multnomah county library at the hillsdale library
NWM047	6B	c	1	i worked at the hillsdale library for three months
NWM047	6B	c	1	i i didn't actually play football but i mean i did like p e of course at you know in school 
NWM047	6B	o	1	and and that stuff man that that
NWM047	6B	o	2	it's so you you don't wanna it's so rank
NWM047	6B	o	2	you don't wanna put that stuff on
NWM047	6B	o	2	it was like oh man you wouldn't even wanna put that thing on it was so gross
NWM047	6B	o	2	they never well of course that would be an argument for changing it
NWM047	6B	f	2	i dunno 
NWM047	6B	o	2	i i they could probably cut all that stuff
NWM047	6B	c	2	why 
NWM047	6B	*	2	why 
NWM047	6B	o	2	it it shouldn't be football equipment it should be sports equipment if it was sports equipment i would say yes keep it
NWM047	6B	c	2	but it's just football equipment
NWM047	6B	f	1	i mean you know 
NWM047	6B	c	1	not everybody plays football so
NWM047	6B	o	1	not everybody plays football so
NWM047	6B	o	1	that could bring in big bucks for the the county 
NWM047	6B	c	1	you know cuz they got these football teams they got these like big football stars and whatever and they end up going to the n f l and they get all these contracts and stuff
NWM047	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM047	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM047	6B	o	2	so maybe we should keep it we should keep it
NWM047	6B	a	1	okay i'm with you
NWM047	6B	o	1	you wouldn't wanna get rid of them
NWM047	6B	a	1	exactly yeah yeah right yeah
NWM047	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM047	6B	c	1	like the sandusky guy or whatever you know
NWM047	6B	o	2	could get rid of the retired coaches
NWM047	6B	f	1	you know honestly 
NWM047	6B	c	1	i was not a
NWM047	6B	c	1	big into poetry
NWM047	6B	o	1	but i i shouldn't use that as a basis to i
NWM047	6B	o	1	i'm not supposed to be biased 
NWM047	6B	s	1	right
NWM047	6B	o	2	i'll leave that up to you
NWM047	6B	o	1	e e cummings okay robert frost okay everybody else forget it
NWM047	6B	b	0	yeah
NWM047	6B	o	2	oh yeah you gotta keep them
NWM047	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM047	6B	c	2	cuz
NWM047	6B	f	2	you know 
NWM047	6B	c	2	with our society we're just gonna need more and more of those as time goes on i think
NWM047	6B	c	2	cuz they're creating new categories of special ed all the time
NWM047	6B	c	2	they're subdividing now
NWM047	6B	o	2	it's it's a high need
NWM047	6B	o	2	hey here's the thing it's funny 
NWM047	6B	c	2	because when i i did my um my tesol degree my my m a in tesol here
NWM047	6B	c	1	and uh i ended up taking a course in how to teach writing to well they call it learning disabled now l d s
NWM047	6B	c	2	but it's basically special ed
NWM047	6B	f	2	and um well n i mean 
NWM047	6B	o	2	there is a difference
NWM047	6B	c	1	and they were saying that you know with all the teachers that were being uh
NWM047	6B	c	1	losing their jobs and whatever
NWM047	6B	o	1	that was the category that everybody was trying to become 
NWM047	6B	c	1	that was the category that everybody was trying to become 
NWM047	6B	c	1	because that's where the jobs are
NWM047	6B	o	2	so that's like it's booming business
NWM047	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM047	6B	o	2	that's a huge business now that's a big business
NWM047	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM047	6B	o	2	well it's either that or starve to death 
NWM047	6B	c	2	well it's either that or starve to death 
NWM047	6B	s	2	right 
NWM047	6B	x	2	i mean geez
NWM047	6B	a	2	yeah that's true 
NWM047	6B	c	2	i i never took a cooking class and i'm still alive
NWM047	6B	o	1	just barely
NWM047	6B	o	1	but still
NWM047	6B	r	2	well 
NWM047	6B	o	2	some people gonna need em
NWM047	6B	c	2	some people gonna need em
NWM047	6B	o	2	and the thing is they they have crossover with like second language learners too
NWM047	6B	o	1	well actually at this point now
NWM047	6B	a	1	at this point that's pretty much what it's gonna be 
NWM047	6B	o	1	at this point that's pretty much what it's gonna be 
NWM047	6B	s	1	at this point that's pretty much what it's gonna be 
NWM047	6B	s	1	right
NWM047	6B	o	2	so then it should be under a different category it should be under like uh
NWM047	6B	o	1	i was gonna say technology
NWM047	6B	o	1	i t
NWM047	6B	c	1	because they're the ones that're actually gonna issue the devices 
NWM047	6B	s	1	right
NWM047	6B	o	1	just gonna stick a computer in your hand and say here punch this button click this
NWM047	6B	o	1	it's not gonna be any need for a person
NWM047	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM047	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM047	6B	b	0	yeah
NWM047	6B	r	2	well the bookkeeping i mean
NWM047	6B	o	2	you're kind of a branch of that 
NWM047	6B	c	2	you're kind of a branch of that 
NWM047	6B	s	2	right
NWM047	6B	b	0	yeah
NWM047	6B	a	2	oh yeah yeah right yeah job security okay yeah
NWM047	6B	a	2	get it rid of it
NWM047	6B	a	2	boom
NWM047	6B	t	2	boom
NWM047	6B	t	2	that was gonna go with the whiskey 
NWM047	6B	s	2	right
NWM047	6B	a	1	yeah it is
NWM047	6B	a	2	b s
NWM047	6B	o	2	that's water

NWM047	6B	c	2	they don't need weed control 
NWM047	6B	s	2	do they
NWM047	6B	c	2	see here's the thing
NWM047	6B	o	2	they need to um
NWM047	6B	c	2	they need to um
NWM047	6B	o	2	what they should have in in a school
NWM047	6B	o	2	they should have the high school kids go out and do like
NWM047	6B	f	2	you know 
NWM047	6B	o	2	one
NWM047	6B	o	2	they get one credit for community service

NWM047	6B	c	1	it's like five minutes 
NWM047	6B	s	1	right
NWM047	6B	c	2	how long can it take to spay
NWM047	6B	s	2	how long can it take to spay
NWM047	6B	a	1	well yeah of course yeah
NWM047	6B	d	2	well newspaper would work better for that prolly
NWM047	6B	c	2	well newspaper would work better for that prolly
NWM047	6B	o	2	well newspaper would work better for that prolly
NWM047	6B	f	2	uh well i mean 
NWM047	6B	o	2	people already know about that though 
NWM047	6B	c	2	people already know about that though 
NWM047	6B	s	2	right 
NWM047	6B	o	2	we don't need to campaign for it
NWM047	6B	c	2	people already know that they're sposta bring their bags in a bag with them in to
NWM047	6B	a	2	yeah we wouldn't we wouldn't need a special campaign for that
NWM047	6B	o	2	well you could bring a politician with you and he use his bag
NWM047	6B	t	2	you mean like a bag of wind
NWM047	6B	s	2	you mean like a bag of wind
NWM047	6B	c	1	well if we have the kitten and puppy adoption 
NWM047	6B	o	1	then we hafta have veterinary hospital 
NWM047	6B	s	1	right
NWM047	6B	c	2	cuz they're gonna get sick and then there's gonna be lawsuits
NWM047	6B	d	2	unless for the stray dogs
NWM047	6B	c	2	unless for the stray dogs
NWM047	6B	d	2	or the stray cats
NWM047	6B	o	2	or the stray cats
NWM047	6B	c	2	the stray cats need to be
NWM047	6B	c	2	need to have some place to go 
NWM047	6B	s	2	right
NWM047	6B	o	2	maybe they could do it at the food bank
NWM047	6B	o	2	well as long as they don't label their packages it should be alright
NWM047	6B	o	1	i think we could
NWM047	6B	o	1	combine almost all these
NWM047	6B	o	1	we could combine stray cat spaying dog catcher veterinary hospital
NWM047	6B	o	1	pest control and um the food bank
NWM047	6B	a	0	yeah
NWM047	6B	a	0	yeah
NWM047	6B	a	1	okay okay
NWM047	6B	o	2	well you gotta have teaching certificates 
NWM047	6B	c	2	because that's what i have
NWM047	6B	o	2	i can't help it but i have a biased
NWM047	6B	o	2	a bias
NWM047	6B	o	2	i'm just too biased
NWM047	6B	a	2	that would be fine 
NWM047	6B	c	2	because then um i there would be less competition for me for classes
NWM047	6B	o	2	so if we cut all the cert the teaching certificates then i wouldn't hafta compete with other teachers to get classes every quarter
NWM047	6B	c	2	so if we cut all the cert the teaching certificates then i wouldn't hafta compete with other teachers to get classes every quarter
NWM047	6B	a	2	so yeah 
NWM047	6B	o	2	we can go ahead and cut that
NWM047	6B	c	2	because currently i hafta compete with other teachers to get classes
NWM047	6B	c	2	there'd be fewer teachers certified
NWM047	6B	a	0	yeah
NWM047	6B	a	0	yeah
NWM047	6B	a	1	okay okay
NWM047	6B	o	2	yeah 
NWM047	6B	c	2	because they they change that all the time
NWM047	6B	o	1	no
NWM047	6B	o	0	i d

NWM067	6B	o	1	we must choose the same number

NWM067	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM067	6B	a	1	yeah

NWM067	6B	o	2	not particularly um dynamic
NWM067	6B	f	2	i mean
NWM067	6B	c	2	based on this list 
NWM067	6B	o	2	i
NWM067	6B	o	2	the poor assistant cooks go near the top football equipment goes near the top 
NWM067	6B	f	2	for me 
NWM067	6B	o	2	like meaning get like we would cut it
NWM067	6B	o	1	cooking classes
NWM067	6B	o	1	bookkeeping classes
NWM067	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM067	6B	c	1	there's some accounting involved
NWM067	6B	o	2	so i'd i'd wanna get rid of the classes 
NWM067	6B	c	2	so that it would mean you know more long term like job preservation and people weren't
NWM067	6B	a	2	exactly exactly 
NWM067	6B	o	2	that gets cut first
NWM067	6B	o	2	we need bad accounting
NWM067	6B	t	2	we need bad accounting
NWM067	6B	c	2	that's a little oxymoronic anyway 
NWM067	6B	c	2	i mean what is sugar free juice
NWM067	6B	s	2	i mean what is sugar free juice
NWM067	6B	a	1	pretty much

NWM067	6B	a	1	right
NWM067	6B	o	1	so shall we move to the next category and then we can kinda come back and keep our numbers 
NWM067	6B	s	1	so shall we move to the next category and then we can kinda come back and keep our numbers 
NWM067	6B	a	1	yes
NWM067	6B	a	2	absolutely 
NWM067	6B	o	2	i don't get rid of the water fountains
NWM067	6B	x	1	eh
NWM067	6B	o	1	should probably hang onto that
NWM067	6B	o	1	sure
NWM067	6B	o	1	sounds good
NWM067	6B	o	1	yeah yep
NWM067	6B	x	2	bagel factory inspections
NWM067	6B	o	2	absolutely the most critical role that the county can play is bagel factory inspections
NWM067	6B	x	2	geez 
NWM067	6B	o	2	and none of these things i would really get rid of compared about t five or six on the other one

NWM067	6B	s	2	don't they
NWM067	6B	a	2	mm kay i'm with you on weed control
NWM067	6B	a	1	yeah

NWM067	6B	c	1	what could go wrong
NWM067	6B	s	1	what could go wrong
NWM067	6B	o	2	that's that's what we need we need everybody to be armed
NWM067	6B	a	2	then yeah 
NWM067	6B	o	2	then we don't need any regulation
NWM067	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM067	6B	b	0	right
NWM067	6B	a	2	so yeah i think we could cut the neighborhood watch support 
NWM067	6B	o	2	and instead just give them all pepper spray and weapons and yeah
NWM067	6B	o	1	pick axes
NWM067	6B	o	1	pitch forks torches
NWM067	6B	a	2	yes exact

NWM067	6B	c	2	if we cut the toxic waste disposal program
NWM067	6B	s	2	if we cut the toxic waste disposal program
NWM067	6B	o	2	does that mean that people will dispose of their toxic waste in another county
NWM067	6B	c	2	does that mean that people will dispose of their toxic waste in another county
NWM067	6B	s	2	does that mean that people will dispose of their toxic waste in another county
NWM067	6B	s	2	so why don't 
NWM067	6B	o	2	so why don't 
NWM067	6B	o	2	let's just do that and then they'll take it all to pierce county
NWM067	6B	d	2	wasn't that what you do now

NWM067	6B	x	1	uh
NWM067	6B	o	1	most of the world
NWM067	6B	o	1	greece
NWM067	6B	o	1	thailand slash approach where could just have the dogs and the cats running around doing everything

NWM067	6B	e	2	i think that's a brilliant idea 
NWM067	6B	o	2	what they should do is
NWM067	6B	o	2	they should take m force me to take my lunch hour and just reassign everybody who does all these other public functions to go do dog catching
NWM067	6B	x	1	you know

NWF092	3I	s	0	i wonder if they're talking about kitchen knives or
NWF092	3I	o	0	i wonder if they're talking about kitchen knives or
NWF092	3I	a	0	yeah like a box knife
NWF092	3I	o	0	yeah like a box knife
NWF092	3I	a	1	ye probably you're right it's probably like a box cutter cuz it would be box of knives
NWF092	3I	c	1	ye probably you're right it's probably like a box cutter cuz it would be box of knives
NWF092	3I	s	1	where should we stick it
NWF092	3I	a	1	yeah that sounds like a
NWF092	3I	o	1	that's outdoor 
NWF092	3I	s	1	that's outdoor 
NWF092	3I	f	1	i don't know it's kinda random
NWF092	3I	t	1	i don't know it's kinda random
NWF092	3I	o	2	i say b it's be somewhere over here 
NWF092	3I	a	2	that's where i would put it too
NWF092	3I	a	1	sure
NWF092	3I	o	1	probably with our clothes
NWF092	3I	s	1	probably with our clothes
NWF092	3I	a	1	yeah i'd stick it with 
NWF092	3I	o	1	yeah i'd stick it with 
NWF092	3I	o	1	our box stuff
NWF092	3I	o	1	we don't seem to have cleaning supplies
NWF092	3I	t	1	we don't seem to have cleaning supplies
NWF092	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF092	3I	o	2	that's like we have scissors
NWF092	3I	o	1	bathroom
NWF092	3I	r	2	well we kinda used up our bathroom space 
NWF092	3I	c	2	well we kinda used up our bathroom space 
NWF092	3I	o	2	i wonder if we could just
NWF092	3I	o	1	put it on 
NWF092	3I	a	1	that's what i was just gonna say 
NWF092	3I	o	1	if we have more bathroom stuff we can put it there let's put it up here with the pre cut wood
NWF092	3I	a	1	yeah by the figs 
NWF092	3I	c	1	it's all dry
NWF092	3I	a	2	sure 
NWF092	3I	o	2	put it between the cookies and the sugar
NWF092	3I	o	1	i would put it maybe over
NWF092	3I	f	1	i would put it maybe over
NWF092	3I	o	1	i feel like on this
NWF092	3I	f	1	i feel like on this
NWF092	3I	o	1	our random
NWF092	3I	t	1	our random
NWF092	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF092	3I	a	1	they could fit there
NWF092	3I	a	1	either or
NWF092	3I	s	1	fish hooks f
NWF092	3I	o	1	fish hooks f
NWF092	3I	o	1	stick wi by the peat moss
NWF092	3I	o	2	by bundles of sticks
NWF092	3I	s	2	by bundles of sticks
NWF092	3I	f	0	maybe
NWF092	3I	o	0	maybe
NWF092	3I	s	0	maybe
NWF092	3I	f	1	by the books of matches or the boating supplies
NWF092	3I	o	1	by the books of matches or the boating supplies
NWF092	3I	s	1	by the books of matches or the boating supplies
NWF092	3I	o	1	we'll stick it there
NWF092	3I	a	2	yes sure next to soybeans 
NWF092	3I	c	2	that makes sense
NWF092	3I	x	2	ended up using all of our 
NWF092	3I	a	2	above toys yeah
NWF092	3I	a	2	since we might as well since we have all this space for food
NWF092	3I	c	2	since we might as well since we have all this space for food
NWF092	3I	o	1	so somewhere over here
NWF092	3I	a	2	i know i know i don't know if ours is any better
NWF092	3I	t	2	i know i know i don't know if ours is any better
NWF092	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWF092	3I	c	1	that sounds l logical
NWF092	3I	a	1	boating supplies
NWF092	3I	o	2	i think that's a little better
NWF092	3I	t	2	i think that's a little better
NWF092	3I	o	1	i mean this is a little confusing but that's okay
NWF092	3I	t	1	i mean this is a little confusing but that's okay
NWF092	3I	a	0	i know
NWM054	6B	o	2	this is gonna be more like ideological 
NWM054	6B	o	2	look at these
NWM054	6B	a	1	mm hm i think we should read through the whole list
NWM054	6B	b	0	mm
NWM054	6B	b	1	mm hm
NWM054	6B	o	2	i think the sugar free juice machines 
NWM054	6B	c	2	can bring it from home
NWM054	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM054	6B	o	2	um do we wanna do one from each category you wanna do one from each and then
NWM054	6B	s	2	um do we wanna do one from each category you wanna do one from each and then
NWM054	6B	o	1	maybe more
NWM054	6B	s	1	maybe more
NWM054	6B	a	1	mm kay
NWM054	6B	a	2	so definitely sugar free juice machines
NWM054	6B	t	0	oh okay
NWM054	6B	o	2	i think that's important 
NWM054	6B	c	2	people need extra help
NWM054	6B	c	2	particularly with math
NWM054	6B	a	1	i agree
NWM054	6B	o	1	d depends on how b large of a school too
NWM054	6B	a	2	then definitely
NWM054	6B	a	1	i think it's important too
NWM054	6B	c	0	mine neither
NWM054	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM054	6B	o	2	i think it's important for public health too 
NWM054	6B	c	2	if you wanna keep like teenage pregnancies down 
NWM054	6B	a	2	okay so we'll keep that for sure 
NWM054	6B	o	2	custodians clearly important
NWM054	6B	s	0	speech therapy
NWM054	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	c	1	maybe that could be outsourced too
NWM054	6B	o	1	maybe that could be outsourced too
NWM054	6B	d	3	i think y we have to remember that the the extra curricular stuff is important 
NWM054	6B	o	3	like i would definitely not wanna get rid of the poetry or the cooking class 
NWM054	6B	c	3	like i would definitely not wanna get rid of the poetry or the cooking class 
NWM054	6B	c	3	so we probably gotta keep the football equipment for that kinda
NWM054	6B	o	3	so we probably gotta keep the football equipment for that kinda
NWM054	6B	o	1	similarly the arts probably kind of important
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	a	1	individual
NWM054	6B	a	1	i agree
NWM054	6B	a	1	i completely agree
NWM054	6B	a	2	you're right 
NWM054	6B	c	2	i didn't think about it that way so
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah think we should keep that
NWM054	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM054	6B	c	2	that's already funded right
NWM054	6B	s	2	that's already funded right
NWM054	6B	o	1	i think that's really important
NWM054	6B	c	2	people don't know how to take care of themselves 
NWM054	6B	o	2	i think that's really important
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	c	1	that's required by law to be available 
NWM054	6B	o	1	so we gotta keep that
NWM054	6B	o	1	cut that
NWM054	6B	o	1	i think that's another thing we could get rid of
NWM054	6B	c	1	that's really specific
NWM054	6B	t	1	that's really specific
NWM054	6B	o	1	i think that's really important
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM054	6B	o	1	and i think we could go back if we wanted to and get rid of right there 
NWM054	6B	a	1	okay
NWM054	6B	o	0	that's like sex ed but for adults 
NWM054	6B	s	0	right
NWM054	6B	o	1	i think that's important
NWM054	6B	o	1	i think that's also really important
NWM054	6B	o	1	it probably depends on whether you're old i 
NWM054	6B	f	1	think
NWM054	6B	b	1	mm hm
NWM054	6B	b	1	mm
NWM054	6B	a	1	i have the same feeling about that one it
NWM054	6B	o	1	i think that's important
NWM054	6B	s	1	invasive species removal 
NWM054	6B	o	1	invasive species removal 
NWM054	6B	o	1	i think we could get rid of weed an weed control
NWM054	6B	c	2	if it's about being pretty rather than like destroying the the area
NWM054	6B	s	0	to get rid of
NWM054	6B	o	1	should keep that 
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	a	1	they could go together
NWM054	6B	b	1	mm
NWM054	6B	a	1	clearly
NWM054	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	c	2	if it's a time of cuts 
NWM054	6B	o	2	it might not be time to make an addition too
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	a	1	me too
NWM054	6B	o	1	that seems important 
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	a	1	definitely
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah you can't get rid of that
NWM054	6B	a	1	we'll cut that one 
NWM054	6B	o	1	think that's gonna be our one
NWM054	6B	o	1	gotta keep that
NWM054	6B	s	0	neighborhood watch support
NWM054	6B	o	1	i don't feel that
NWM054	6B	o	1	importantly about that one
NWM054	6B	o	1	that could be like the next on the list to go
NWM054	6B	o	2	keep it 
NWM054	6B	c	2	otherwise the cat population just explodes
NWM054	6B	s	0	that like classifieds
NWM054	6B	o	0	that like classifieds
NWM054	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM054	6B	o	1	maybe it's like postings about things that are going on in the community
NWM054	6B	s	1	maybe it's like postings about things that are going on in the community
NWM054	6B	c	0	considering the category
NWM054	6B	o	0	considering the category
NWM054	6B	o	2	that's i mean it's tha that would be important 
NWM054	6B	c	2	as far as like keeping a community feeling like a com community 
NWM054	6B	r	2	but uh
NWM054	6B	b	1	mm
NWM054	6B	o	1	i think it could be low on the priority list but probably we'd like to keep it
NWM054	6B	a	1	very yeah
NWM054	6B	o	0	that's like not in addition that's like in addition to what's in the schools 
NWM054	6B	s	0	right
NWM054	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM054	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah yeah
NWM054	6B	c	1	otherwise they're gonna get euthanized 
NWM054	6B	s	1	right
NWM054	6B	i	3	oh my god 
NWM054	6B	t	3	oh my god 
NWM054	6B	o	3	i can't have that
NWM054	6B	t	3	i can't have that
NWM054	6B	o	1	soup kitchens obviously have to keep that
NWM054	6B	o	1	really important
NWM054	6B	s	0	is that even something that still exists
NWM054	6B	t	0	is that even something that still exists
NWM054	6B	o	1	i don't know if it's high priority 
NWM054	6B	c	1	if you're looking at like cutting a food bank or cutting a dog catcher
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	s	0	oh you've never seen that 
NWM054	6B	c	0	it's a station where pretty much anybody can have a show
NWM054	6B	c	0	any kind of show yeah it's on t v
NWM054	6B	o	2	it's usually very weird
NWM054	6B	c	0	like wayne's world actually 
NWM054	6B	t	0	like wayne's world actually 
NWM054	6B	c	0	that that whole idea behind that yeah on t v
NWM054	6B	o	2	i think that could be towards the bottom of the priority list though
NWM054	6B	a	1	or public access 
NWM054	6B	t	1	or public access 
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM054	6B	o	1	i would cut that before i would cut the dog catcher too
NWM054	6B	a	1	i agree
NWM054	6B	b	1	mm hm 
NWM054	6B	a	1	then it's important 
NWM054	6B	b	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	b	2	yeah 
NWM054	6B	x	2	well i mean if we're not gonna 
NWM054	6B	c	2	they have to upkeep it if it's gonna get used 
NWM054	6B	s	2	right
NWM054	6B	s	1	how bout pest control 
NWM054	6B	o	1	clearly 
NWM054	6B	c	1	i mean we can't have like county property that's covered in
NWM054	6B	c	0	bugs or mice
NWM054	6B	s	0	so out of that list
NWM054	6B	o	1	access public access station 
NWM054	6B	f	1	i think
NWM054	6B	o	2	or
NWM054	6B	s	2	or
NWM054	6B	o	2	could the public access station show the news ads
NWM054	6B	s	2	could the public access station show the news ads
NWM054	6B	o	1	and get rid of the news ads
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM054	6B	c	1	i w f feeling it would be in th the back of something like a like a stranger or something like that
NWM054	6B	t	1	i w f feeling it would be in th the back of something like a like a stranger or something like that
NWM054	6B	s	1	i w f feeling it would be in th the back of something like a like a stranger or something like that
NWM054	6B	o	1	let's get rid of the
NWM054	6B	o	1	the news ads and keep the station 
NWM054	6B	o	1	they can have like a thing where they show the 
NWM054	6B	o	1	gonna stay 
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	o	2	absolutely has to stay 
NWM054	6B	a	2	yes
NWM054	6B	b	1	mm hm
NWM054	6B	d	2	the one thing i was thinking of is if you gotta choose between bu additional bus stops or taxi stops 
NWM054	6B	c	2	the one thing i was thinking of is if you gotta choose between bu additional bus stops or taxi stops 
NWM054	6B	c	2	taxis are a a private thing 
NWM054	6B	a	2	yeah
NWM054	6B	o	1	i would keep the bus stops
NWM054	6B	b	0	hm
NWM054	6B	s	1	regulation of that 
NWM054	6B	o	1	regulation of that 
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah definitely
NWM054	6B	c	1	if you're near water 
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	a	1	well i think if you cut those thing people are just gonna do it without
NWM054	6B	c	1	well i think if you cut those thing people are just gonna do it without
NWM054	6B	o	1	gotta gotta keep that
NWM054	6B	s	1	right 
NWM054	6B	c	1	cuz people can't drive on the s on the streets
NWM054	6B	t	1	cuz people can't drive on the s on the streets
NWM054	6B	s	0	is it already existing 
NWM054	6B	o	0	i would assume
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	c	0	i don't either
NWM054	6B	a	0	i don't either
NWM054	6B	s	0	is that like i'm assuming the same as a license
NWM054	6B	o	0	is that like i'm assuming the same as a license
NWM054	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM054	6B	c	1	so it's not just everybody going for
NWM054	6B	s	1	so it's not just everybody going for
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM054	6B	c	1	cuz then y what if you have like a
NWM054	6B	r	1	mm well i'm thinking
NWM054	6B	o	1	it's probably not as important as far as like uh
NWM054	6B	o	2	punishing people for parking in the wrong spot 
NWM054	6B	c	2	but what if you have like a broken down car in downtown forever you wanna get that outta there
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	c	1	i mean i just keep thinking we're only gonna have to get rid of one outta here 
NWM054	6B	o	1	and i think taxi stops are it
NWM054	6B	o	1	and then just to talk about the last three fishing licenses again we wanna regulate it
NWM054	6B	o	1	very important
NWM054	6B	o	1	also 
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah things can flood
NWM054	6B	c	1	yeah things can flood
NWM054	6B	a	1	oh yeah
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM054	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF092	6B	a	1	i know
NWF092	6B	t	1	i know
NWF092	6B	o	1	why don't we
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah let's 
NWF092	6B	o	1	and then why don't we read through like the whole list
NWF092	6B	s	1	and then why don't we read through like the whole list
NWF092	6B	o	1	first 
NWF092	6B	s	1	first 
NWF092	6B	s	1	do you think
NWF092	6B	o	1	and then maybe come up with like
NWF092	6B	f	1	and then maybe come up with like
NWF092	6B	o	1	the one that you would
NWF092	6B	f	1	the one that you would
NWF092	6B	o	2	if you re like if you put them in like most important to like least important
NWF092	6B	o	1	like in your head 
NWF092	6B	f	1	i don't know
NWF092	6B	o	1	i would p
NWF092	6B	s	0	did you did you finish
NWF092	6B	a	3	i was just gonna say the sugar free juice machine 
NWF092	6B	t	3	i was just gonna say the sugar free juice machine 
NWF092	6B	a	3	yeah 
NWF092	6B	c	3	you could they don't need juice you could just drink water 
NWF092	6B	a	3	that's what i would cut too
NWF092	6B	o	2	yeah 
NWF092	6B	r	2	i wonder 
NWF092	6B	o	2	yeah we could probably maybe
NWF092	6B	f	2	yeah we could probably maybe
NWF092	6B	o	1	why don't we like cut one and then if we need to go back an
NWF092	6B	o	0	cut more
NWF092	6B	x	0	oh we must discuss each item okay okay 
NWF092	6B	t	0	okay just kidding 
NWF092	6B	x	0	math tutors
NWF092	6B	a	1	i think that's important
NWF092	6B	a	1	yes
NWF092	6B	f	0	assistant cooks
NWF092	6B	o	2	i would personally probably put on the like not quite as important
NWF092	6B	f	2	i would personally probably put on the like not quite as important
NWF092	6B	f	1	i don't know
NWF092	6B	a	2	a school 
NWF092	6B	s	2	right 
NWF092	6B	a	2	i mean if there's like a thousand kids like
NWF092	6B	c	2	i mean if there's like a thousand kids like
NWF092	6B	a	2	two cooks we'd probably need more 
NWF092	6B	c	2	two cooks we'd probably need more 
NWF092	6B	o	2	i feel like sex ed's important i think it's really important for people 
NWF092	6B	f	2	i don't know 
NWF092	6B	c	2	my school district didn't do a lot of sex ed education and 
NWF092	6B	c	2	it's like that's kind of important and it's kind of just biology 
NWF092	6B	o	2	it's like that's kind of important and it's kind of just biology 
NWF092	6B	x	2	so you c should
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah yes down
NWF092	6B	a	2	yeah they're important 
NWF092	6B	o	2	speech therapy can be important 
NWF092	6B	f	2	speech therapy can be important 
NWF092	6B	c	2	being in speech like if somebody's in like the speech department 
NWF092	6B	f	2	i it also is only serves a select
NWF092	6B	c	2	i it also is only serves a select
NWF092	6B	f	2	population 
NWF092	6B	c	2	population 
NWF092	6B	o	2	and so like if i personally was on a budget committee i would probably look to see what
NWF092	6B	f	1	i don't know
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah yeah that's what i m mean 
NWF092	6B	f	1	i guess
NWF092	6B	a	2	is important yeah
NWF092	6B	a	1	cooking classes yeah
NWF092	6B	a	1	for th equally
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF092	6B	f	2	yeah 
NWF092	6B	d	2	the only thing about acting coaches if it said like drama teacher 
NWF092	6B	c	2	the only thing about acting coaches if it said like drama teacher 
NWF092	6B	o	2	i would say no no no keep it 
NWF092	6B	f	2	but like for me 
NWF092	6B	c	2	when i see the word coach 
NWF092	6B	o	2	i think of like
NWF092	6B	c	2	i think of like
NWF092	6B	o	2	like yeah like an individualized thing 
NWF092	6B	c	2	like yeah like an individualized thing 
NWF092	6B	o	2	and so i wouldn't want to cut like a drama department 
NWF092	6B	c	2	but if it was like
NWF092	6B	c	2	extra coaching 
NWF092	6B	o	2	i might say oh well
NWF092	6B	o	2	you have a drama teacher
NWF092	6B	f	1	i mean it kinda depends
NWF092	6B	f	2	mean and i don't know 
NWF092	6B	c	2	cuz this is kinda vague 
NWF092	6B	f	2	so i don't know what that's referring to 
NWF092	6B	o	2	but poetry books i think are probably important for the library 
NWF092	6B	d	2	although if you're gonna cut shouldn't you already have your 
NWF092	6B	o	2	although if you're gonna cut shouldn't you already have your 
NWF092	6B	s	2	although if you're gonna cut shouldn't you already have your 
NWF092	6B	f	2	i mean lot's of po i don't know they're 
NWF092	6B	c	2	not gonna like throw the books away
NWF092	6B	a	2	i think it's important too 
NWF092	6B	c	2	people don't know how to cook 
NWF092	6B	o	2	i think they're kind of important 
NWF092	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF092	6B	f	2	i mean i could see like i don't know 
NWF092	6B	c	2	you don't need to offer ten cooking classes 
NWF092	6B	o	2	but i think it's important to at least have a couple
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah i'm pretty sure that's yeah 
NWF092	6B	o	1	kicked those out
NWF092	6B	o	1	i think that is 
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF092	6B	c	1	like i feel like you can incorporate th them somewhere else
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF092	6B	a	1	would say that's important to keep 
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF092	6B	a	1	okay check
NWF092	6B	t	1	okay check
NWF092	6B	a	0	so we cut
NWF092	6B	a	0	sugar free juice machines
NWF092	6B	a	1	get rid of more
NWF092	6B	o	1	i think 
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah i think so i think that's important yeah
NWF092	6B	o	1	i think that's important i th i think they can get it i do i don't 
NWF092	6B	f	1	really know 
NWF092	6B	o	1	i should probably know
NWF092	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF092	6B	c	2	i would say cuz i personally didn't have a vaccination because
NWF092	6B	c	0	i got it when i was little
NWF092	6B	o	2	important but also for chicken pox 
NWF092	6B	f	2	important but also for chicken pox 
NWF092	6B	c	2	i if it was just like vaccinations in general 
NWF092	6B	o	2	i'd be like that's important 
NWF092	6B	o	2	but for chicken pox especially cuz it's not like
NWF092	6B	c	2	but for chicken pox especially cuz it's not like
NWF092	6B	o	1	it's not super bad 
NWF092	6B	r	1	so i don't know 
NWF092	6B	c	1	i've haven't read the other ones on the list 
NWF092	6B	r	1	so i don't know
NWF092	6B	a	2	like it's important 
NWF092	6B	r	2	like it's important 
NWF092	6B	r	2	yeah i
NWF092	6B	x	2	versus like a invasive species 
NWF092	6B	o	2	i would maybe like
NWF092	6B	a	1	weed control
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF092	6B	a	2	oh yeah i totally didn't even 
NWF092	6B	a	2	yeah i tend to think of just all weeds as like bad 
NWF092	6B	c	2	yeah i tend to think of just all weeds as like bad 
NWF092	6B	a	2	but yeah there's invasive species versus yeah so we could probably 
NWF092	6B	c	2	like if we had to pick between the two 
NWF092	6B	a	2	i'd yeah pick the weed control to go
NWF092	6B	o	2	i think that's important i feel like 
NWF092	6B	o	2	these were my departments that i would like
NWF092	6B	o	2	have them try to consolidate like that's important 
NWF092	6B	o	2	you can't like just dump it down the drain
NWF092	6B	c	2	you can't like just dump it down the drain
NWF092	6B	o	2	i mean keeping your hospitals up is nice 
NWF092	6B	o	2	feel like there's too much we don't know like is our hospital old and sagging or
NWF092	6B	c	2	feel like there's too much we don't know like is our hospital old and sagging or
NWF092	6B	s	2	feel like there's too much we don't know like is our hospital old and sagging or
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah yeah 
NWF092	6B	o	1	like maybe maybe wait a little bit 
NWF092	6B	f	1	like maybe maybe wait a little bit 
NWF092	6B	o	1	i think that's really important
NWF092	6B	o	1	that seems important 
NWF092	6B	c	1	and i think people would be upset if people cut it 
NWF092	6B	o	1	and i think people would be upset if people cut it 
NWF092	6B	o	1	i think that's important
NWF092	6B	a	1	weed control we said i think that we'd cut that one
NWF092	6B	f	1	weed control we said i think that we'd cut that one
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF092	6B	o	1	yeah th think that's important
NWF092	6B	a	1	important either
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF092	6B	a	1	i definitely agree there
NWF092	6B	a	1	the cats are yeah
NWF092	6B	o	1	i think the newspaper's important not sure
NWF092	6B	o	2	i feel like but i feel like advertisements bring you money so
NWF092	6B	c	2	i feel like but i feel like advertisements bring you money so
NWF092	6B	o	1	know what they would be 
NWF092	6B	f	1	know what they would be 
NWF092	6B	f	1	i guess i'm kinda confused on that one
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF092	6B	c	1	especially
NWF092	6B	c	1	especially i feel like in a depends on the size of our like
NWF092	6B	c	1	of our city 
NWF092	6B	f	1	i don't know 
NWF092	6B	o	1	if it's a huge like seattle like community news ads are
NWF092	6B	c	1	if it's a huge like seattle like community news ads are
NWF092	6B	x	1	of a c county 
NWF092	6B	o	1	so that's that's a that's a whole county that's a pretty big
NWF092	6B	o	1	area
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF092	6B	a	1	probably yeah 
NWF092	6B	o	1	that's important 
NWF092	6B	o	1	think it's
NWF092	6B	f	1	think it's
NWF092	6B	o	1	nice
NWF092	6B	c	1	for like cheaper than joining like a y m c a 
NWF092	6B	o	1	so that might be nice 
NWF092	6B	f	1	i don't know i haven't read the gonna read the other ones
NWF092	6B	f	2	i don't know 
NWF092	6B	o	2	i think it's important to stay active 
NWF092	6B	f	2	but 
NWF092	6B	o	2	kitten puppy adoption
NWF092	6B	i	2	kitten puppy adoption
NWF092	6B	a	3	yeah th 
NWF092	6B	a	3	would mean i would cry

NWF092	6B	o	1	soup kitchens are important
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF092	6B	r	2	eh i feel like if i ha
NWF092	6B	c	2	i i d i f saw it on the hundred and one dalmatians 
NWF092	6B	f	2	but i don't i don't actually know if that's real 
NWF092	6B	o	2	it's probably not real life i think they do have them but
NWF092	6B	a	2	yeah cutting a dog catcher 
NWF092	6B	o	2	i'd definitely cut the dog catcher
NWF092	6B	o	1	i feel like that's kinda like the junior soccer league
NWF092	6B	i	0	what's a public access station 
NWF092	6B	o	0	i don't even know what that i no i don't know what that is
NWF092	6B	s	0	like a a show
NWF092	6B	s	0	what do you mean like
NWF092	6B	x	1	oh i didn't know that 
NWF092	6B	o	1	that's kinda cool
NWF092	6B	a	2	yeah i wanna say 
NWF092	6B	c	2	i wouldn't i mean you know soup kitchen or 
NWF092	6B	o	2	i would probably cut the public acid 
NWF092	6B	c	2	cuz the dog catcher i mean if you don't if people don't know that they're missing it if they don't know that they
NWF092	6B	c	2	had a public access station that
NWF092	6B	c	1	they wouldn't
NWF092	6B	c	1	care 
NWF092	6B	f	1	i don't know
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF092	6B	o	1	vet hospital i think is important
NWF092	6B	r	2	y uh i 
NWF092	6B	f	2	i don't know 
NWF092	6B	c	2	like in f in puyallup like the football stadium
NWF092	6B	c	2	is like all three high schools use it foot football teams use it like the parks and recs teams um they do like cancer walks there like it's it's like community it's a community thing 
NWF092	6B	o	2	so i think that would be important
NWF092	6B	f	2	i don't know like a high school like practice field that
NWF092	6B	c	2	i don't know like a high school like practice field that
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah

NWF092	6B	o	1	i don't know i would probably cut
NWF092	6B	f	1	i don't know i would probably cut
NWF092	6B	a	1	i that's what i would probably cut
NWF092	6B	x	1	oh 
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah we could do that
NWF092	6B	r	1	yeah we could do that
NWF092	6B	a	2	i know 
NWF092	6B	t	2	i know 
NWF092	6B	s	2	can we maybe 
NWF092	6B	f	2	i don't i just like 
NWF092	6B	o	2	i feel like especially
NWF092	6B	x	2	community news ad
NWF092	6B	o	2	i don't even know what t where to get that
NWF092	6B	t	2	i don't even know what t where to get that
NWF092	6B	a	1	probably
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah maybe
NWF092	6B	a	1	the news ads keep the stat public access station
NWF092	6B	a	1	okay that sounds good
NWF092	6B	o	2	okay this'll be that's is kind of important i think that's a no brainer 
NWF092	6B	t	2	this road is sixty now um
NWF092	6B	o	2	i maybe wouldn't say additional bus stops 
NWF092	6B	f	2	i maybe wouldn't say additional bus stops 
NWF092	6B	c	2	because that to me sounds like they already have ten and we wanna add more
NWF092	6B	o	2	because that to me sounds like they already have ten and we wanna add more
NWF092	6B	o	2	i would choose the bus 
NWF092	6B	a	2	yeah a private service so 
NWF092	6B	c	2	i would pick the more 
NWF092	6B	o	2	oh yeah didn't even i should read all these first
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah i definitely would
NWF092	6B	a	2	yeah i would too 
NWF092	6B	c	2	if i mean if it was that and the taxi stops 
NWF092	6B	o	2	i feel like that's really important 
NWF092	6B	c	2	um only because people ar get tattoos and it'd be it's good to have some you know oversight 
NWF092	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF092	6B	o	2	especially in washington
NWF092	6B	c	2	especially in washington
NWF092	6B	c	2	i mean if you're in montana there's not a whole lot you're gonna boat on
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah but if you specially in washington i feel like that's kind of important
NWF092	6B	c	1	yeah but if you specially in washington i feel like that's kind of important
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah with yeah
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWF092	6B	c	1	otherwise you're 
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF092	6B	o	1	i i would s i would think that it was already existing so i'd say that's probably important to like keep it up 
NWF092	6B	c	1	i i would s i would think that it was already existing so i'd say that's probably important to like keep it up 
NWF092	6B	s	1	hunting tags i don't know what a hunting tag is
NWF092	6B	t	1	hunting tags i don't know what a hunting tag is

NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF092	6B	o	1	i think
NWF092	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF092	6B	c	2	especially i mean you've been on i five you know when it's like there's a literally a car blocking an entire lane of traffic you know and it's like you need to get that hauled away
NWF092	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF092	6B	a	1	a taxi stops is probably the one we're gonna get rid of yeah
NWF092	6B	o	1	that's important 
NWF092	6B	a	1	yep
NWF092	6B	a	2	especially especially in washington 
NWF092	6B	c	2	especially especially in washington 
NWF092	6B	a	2	know 
NWF092	6B	c	2	y you look at like you see like it pour down rain in arizona and there's just like water everywhere cuz they don't have any d drainage ditches 
NWF092	6B	o	2	i think we did good
NWF092	6B	e	2	i think we did good
NWF092	6B	o	1	i think it would be actually really harder cuz we didn't have to cut
NWF092	6B	t	1	i think it would be actually really harder cuz we didn't have to cut
NWF092	6B	o	1	that
NWM055	3I	o	1	so we can start out by like taking a few 
NWM055	3I	o	1	or do you wanna just talk about how it is first
NWM055	3I	s	1	or do you wanna just talk about how it is first
NWM055	3I	a	1	yeah

NWM055	3I	c	1	cuz we don't have milk
NWM055	3I	s	1	where would you put like produce 
NWM055	3I	o	1	i guess beets were really the only thing on there that would be
NWM055	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM055	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM055	3I	s	1	what about like toiletry stuff 
NWM055	3I	o	1	i was thinking here but
NWM055	3I	o	2	definitely wetsuits i'd put close to the boating supplies
NWM055	3I	o	1	like fish hooks and
NWM055	3I	o	1	we al we didn't talk about where we're gonna put clothing
NWM055	3I	o	1	i wonder if we have enough space to have a cl clothing section here or something
NWM055	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWM055	3I	o	2	and like have few tools here maybe
NWM055	3I	f	2	and like have few tools here maybe

NWM055	3I	s	2	so hats maybe up here
NWM055	3I	o	2	i'd either put it with the power cords or with the siding
NWM055	3I	o	1	right there
NWM055	3I	o	1	like here
NWM055	3I	s	1	like here
NWM055	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWM055	3I	o	2	i have egg timers which i think should go with the refrigerator magnets
NWM055	3I	s	1	above it or below it
NWM055	3I	o	2	i would say kitchen y stuff but
NWM055	3I	o	1	with the travel guides
NWM055	3I	o	1	like up here 
NWM055	3I	s	1	like up here 
NWM055	3I	a	1	yeah cuz we have books

NWM055	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM055	3I	o	2	right by the heavy cable
NWM055	3I	a	1	that sounds good
NWM055	3I	o	2	we could have a sweet section here with chocolate bars boxes of doughnuts cake
NWM055	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWM055	3I	d	2	but that's more like baking stuff 
NWM055	3I	a	2	yeah
NWM055	3I	o	2	do we want it up close to the ice cream
NWM055	3I	s	2	do we want it up close to the ice cream
NWM055	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM055	3I	a	2	yeah that's a good idea also 
NWM055	3I	e	2	yeah that's a good idea also 
NWM055	3I	c	2	like thinking of like what people would buy together
NWM055	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM055	3I	x	2	do we have a weapons 
NWM055	3I	o	2	should be with the tools
NWM055	3I	o	2	question is heavy cable area or the power cords down here
NWM055	3I	s	2	question is heavy cable area or the power cords down here
NWM055	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM055	3I	a	1	yeah the electric heaters
NWM055	3I	o	1	well i can hold on to it and we can
NWM055	3I	o	2	yeah the outdoor thing 
NWM055	3I	a	2	yeah the outdoor thing 
NWM055	3I	o	2	maybe like underneath the siding 
NWM055	3I	s	2	maybe like underneath the siding 
NWM055	3I	f	2	maybe like underneath the siding 
NWM055	3I	f	2	i don't know
NWM055	3I	o	2	we could also just make it a really confusing store so that then people would be like looking for one thing and then you find something else
NWM055	3I	t	2	we could also just make it a really confusing store so that then people would be like looking for one thing and then you find something else
NWM055	3I	b	0	hm

NWM055	3I	o	1	i mean
NWM055	3I	o	2	i'll just put it here
NWM055	3I	a	2	yeah that's what i was thinking 
NWM055	3I	o	2	the electric heaters y we were saying could go near the power cords
NWM055	3I	a	2	the electric heaters y we were saying could go near the power cords
NWM055	3I	o	1	pre cut wood here maybe
NWM055	3I	s	1	pre cut wood here maybe
NWM055	3I	o	2	maybe with the kitchen stuff

NWM055	3I	o	2	or could it go with the mousetraps
NWM055	3I	c	1	because i'm thinking what else would go in that category
NWM055	3I	c	2	cuz this could be like kind of a tool wrap around
NWM055	3I	c	2	usually don't they have them closer to the front's of stores so they can see people stealing
NWM055	3I	s	2	usually don't they have them closer to the front's of stores so they can see people stealing

NWM055	3I	o	1	bagels i think that's an easier solution
NWM055	3I	o	2	i'd put it with the pre cut wood
NWM055	3I	c	2	cuz maybe it's like camping y
NWM055	3I	c	0	stuff

NWM055	3I	o	1	right here
NWM055	3I	s	1	right here
NWM055	3I	a	0	we're done
NWM055	3I	t	0	we're done
NWF093	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWF093	3I	o	1	maybe we wanna analyze for a sec 
NWF093	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWF093	3I	o	1	guess i noticed that
NWF093	3I	o	2	yeah definitely food over here 
NWF093	3I	c	2	that looks like the chilled items side
NWF093	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF093	3I	a	1	right right 
NWF093	3I	o	1	yeah baked goods but nothing refrigerated here
NWF093	3I	a	1	true 
NWF093	3I	d	1	dried figs though 
NWF093	3I	c	1	dried figs though 
NWF093	3I	o	1	maybe near soybeans
NWF093	3I	s	1	maybe near soybeans
NWF093	3I	f	1	maybe near soybeans
NWF093	3I	o	1	in that sort of area 
NWF093	3I	s	1	in that sort of area 
NWF093	3I	r	1	although i guess we have 
NWF093	3I	o	1	so i guess we would populate both sides of that so we would still have that side all empty
NWF093	3I	f	1	i don't know
NWF093	3I	e	1	that's a good
NWF093	3I	a	1	that's a good one yeah
NWF093	3I	e	1	that's a good one yeah
NWF093	3I	e	1	i like that idea
NWF093	3I	a	1	yes
NWF093	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF093	3I	o	1	do you wanna try some 
NWF093	3I	s	1	do you wanna try some 
NWF093	3I	o	1	guess i'll grab a handful
NWF093	3I	t	0	trying to be quiet with them
NWF093	3I	a	2	no we didn't
NWF093	3I	a	2	yeah i was wondering that too 
NWF093	3I	o	2	i bet if we crammed the hardware store things there we could
NWF093	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWF093	3I	a	1	maybe this is just kind of a wrap around like there wasn't enough room on that side 
NWF093	3I	c	1	maybe this is just kind of a wrap around like there wasn't enough room on that side 
NWF093	3I	f	1	i don't 
NWF093	3I	a	1	know okay yeah 
NWF093	3I	o	1	go ahead and put
NWF093	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF093	3I	o	1	i'll put that
NWF093	3I	o	1	would that be better with power cords or siding
NWF093	3I	s	1	would that be better with power cords or siding
NWF093	3I	s	1	which do you think
NWF093	3I	a	1	okay
NWF093	3I	s	0	where'd we say uh toiletries
NWF093	3I	o	1	over here 
NWF093	3I	s	1	over here 
NWF093	3I	a	1	okay
NWF093	3I	o	2	i'm gonna
NWF093	3I	o	2	put it here 
NWF093	3I	c	2	so we can work up cuz i forget if how many random things we have
NWF093	3I	a	2	yes definitely
NWF093	3I	o	1	maybe above 
NWF093	3I	f	1	maybe above 
NWF093	3I	c	1	cuz i do i 
NWF093	3I	f	1	i don't know 
NWF093	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF093	3I	o	1	would you say home depot stuff or kitchen y stuff
NWF093	3I	s	1	would you say home depot stuff or kitchen y stuff
NWF093	3I	a	1	okay

NWF093	3I	c	0	they had office things sorta around where
NWF093	3I	a	2	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that sounds good
NWF093	3I	o	1	maybe across from the toys sort 
NWF093	3I	s	1	maybe across from the toys sort 
NWF093	3I	f	1	of well 
NWF093	3I	c	1	cuz they had
NWF093	3I	a	2	yeah they sort of grouped toys and travel guides and books and stuff together and that that seemed to work for me when i read
NWF093	3I	c	2	yeah they sort of grouped toys and travel guides and books and stuff together and that that seemed to work for me when i read
NWF093	3I	o	1	near the toilet paper
NWF093	3I	s	0	was there anything um
NWF093	3I	s	2	like within 
NWF093	3I	a	2	okay yeah 
NWF093	3I	c	2	cuz i was gonna say if there were toiletries that were more
NWF093	3I	c	2	that would go better with toilet 
NWF093	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWF093	3I	o	2	toilet paper 
NWF093	3I	a	2	yeah i think so yeah
NWF093	3I	o	1	i don't know i'm t i c 
NWF093	3I	f	1	i don't know i'm t i c 
NWF093	3I	c	1	don't really remember
NWF093	3I	f	1	don't really remember
NWF093	3I	o	1	i guess i would put with heavy cable 
NWF093	3I	s	1	right
NWF093	3I	o	1	and or
NWF093	3I	r	1	and or
NWF093	3I	o	1	boating supplies 
NWF093	3I	o	1	i guess tow
NWF093	3I	f	1	i guess tow
NWF093	3I	a	1	okay
NWF093	3I	o	1	i would say probably
NWF093	3I	r	2	yeah 
NWF093	3I	c	2	well we do have cake mix and sugar here but those are not ready to eat
NWF093	3I	a	1	okay yeah
NWF093	3I	o	2	i'm gonna put it
NWF093	3I	a	2	yeah we somewhere i was thinking somewhere around here 
NWF093	3I	c	2	cuz then it's like you could wrap around from the sugar if you're feeling sugary 
NWF093	3I	a	2	but yeah ice cream
NWF093	3I	a	1	yeah the flow of traffic
NWF093	3I	a	2	should 
NWF093	3I	t	2	should 
NWF093	3I	a	2	yeah
NWF093	3I	o	2	there were some sort of electrical y things that could go more around the power cords 
NWF093	3I	s	2	weren't there a couple electric type things
NWF093	3I	f	0	i think
NWF093	3I	a	1	yeah okay 
NWF093	3I	o	1	so probably leave at least a space for tha 
NWF093	3I	f	1	i don't know maybe on this side then 
NWF093	3I	s	1	i don't know maybe on this side then 
NWF093	3I	o	1	i don't know maybe on this side then 
NWF093	3I	f	1	not r i'm not really sure
NWF093	3I	a	2	okay
NWF093	3I	o	2	somewhere up here for sure
NWF093	3I	a	1	okay
NWF093	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF093	3I	a	2	yeah yeah kind of surprise them 
NWF093	3I	t	2	yeah yeah kind of surprise them 
NWF093	3I	c	2	i read some or heard some interesting things about f the flow of traffic in in grocery stores people will always tend to like i forget if it was
NWF093	3I	c	0	clockwise or counter clockwise i'm trying to picture what i would do cuz it
NWF093	3I	c	0	i was it like worked for me i don't know people like always move in a certain direction and i think it has something to do with like the uh way you drive in that country what side you drive on people are like used to moving in a certain direction yeah so they'll arrange things like get the the 
NWF093	3I	f	0	i don't know maybe towards
NWF093	3I	f	0	i don't know 
NWF093	3I	c	0	towards one end or the other they'll put things that are more impulse buys because tha people are more likely to impulse buy like at the beginning or end i 
NWF093	3I	f	0	i don't remember the details
NWF093	3I	o	1	well i guess coats 
NWF093	3I	c	1	we have hats 
NWF093	3I	s	1	where are hats
NWF093	3I	a	1	oh yeah okay 
NWF093	3I	o	1	so coats could go up there 
NWF093	3I	a	1	so coats could go up there 
NWF093	3I	a	1	sure
NWF093	3I	o	2	uh i'm gonna put my dried figs next to the soybeans
NWF093	3I	o	1	i'd say
NWF093	3I	r	1	i'd say
NWF093	3I	r	1	oh gosh it's such a big decision 
NWF093	3I	t	1	oh gosh it's such a big decision 
NWF093	3I	f	1	i don't know i yeah i don't really know 
NWF093	3I	o	1	go for 
NWF093	3I	a	1	it okay
NWF093	3I	o	1	would think maybe in this quadrant 
NWF093	3I	s	1	would think maybe in this quadrant 
NWF093	3I	f	1	would think maybe in this quadrant 
NWF093	3I	a	1	okay
NWF093	3I	a	2	yes yes
NWF093	3I	a	1	yeah that works
NWF093	3I	r	1	yeah
NWF093	3I	d	2	y we i don't know about bu 
NWF093	3I	a	2	cups i can see that
NWF093	3I	c	2	but it c i mean it could f i guess flow from kitchen y then to cups then to buckets
NWF093	3I	r	2	but it c i mean it could f i guess flow from kitchen y then to cups then to buckets
NWF093	3I	a	2	but it c i mean it could f i guess flow from kitchen y then to cups then to buckets
NWF093	3I	r	2	but buckets depends 
NWF093	3I	c	2	i mean buckets you use a lot outside
NWF093	3I	a	1	true
NWF093	3I	a	1	okay
NWF093	3I	c	1	don't we have like water jugs and things like that that migh
NWF093	3I	s	1	don't we have like water jugs and things like that that migh
NWF093	3I	o	1	i'm thinking maybe above
NWF093	3I	c	1	cuz mayb 
NWF093	3I	a	1	okay
NWF093	3I	o	1	i feel like this is more like getting more and more sort of
NWF093	3I	f	1	i don't know
NWF093	3I	o	1	small and delicate
NWF093	3I	c	2	i don't think we're gonna have enough clothing to fills all this 
NWF093	3I	o	2	you could use some of this space 
NWF093	3I	a	2	yeah yeah 
NWF093	3I	a	2	all the good dangerous things
NWF093	3I	c	2	all the good dangerous things
NWF093	3I	e	1	that's a good point too

NWF093	3I	e	1	yeah go for it
NWF093	3I	a	1	yeah
NWF093	3I	a	1	would make sense

NWM055	6B	c	2	you know urinated in public a few too many times and they're registered as a sex offender
NWM055	6B	a	2	you know urinated in public a few too many times and they're registered as a sex offender

NWM055	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM055	6B	o	2	it seems weird to me that the same county that has a subway would also have
NWM055	6B	t	2	it seems weird to me that the same county that has a subway would also have
NWM055	6B	o	2	hunting and fishing
NWM055	6B	t	2	hunting and fishing
NWM055	6B	c	2	cuz i'm thinking that like a a city that is big enough to have that like level of infrastructure like taxis and uh subway and buses
NWM055	6B	c	2	would also have enough land
NWM055	6B	f	1	i don't know
NWM055	6B	s	0	what are hunting tags
NWM055	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM055	6B	c	3	i mean who really watches the public ass access station 
NWM055	6B	o	3	pretty easy to cut 
NWM055	6B	c	3	and then no one would notice except for like a few people in the retirement home
NWM055	6B	a	0	yeah
NWM055	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM055	6B	a	1	yeah

NWM055	6B	c	0	did you know that the w washington state government gives twice as much money to boeing as it does to the university of washington
NWM055	6B	o	2	isn't that crazy 
NWM055	6B	t	2	isn't that crazy 
NWM055	6B	s	2	isn't that crazy 
NWM055	6B	c	2	i just learned that today
NWM055	6B	c	0	to keep them in state
NWM055	6B	c	2	it'd be equally important to invest at least equally important to invest in like the biggest university and research
NWM055	6B	f	1	i dunno
NWM055	6B	o	2	well fortunately it seems like we have similar values 
NWM055	6B	t	2	well fortunately it seems like we have similar values 
NWM055	6B	c	2	this could be easier
NWM055	6B	o	2	we can start with two from each
NWM055	6B	o	2	let's cut note takers
NWM055	6B	o	1	from disability services
NWM055	6B	c	2	cuz you can get students to do that 
NWM055	6B	a	2	yeah
NWM055	6B	o	2	sugar free juice machines screw em we don't need em
NWM055	6B	t	2	sugar free juice machines screw em we don't need em
NWM055	6B	s	1	what would you cut
NWM055	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM055	6B	o	1	weed control
NWM055	6B	s	1	weed control
NWM055	6B	o	2	we'll just call them plants they're plants
NWM055	6B	o	2	invasive species removal
NWM055	6B	s	2	invasive species removal
NWM055	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM055	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM055	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM055	6B	f	0	i don't know
NWM055	6B	o	0	i was thinking like a community bulletin or something
NWM055	6B	c	0	of like events
NWM055	6B	o	1	i think that's somewhat important
NWM055	6B	a	1	yeah let's cut that
NWM055	6B	o	2	here's my idea
NWM055	6B	o	2	the fans can volunteer
NWM055	6B	a	3	yeah 
NWM055	6B	c	3	if they love to watch football so much 
NWM055	6B	o	3	then they can clean up the stadium
NWM055	6B	d	2	well no no they could like set up
NWM055	6B	o	2	well no no they could like set up
NWM055	6B	f	2	well i guess you'd you'd probably if it's a a real football stadium and not like a high school football stadium you'd need like skilled people to f
NWM055	6B	o	2	well i guess you'd you'd probably if it's a a real football stadium and not like a high school football stadium you'd need like skilled people to f
NWM055	6B	c	2	well i guess you'd you'd probably if it's a a real football stadium and not like a high school football stadium you'd need like skilled people to f
NWM055	6B	c	2	and if it brings in money to the town 
NWM055	6B	o	2	then it maybe it's maybe it's good to have a football stadium
NWM055	6B	o	2	they should just have like a little picture of like
NWM055	6B	t	2	they should just have like a little picture of like
NWM055	6B	o	1	cute kittens and puppies and you know like
NWM055	6B	t	1	cute kittens and puppies and you know like
NWM055	6B	o	1	feel guilty
NWM055	6B	t	1	feel guilty
NWM055	6B	c	1	how many stray dogs are there
NWM055	6B	o	1	i mean it'd be it'd be almost better to just have more like spaying
NWM055	6B	f	1	i mean it'd be it'd be almost better to just have more like spaying
NWM055	6B	x	1	or cats
NWM055	6B	a	0	yeah
NWM055	6B	o	2	public access and maybe the
NWM055	6B	s	2	public access and maybe the
NWM055	6B	o	1	dog catcher
NWM055	6B	s	1	dog catcher
NWM055	6B	c	0	i always picture like 
NWM055	6B	c	0	is that is it the fox and the hound or s 
NWM055	6B	s	0	is that is it the fox and the hound or s 
NWM055	6B	c	0	one of those movies

NWM055	6B	t	2	it's horrifying
NWM055	6B	b	0	yeah
NWM055	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM055	6B	s	0	a g a road a curb
NWM055	6B	o	0	a g a road a curb
NWM055	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM055	6B	t	2	massage cer that's a very specific
NWM055	6B	o	2	massage cer that's a very specific
NWM055	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM055	6B	c	2	and there are only so many tattoo artists and massage therapists who can work in a given area 
NWM055	6B	s	2	right
NWM055	6B	o	2	so maybe then we just decide that we have enough right now
NWM055	6B	o	2	not gonna be accepting any new ones
NWM055	6B	t	2	not gonna be accepting any new ones
NWM055	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM055	6B	o	1	i feel like pothole maintenance is pretty important

NWM055	6B	a	1	i don't either
NWM055	6B	o	0	so we're cutting like
NWM055	6B	o	0	over ten percent of the p of the programs for cut two from each
NWM055	6B	o	1	so that hasta be a pretty good
NWM055	6B	o	1	budget reduction
NWM055	6B	c	2	but then what's the point of having a government if you just cut every service
NWF093	6B	s	1	yeah what else would you cut

NWM059	6B	b	0	mmi hm
NWM059	6B	a	0	yeah
NWM059	6B	a	2	start with two 
NWM059	6B	o	2	two from each 
NWM059	6B	a	2	yeah
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah yeah
NWM059	6B	a	1	alright we'll keep speech therapy
NWM059	6B	o	2	and you gotta have custodians sex ed's really important

NWM059	6B	c	2	cuz we don't need that
NWM059	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM059	6B	c	2	make em pay for it on their own
NWM059	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWM059	6B	c	2	well it's all about whether or not you appreciate the arts

NWM059	6B	o	2	gotta keep poetry gotta keep the arts
NWM059	6B	a	1	yes
NWM059	6B	a	1	yes i think so
NWM059	6B	o	2	it's im portant 
NWM059	6B	c	2	but i don't understand why the government's paying for it
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM059	6B	o	2	you sound like you are very opposed to sugar free juices
NWM059	6B	a	1	it's true
NWM059	6B	o	1	yes that's important and music teachers are important
NWM059	6B	o	2	these are all important things cept for football equipment
NWM059	6B	a	1	okay
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah i don't really care 
NWM059	6B	c	1	i wouldn't ever use it myself so
NWM059	6B	a	1	yes
NWM059	6B	o	1	we'll start with those two
NWM059	6B	o	2	that's what i'm assuming 
NWM059	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM059	6B	c	2	they don't need new equipment every year
NWM059	6B	c	1	that's silly
NWM059	6B	a	2	yes
NWM059	6B	c	2	why is that not in education and programs
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah okay
NWM059	6B	o	1	definitely
NWM059	6B	r	2	oh wait a minute
NWM059	6B	f	2	i don't know 
NWM059	6B	c	2	i never got a vaccination
NWM059	6B	c	1	they do now so kids never have chicken pox anymore 
NWM059	6B	s	1	they do now so kids never have chicken pox anymore 
NWM059	6B	c	1	they're missing out on an important part of childhood
NWM059	6B	t	1	they're missing out on an important part of childhood
NWM059	6B	o	2	i'd say we get rid of that one let them have chicken pox for awhile
NWM059	6B	t	2	i'd say we get rid of that one let them have chicken pox for awhile
NWM059	6B	c	2	sit at home in a oatmeal bath
NWM059	6B	t	2	sit at home in a oatmeal bath
NWM059	6B	a	1	okay
NWM059	6B	o	1	i think so
NWM059	6B	c	2	didn't we have that
NWM059	6B	s	2	didn't we have that
NWM059	6B	c	2	i mean sex ed
NWM059	6B	o	2	it should be part of sex ed
NWM059	6B	a	0	yeah
NWM059	6B	a	2	yeah there's a lot of overlap here
NWM059	6B	c	2	what is it sex ed and reproductive education same thing
NWM059	6B	c	2	oh reproductive education is probably for moms expecting mothers
NWM059	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM059	6B	c	1	i wonder if s t d education is redundant then
NWM059	6B	a	1	probably
NWM059	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWM059	6B	a	1	sure
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM059	6B	r	1	mm maybe i dunno if we need that

NWM059	6B	o	1	no
NWM059	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM059	6B	c	2	well invasive species removal should do enough 
NWM059	6B	a	2	yeah
NWM059	6B	o	2	should be in reproductive education
NWM059	6B	b	0	yeah hm
NWM059	6B	o	1	i guess we hafta keep all of it don't 
NWM059	6B	c	1	just to be safe
NWM059	6B	a	1	okay
NWM059	6B	o	2	that i would say get away give away

NWM059	6B	o	1	chicken pox
NWM059	6B	s	1	chicken pox
NWM059	6B	a	1	right

NWM059	6B	o	1	probably
NWM059	6B	s	1	probably
NWM059	6B	c	1	that's probably a pretty cheap one football equipment's not cheap but junior soccer league should be
NWM059	6B	a	2	then you get adopted yeah 
NWM059	6B	c	2	then you get adopted yeah 
NWM059	6B	o	2	keep that one

NWM059	6B	a	2	yeah
NWM059	6B	f	1	i don't know 
NWM059	6B	o	1	let's see what else we can cut
NWM059	6B	o	1	we need the
NWM059	6B	a	1	probably yeah
NWM059	6B	c	1	i dunno we already cut the equipment 
NWM059	6B	t	1	i dunno we already cut the equipment 
NWM059	6B	o	1	might as well just cut all of that sport 
NWM059	6B	t	1	might as well just cut all of that sport 
NWM059	6B	f	1	no 
NWM059	6B	t	1	no 
NWM059	6B	o	1	let's keep that one
NWM059	6B	o	1	probably need that as well
NWM059	6B	c	1	probably need that as well
NWM059	6B	o	1	so we could cut
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah boys basketball 
NWM059	6B	o	1	and either stray cat spaying or community news ads
NWM059	6B	s	1	and either stray cat spaying or community news ads

NWM059	6B	o	2	keep that
NWM059	6B	t	2	keep that
NWM059	6B	c	1	are we increasing the budget if we keep that
NWM059	6B	s	1	are we increasing the budget if we keep that
NWM059	6B	o	2	that's silly
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM059	6B	c	2	in in our f in our fictional town i think it runs great but we could use additional
NWM059	6B	t	2	in in our f in our fictional town i think it runs great but we could use additional
NWM059	6B	o	2	i don't think that's necessary
NWM059	6B	a	2	mm mm
NWM059	6B	d	2	well except that's 
NWM059	6B	c	2	what that is is regulating tattoo industry we don't want anyone on the street
NWM059	6B	c	2	puncturing holes in you so
NWM059	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM059	6B	c	2	for public health concerns 
NWM059	6B	o	2	we probably should keep it
NWM059	6B	o	1	probably should keep that too
NWM059	6B	o	1	yeah
NWM059	6B	o	2	we can cut the whole subway system
NWM059	6B	s	2	we can cut the whole subway system
NWM059	6B	t	2	we can cut the whole subway system
NWM059	6B	o	2	with one stroke 
NWM059	6B	s	2	with one stroke 
NWM059	6B	t	2	with one stroke 
NWM059	6B	o	2	that's amazing
NWM059	6B	t	2	that's amazing
NWM059	6B	o	1	let's not do that 
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah let's just keep it
NWM059	6B	o	1	probably 
NWM059	6B	c	1	i dunno
NWM059	6B	f	1	i dunno
NWM059	6B	c	0	how much hunting
NWM059	6B	f	0	how much hunting
NWM059	6B	c	1	so if you got rid of that
NWM059	6B	t	1	must like hunting
NWM059	6B	t	1	squirrels or something
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM059	6B	o	1	no
NWM059	6B	r	1	no
NWM059	6B	o	1	private sector can do that just fine
NWM059	6B	c	1	private sector can do that just fine
NWM059	6B	a	1	kay
NWM059	6B	r	1	don't
NWM059	6B	o	1	don't
NWM059	6B	r	1	need it
NWM059	6B	o	1	need it
NWM059	6B	c	1	i don't know why we would have to certify masseuses
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM059	6B	c	2	well otherwise it could be chaos with taxis stopping everywhere if you have stops it could help a little bit
NWM059	6B	c	2	and if they were there already then it might just be really confusing if you get rid of them all of a sudden
NWM059	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM059	6B	c	1	they've already been there 
NWM059	6B	x	1	keep it around 
NWM059	6B	f	1	i dunno
NWM059	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWM059	6B	o	1	yes
NWM059	6B	o	1	yes
NWM059	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah i think 
NWM059	6B	o	1	good though 
NWM059	6B	c	1	because if we hafta cut the same from every category
NWM059	6B	c	2	it's really hard to cut something from public health and safety
NWM059	6B	c	2	the two that we cut were the only two we could do
NWM059	6B	o	1	or we could do three we could do the chicken pox maybe
NWM059	6B	o	2	oh it was education and programs that one was hard to cut any more than two
NWM059	6B	o	2	unless we cut
NWM059	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM059	6B	c	1	if we cut acting coaches 
NWM059	6B	o	1	which is fine with me cut the acting coaches 
NWM059	6B	c	1	and then
NWM059	6B	c	2	and then we'd have three from each category 
NWM059	6B	o	2	we could do that
NWM059	6B	s	1	how much do you wanna cut
NWM059	6B	a	1	mm kay
NWM059	6B	o	1	then we're good
NWM059	6B	a	1	i think so
NWM059	6B	t	1	i really wish i knew what kind of a town this is
NWF101	6B	o	1	should we figure
NWF101	6B	s	1	should we figure
NWF101	6B	o	1	maybe we should decide a couple to we can talk though them all but we can decide maybe a couple to cut like maybe two to cut from each category
NWF101	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWF101	6B	e	1	then that just keeps it easy and even
NWF101	6B	o	2	well we can't cut speech therapy 
NWF101	6B	c	2	that's the only one i know about
NWF101	6B	a	2	okay 
NWF101	6B	o	2	you hafta have custodians you hafta have sex ed 
NWF101	6B	o	2	assistant cooks
NWF101	6B	f	2	assistant cooks
NWF101	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF101	6B	o	1	that might be one we wanna cut
NWF101	6B	o	1	acting coaches
NWF101	6B	s	1	acting coaches
NWF101	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF101	6B	o	2	i 
NWF101	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF101	6B	o	2	we hafta
NWF101	6B	o	1	decide okay we can keep
NWF101	6B	o	2	acting poetry special ed teachers 
NWF101	6B	c	2	we hafta have those 
NWF101	6B	o	2	cooking classes
NWF101	6B	s	2	cooking classes
NWF101	6B	a	1	yeah i think so too
NWF101	6B	o	1	note takers 
NWF101	6B	s	1	note takers 
NWF101	6B	o	1	yes
NWF101	6B	o	2	that can go
NWF101	6B	a	1	no
NWF101	6B	o	2	i think that one definitely hasta go 
NWF101	6B	c	2	i understand why it's there
NWF101	6B	c	3	because i think 
NWF101	6B	d	3	no i think that's fine the sugar free juices and i what it stands for 
NWF101	6B	c	3	no i think that's fine the sugar free juices and i what it stands for 
NWF101	6B	o	3	no i think that's fine the sugar free juices and i what it stands for 
NWF101	6B	c	3	but i think all the moms can pack sugar free juice if they need to
NWF101	6B	o	1	i'd say yes music teachers yes
NWF101	6B	o	2	okay so let's sen let's cut 
NWF101	6B	c	2	if we hafta cut two things 
NWF101	6B	o	2	let's cut sugar free juice machines 
NWF101	6B	s	2	okay with you
NWF101	6B	o	1	and football equipment
NWF101	6B	s	1	and football equipment
NWF101	6B	c	1	assuming that it's new equipment each year
NWF101	6B	o	2	yes
NWF101	6B	o	1	i think it just goes back to those other categories 
NWF101	6B	c	1	it can be under both
NWF101	6B	o	1	i would say yes
NWF101	6B	o	1	yes
NWF101	6B	s	2	right
NWF101	6B	a	1	i know
NWF101	6B	t	1	i know
NWF101	6B	a	1	it on we'll put it on 
NWF101	6B	o	1	it on we'll put it on 
NWF101	6B	o	1	maybe list
NWF101	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWF101	6B	o	1	yes
NWF101	6B	o	2	okay so that might be on the maybe list too 
NWF101	6B	c	2	cuz that could go under that will go under 
NWF101	6B	a	2	okay yeah that's that's one of ours
NWF101	6B	b	0	yeah
NWF101	6B	c	1	i'm thinking the sex ed is more of the younger age and then reproductive education is once they actually do they're pregnant
NWF101	6B	a	2	i think it is 
NWF101	6B	o	2	i think we should put that on our
NWF101	6B	o	2	maybe list
NWF101	6B	o	1	yes
NWF101	6B	o	2	i think that's important
NWF101	6B	c	2	i think that's important
NWF101	6B	o	2	i think so
NWF101	6B	c	1	depending on what the need is for the community
NWF101	6B	o	1	yes
NWF101	6B	o	2	yes
NWF101	6B	o	1	i think yes
NWF101	6B	a	1	not as important
NWF101	6B	c	1	we have the invasive species removal
NWF101	6B	a	1	okay
NWF101	6B	a	2	it should that 
NWF101	6B	c	2	might be more under the medical side though the education might be more under
NWF101	6B	c	2	they might be two different you know programs doing that
NWF101	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWF101	6B	o	2	i think we do need to keep the prenatal check ups
NWF101	6B	a	2	mm kay 
NWF101	6B	c	2	for funding 
NWF101	6B	o	2	well we only need to choose two
NWF101	6B	o	1	that need to go 
NWF101	6B	c	1	if we want to keep it even
NWF101	6B	o	1	we were definitely going to take out s t d education 
NWF101	6B	c	1	cuz that fell under what we're already paying for over here
NWF101	6B	s	1	and then what's the next least important one
NWF101	6B	r	2	or weed control
NWF101	6B	o	2	or weed control
NWF101	6B	a	1	okay 
NWF101	6B	o	1	we'll keep the other ones
NWF101	6B	o	2	that one's tough
NWF101	6B	t	2	that one's tough
NWF101	6B	t	1	lotsa stray cats
NWF101	6B	o	2	i'd say put that in the no list too 
NWF101	6B	c	2	we'll decide we'll prioritize after
NWF101	6B	o	2	yes
NWF101	6B	o	1	i'd say yes 
NWF101	6B	c	1	compared to the other ones
NWF101	6B	a	1	probably
NWF101	6B	a	1	yeah i agree
NWF101	6B	c	2	well if we gave if we stop spaying the cats then yeah we're gonna need that
NWF101	6B	t	2	well if we gave if we stop spaying the cats then yeah we're gonna need that
NWF101	6B	a	1	uh huh yes 
NWF101	6B	o	1	yes
NWF101	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF101	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF101	6B	r	1	mm 
NWF101	6B	o	1	maybe that we'll hafta decide that later
NWF101	6B	a	2	oh where are the girls
NWF101	6B	i	2	oh where are the girls
NWF101	6B	a	1	okay 
NWF101	6B	c	1	just to make a s tatement
NWF101	6B	c	1	it's prob 
NWF101	6B	c	1	is that one of the more expensive things
NWF101	6B	s	1	is that one of the more expensive things
NWF101	6B	c	1	so maybe we're keeping it at the minimum
NWF101	6B	o	1	probably
NWF101	6B	c	1	we probably need that
NWF101	6B	a	1	kay
NWF101	6B	a	1	we probably do
NWF101	6B	o	2	so we're going to cut boys basketball 
NWF101	6B	c	2	to make a statement
NWF101	6B	o	1	oh i would say
NWF101	6B	f	1	oh i would say
NWF101	6B	o	1	community news ads
NWF101	6B	f	1	community news ads
NWF101	6B	c	1	cuz i don't
NWF101	6B	c	1	totally know what that is
NWF101	6B	o	1	i'd say we cut it
NWF101	6B	s	1	teaching certificates 
NWF101	6B	o	1	yes 
NWF101	6B	s	1	speed limit signs
NWF101	6B	t	1	we don't 
NWF101	6B	t	1	kay we
NWF101	6B	i	2	oh 
NWF101	6B	c	2	we might be we might be increasing the stops 
NWF101	6B	o	2	so let's keep that
NWF101	6B	o	2	i think our transportation actually runs really well right now
NWF101	6B	o	2	we may not need the extra ones we'll hafta see
NWF101	6B	c	2	we may not need the extra ones we'll hafta see
NWF101	6B	a	2	that doesn't seem like it should fall under our umbrella
NWF101	6B	c	2	that doesn't seem like it should fall under our umbrella
NWF101	6B	e	1	that's actually a good point
NWF101	6B	a	1	okay
NWF101	6B	a	1	yes
NWF101	6B	o	1	i'd say yeah
NWF101	6B	t	2	that's tough
NWF101	6B	t	2	because we don't know where we are in the process
NWF101	6B	c	2	because we don't know where we are in the process
NWF101	6B	o	1	probably
NWF101	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF101	6B	d	1	but we want that 
NWF101	6B	c	1	so things don't get outta control
NWF101	6B	c	1	like the tattooing
NWF101	6B	a	1	yeah might fall into another
NWF101	6B	c	1	yeah might fall into another
NWF101	6B	a	1	rural area
NWF101	6B	c	1	rural area
NWF101	6B	o	1	we'll come back to that one
NWF101	6B	a	1	okay 
NWF101	6B	o	1	that'll be on our list then 
NWF101	6B	t	1	this one's tough this one's a little more tough
NWF101	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF101	6B	a	1	yeah
NWF101	6B	o	2	that kinda falls under the other ones 
NWF101	6B	c	2	that kinda falls under the other ones 
NWF101	6B	c	2	i can see why they put it in there like tattoo artists and teaching 
NWF101	6B	o	2	but i think massage is different
NWF101	6B	c	2	but i think massage is different
NWF101	6B	o	1	we probably don't need to do that either
NWF101	6B	c	1	we probably don't need to do that either
NWF101	6B	b	0	yeah
NWF101	6B	a	2	okay yeah 
NWF101	6B	o	2	that'll help
NWF101	6B	a	2	yeah that's true 
NWF101	6B	t	2	it's hard to know if we're implementing these or if we're just
NWF101	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF101	6B	o	1	yes
NWF101	6B	a	1	yes
NWF101	6B	o	1	yes
NWF101	6B	o	2	and then the other one that i think was the most obvious was the towing services
NWF101	6B	t	2	the other ones were a little bit harder
NWF101	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF101	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF101	6B	d	2	no that 
NWF101	6B	c	2	we had three on our list 
NWF101	6B	f	2	potentially
NWF101	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWF101	6B	c	2	cuz we cuz we were supportive of the arts
NWF101	6B	t	2	cuz we cuz we were supportive of the arts
NWF101	6B	a	1	yeah we could do that
NWF101	6B	o	2	i think we're good on cutting two
NWF101	6B	a	1	yeah i think so too
NWF101	6B	t	2	i think they're all very justified
NWM061	3I	o	1	i'm thinking
NWM061	3I	o	1	i would put them in uh an area with other canned items
NWM061	3I	a	1	of food
NWM061	3I	o	2	on the other hand i'm not sure i would put them right with the pet food
NWM061	3I	c	2	on the other hand i'm not sure i would put them right with the pet food
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM061	3I	c	1	well in that case
NWM061	3I	o	1	i'll
NWM061	3I	c	1	none of these are really
NWM061	3I	c	1	canned but
NWM061	3I	o	2	i'm thinking maybe more with the soybeans 
NWM061	3I	c	2	things that are not fresh foods they're packaged in some way that are not open
NWM061	3I	f	1	i guess 
NWM061	3I	c	1	kind of a housewares item for starting fires and things
NWM061	3I	o	1	s thinking
NWM061	3I	o	1	more the left column with either sporting traveling or houseware type items 
NWM061	3I	f	1	maybe with
NWM061	3I	o	1	maybe with
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM061	3I	c	1	well kind of a storage thing for filling up
NWM061	3I	c	1	basements or
NWM061	3I	c	1	disaster preparedness areas
NWM061	3I	o	1	perhaps 
NWM061	3I	c	1	of course you can use them in the kitchen as well
NWM061	3I	o	1	so it'd either be a housewares item or
NWM061	3I	o	1	a kitchen item
NWM061	3I	s	1	what do you think
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM061	3I	r	1	yeah
NWM061	3I	o	1	perhaps
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah boating supplies
NWM061	3I	o	1	you get to pick a few
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWM061	3I	o	1	perhaps near the eggs 
NWM061	3I	c	1	ma
NWM061	3I	c	1	sandwiches for breakfast with them
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah yeah
NWM061	3I	a	1	personal care definitely
NWM061	3I	a	1	yes 
NWM061	3I	c	1	they're reading reading s items
NWM061	3I	o	2	so with the cans of peas and so on 
NWM061	3I	s	2	so with the cans of peas and so on 
NWM061	3I	c	2	cuz on cases
NWM061	3I	c	1	would we want to store those or eat them sooner
NWM061	3I	s	1	would we want to store those or eat them sooner
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM061	3I	a	1	that sounds good to me
NWM061	3I	c	1	that's a house supply 
NWM061	3I	o	1	i guess with the power cords maybe
NWM061	3I	s	1	i guess with the power cords maybe
NWM061	3I	c	1	travel gear 
NWM061	3I	o	1	perhaps with the travel guides
NWM061	3I	s	1	perhaps with the travel guides
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah think so
NWM061	3I	c	1	house supply kind of thing
NWM061	3I	o	1	perhaps with the siding
NWM061	3I	s	1	perhaps with the siding
NWM061	3I	c	2	something for the bathroom 
NWM061	3I	o	2	maybe with the toothpaste
NWM061	3I	s	2	maybe with the toothpaste
NWM061	3I	a	1	yes
NWM061	3I	o	2	perhaps with the backpacks and other travel supplies 
NWM061	3I	s	2	perhaps with the backpacks and other travel supplies 
NWM061	3I	o	2	or else the bundles of sticks one of the two
NWM061	3I	a	1	yes
NWM061	3I	a	1	definitely
NWM061	3I	o	1	perhaps with the uh other things that we're storing
NWM061	3I	c	2	unless these are meant for the kitchen
NWM061	3I	o	2	so i'm thinking either kitchen or with the s things we're storing in the basement
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM061	3I	o	1	makes me think of the bathroom
NWM061	3I	c	1	makes me think of the bathroom
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM061	3I	a	2	egg 
NWM061	3I	r	2	well the soybeans
NWM061	3I	o	2	well the soybeans

NWM061	3I	a	1	yes definitely
NWM061	3I	a	1	yep that's what i'd do
NWM061	3I	c	1	makes me think of household projects
NWM061	3I	o	1	along with the duct tape and power cords and box knives
NWM061	3I	s	1	along with the duct tape and power cords and box knives
NWM061	3I	a	1	yeah

NWM061	3I	c	2	but
NWM061	3I	c	2	lots of them 
NWM061	3I	o	2	maybe for storage 
NWM061	3I	s	2	what do you think

NWM061	3I	c	2	something else for the home
NWM061	3I	c	1	or for domestic 
NWM061	3I	o	1	well we could put it with the other clothing items

NWM060	3I	c	1	it looks like the third column is just food everything else is
NWM060	3I	c	1	other stuff
NWM060	3I	a	1	okay
NWM060	3I	a	2	yeah yeah probably 
NWM060	3I	o	2	maybe even the top where the boating supplies are like outdoor stuff
NWM060	3I	r	1	mm
NWM060	3I	o	1	i'd probably store them by the mousetraps
NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah maybe up by the boating supplies too yeah
NWM060	3I	o	1	yeah maybe up by the boating supplies too yeah
NWM060	3I	o	0	stay on the right side
NWM060	3I	o	1	i'm presuming we probably put those with food
NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably more like toilet paper
NWM060	3I	c	1	bathroom stuff
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably maybe by travel guides

NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah that sounds reasonable
NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably going with the power cords and duct tape i would imagine
NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM060	3I	c	0	it's close to both
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably with duct tape again maybe
NWM060	3I	s	1	probably with duct tape again maybe
NWM060	3I	a	0	right
NWM060	3I	r	2	mm i don't know 
NWM060	3I	o	2	maybe with refrigerator magnets 
NWM060	3I	c	2	i mean maybe that's
NWM060	3I	c	2	place for fridge or uh kitchen stuff
NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah probably
NWM060	3I	r	1	mm 
NWM060	3I	o	1	i'd probably throw it with the cake mix
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably go with by the eggs 
NWM060	3I	f	1	i'm presuming
NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM060	3I	r	1	yeah
NWM060	3I	a	2	oh yeah 
NWM060	3I	c	2	cuz it's a vegetable 
NWM060	3I	a	2	yeah yeah
NWM060	3I	o	1	that's probably outdoor stuff
NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably same fi same deal travel
NWM060	3I	o	1	going outside
NWM060	3I	r	2	yeah 
NWM060	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWM060	3I	o	2	or the fridge magnets or
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably by the figs and oatmeal 
NWM060	3I	f	1	maybe
NWM060	3I	r	2	mm
NWM060	3I	o	2	maybe on the side where ice cream is
NWM060	3I	o	2	i'm presuming they probably go by the chocolate bars and the ice cream
NWM060	3I	o	1	maybe down by the eggs and bagels
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably up by the boating supplies and sticks
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably by the heavy coats and vests
NWM060	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWM060	3I	o	2	or the jugs and buckets 
NWM060	3I	f	2	i mean they're all kinda close together though 
NWM060	3I	c	2	i mean they're all kinda close together though 
NWM060	3I	f	2	doesn't really matter
NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM060	3I	r	1	mm 
NWM060	3I	o	1	maybe where the cases of whiskey are
NWM060	3I	o	1	yeah don't really have any 
NWM060	3I	f	1	i guess 
NWM060	3I	c	1	there's books 
NWM060	3I	o	1	we could put it by that 
NWM060	3I	f	1	maybe
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably down there where the juice was
NWM060	3I	o	1	presumably where the paper and books are
NWM060	3I	a	2	yeah 
NWM060	3I	o	2	or the boating supplies there yeah
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably up with the jackets and sweaters
NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably with the
NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM060	3I	o	2	i'd say that probably gonna go where like where pet food's gonna go 
NWM060	3I	c	2	maybe just like garage storage
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably where the buckets and jugs are
NWM060	3I	o	2	probably where the toys are maybe like the activities room or something
NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM060	3I	r	2	mm probably 
NWM060	3I	d	2	put it down with the axes and power cords
NWM060	3I	o	2	put it down with the axes and power cords
NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWM060	3I	f	1	probably
NWM060	3I	o	2	alright let's do all four 
NWM060	3I	t	2	alright let's do all four 
NWM060	3I	e	2	go crazy
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably go with the boating supplies
NWM060	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably up with shoelaces and boots and so on
NWM060	3I	o	1	probably with heavy cable and buckets and
NWM060	3I	a	0	yeah
NWM061	6B	o	1	i'm thinking the easiest thing to do is to of
NWM061	6B	o	1	look for the weak spot in each column look for the one thing that stands out as the most i 
NWM061	6B	f	1	mean even though everything's important
NWM061	6B	o	1	football equipment
NWM061	6B	s	1	football equipment
NWM061	6B	o	1	or cooking classes
NWM061	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM061	6B	o	1	i'm i'm thinking
NWM061	6B	c	2	in my mind the things that you can learn yourself at home
NWM061	6B	c	2	pretty easily you know through books or looking things up in the library
NWM061	6B	c	2	and the things you really can't do on your own or or at home
NWM061	6B	c	2	i'm thinking well a person can learn to cook without a home economics class
NWM061	6B	c	2	their mothers can teach them books can teach them
NWM061	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM061	6B	r	1	yeah
NWM061	6B	o	2	although i'd like to keep the juice machines in the long term 
NWM061	6B	c	2	for health reasons 
NWM061	6B	o	2	but i can see
NWM061	6B	c	2	i mean if it's if it's between those or one of the tutors you know 
NWM061	6B	o	2	f i certainly don't wanna get rid of the custodians or the math tutors for example
NWM061	6B	o	1	i'm willing to negot uh to get rid of the football equipment 
NWM061	6B	o	1	even though i know sports are a big money earner
NWM061	6B	c	1	even though i know sports are a big money earner
NWM061	6B	c	2	well
NWM061	6B	c	2	if it's a choice between the poetry books and the acting coaches 
NWM061	6B	o	2	i'd keep the coaches 
NWM061	6B	c	2	because they're actually teaching and the books are just books
NWM061	6B	a	1	yeah that's true
NWM061	6B	r	2	but 
NWM061	6B	f	2	it's 
NWM061	6B	c	2	again it's what can they substitute what can they do on their own by going to a library or something well they can read poetry on their own
NWM061	6B	o	1	can go
NWM061	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM061	6B	c	1	what would be the single most important thing 
NWM061	6B	s	1	what would be the single most important thing 
NWM061	6B	o	1	the math tutors
NWM061	6B	s	1	the math tutors
NWM061	6B	c	1	if i could only pick like what's the single highest what's the top funding list 
NWM061	6B	o	1	for me i guess it's the math tutors
NWM061	6B	o	2	also i can i can see getting rid of the notetakers 
NWM061	6B	c	2	not that i wanna leave out those who are disabled but i'm thinking they can just have a student next to them photocopy their notes
NWM061	6B	c	2	rather than having someone else in there to take notes for the disabled person they can just get a copy of another student's notes
NWM061	6B	o	2	so i'm willing to part with the notetakers as well
NWM061	6B	i	1	so 
NWM061	6B	o	1	you wanna go to the next column
NWM061	6B	s	1	you wanna go to the next column
NWM061	6B	o	2	i don't know if that's
NWM061	6B	c	2	i don't know if that's
NWM061	6B	r	2	well hm
NWM061	6B	c	2	if it gets to be really bad but i that's like if i have to
NWM061	6B	c	2	i think again i can trade off more for the hospital additions
NWM061	6B	i	2	weed control 
NWM061	6B	o	2	i i'd like to make that just the individual homeowner's responsibility an
NWM061	6B	c	2	i i'd like to make that just the individual homeowner's responsibility an
NWM061	6B	o	2	well for the public areas maybe when we have more money in the budget
NWM061	6B	c	2	well for the public areas maybe when we have more money in the budget
NWM061	6B	r	2	well for the public areas maybe when we have more money in the budget
NWM061	6B	a	1	no
NWM061	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM061	6B	c	1	on a volunteer basis
NWM061	6B	o	2	i really wanna keep the toxic waste disposal though 
NWM061	6B	c	2	we gotta keep the public safe from that stuff
NWM061	6B	c	2	job training pays off a lot in the long run
NWM061	6B	o	1	well the hospital additions we can wait on
NWM061	6B	c	1	well the hospital additions we can wait on
NWM061	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM061	6B	a	1	that's true
NWM061	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM061	6B	o	1	yeah i think we've done enough there then 
NWM061	6B	c	1	i don't want to do too much compromising when it comes to health and safety in general anyway
NWM061	6B	o	2	again the community news ads are nice 
NWM061	6B	c	2	but i can they can get their news from the radio from other sources
NWM061	6B	c	2	buy a paper
NWM061	6B	o	1	soccer league is nice
NWM061	6B	c	1	soccer league is nice
NWM061	6B	c	1	i'd rather be feeding people
NWM061	6B	a	1	mm hm 
NWM061	6B	c	1	put the money to housing assistance
NWM061	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM061	6B	o	1	i can i can part with the public access station
NWM061	6B	c	1	in order to
NWM061	6B	c	1	properly fund you know the soup kitchen and the
NWM061	6B	c	1	housing assistance and the food bank
NWM061	6B	o	2	i really want the teaching certificates 
NWM061	6B	c	2	cuz we we want good education infrastructure
NWM061	6B	o	1	the speed limit signs are important
NWM061	6B	c	1	the speed limit signs are important
NWM061	6B	o	1	safety measure
NWM061	6B	c	1	safety measure
NWM061	6B	o	2	i can definitely part with the tattoo artist licenses
NWM061	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM061	6B	o	1	i don't think we need
NWM061	6B	f	1	i don't think we need
NWM061	6B	o	1	too many
NWM061	6B	f	1	too many
NWM061	6B	o	1	towing services 
NWM061	6B	f	1	towing services 
NWM061	6B	c	1	again people can call triple a
NWM061	6B	o	1	i do want pothole maintenance
NWM061	6B	o	2	subway system i'm on the fence about 
NWM061	6B	c	2	for those who use it it's very important but we already have buses
NWM061	6B	o	2	i can definitely trade off the massage certificates and extra taxi stops
NWM061	6B	c	2	in order to have say
NWM061	6B	c	2	more bus stops
NWM061	6B	o	1	i'd rather have more bus upkeep than the fishing licenses
NWM061	6B	c	1	i'd rather have more bus upkeep than the fishing licenses
NWM061	6B	o	2	i can trade away the hunting tags 
NWM061	6B	c	2	in order to have more drainage ditches i'm just thinking of the real nuts and bolts keeping the city working stuff
NWM061	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM061	6B	o	2	the massage certificates can go
NWM061	6B	o	2	oh i would get rid of both
NWM061	6B	c	1	oh if we only get rid of three things 
NWM061	6B	a	1	okay
NWM061	6B	a	1	oh okay
NWM061	6B	o	1	the the three low end things i could definitely get rid of would be
NWM061	6B	o	1	the f taxi stops
NWM061	6B	o	1	the hunting tags and the tattoo licenses
NWM061	6B	d	3	well actually
NWM061	6B	o	3	the massage certificates are gonna go firs i'd get rid of the tattoos the massages
NWM061	6B	o	1	and
NWM061	6B	a	1	yeah th they do
NWM061	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM061	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM061	6B	c	2	it would it would depend i mean it would vary from one area to the next
NWM061	6B	c	2	more rural it would probably be
NWM061	6B	c	2	but here we don't need hunting tags so much 
NWM061	6B	o	2	so i can see of the hunting tags
NWM061	6B	o	1	and i can see getting rid of the massage certificates and then
NWM061	6B	o	2	either the fishing or the tattoos 
NWM061	6B	c	2	for where we are for the m the metropolitan area for urban areas okay we don't need the fishing licenses so much
NWM061	6B	o	2	well i'm more focused on cheaper public transit 
NWM061	6B	c	2	well i'm more focused on cheaper public transit 
NWM061	6B	c	2	it's not that i have a problem with taxi stops
NWM061	6B	r	1	uh yeah
NWM061	6B	a	1	uh yeah
NWM061	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM061	6B	c	2	and people can still get taxis at the 
NWM061	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM061	6B	c	2	and they get th they get taxis in the most important areas anyway just like they would argue well we still have the most important bus stops it's like yeah but they have more people taking buses
NWM061	6B	o	1	so i'd rather have more bus stops than more taxi stops
NWM061	6B	c	1	if i'm limited to three 
NWM061	6B	o	1	then i would probably myself
NWM061	6B	o	1	want to get rid of
NWM061	6B	o	1	oh i'd want to get rid of the hunting license the fishing licenses
NWM061	6B	o	1	and
NWM061	6B	o	1	probably the taxi stops
NWM061	6B	o	2	and the most important one to keep i think are the teaching certificates
NWM061	6B	c	1	definitely want a good teaching infrastructure
NWM060	6B	o	1	i think on education for me it would be either
NWM060	6B	o	1	uh f juice machines
NWM060	6B	r	1	yeah 
NWM060	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM060	6B	o	1	or well and acting coaches
NWM060	6B	c	2	it seems to me th th that one's a lot more longer term than just taking a cooking class and learning how to feed your own family 
NWM060	6B	o	2	so it
NWM060	6B	o	2	would seem like that's a l a lower priority
NWM060	6B	a	1	right 
NWM060	6B	o	1	so maybe if we cut both that cooking classes and the juice machines
NWM060	6B	a	1	right
NWM060	6B	a	1	oh yeah that's true
NWM060	6B	a	1	yeah nuke it 
NWM060	6B	t	1	yeah nuke it 
NWM060	6B	a	1	i'd say get rid of it
NWM060	6B	r	2	yeah 
NWM060	6B	c	2	books are pretty cheap though comparatively
NWM060	6B	o	1	football
NWM060	6B	o	1	cooking classes and juice machines 
NWM060	6B	s	1	then
NWM060	6B	r	2	mm
NWM060	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM060	6B	c	1	i don't think weed control is high priority 
NWM060	6B	o	1	i think i'd probably let them manage that themselves
NWM060	6B	c	1	i think i'd probably let them manage that themselves
NWM060	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM060	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM060	6B	a	1	yeah definitely
NWM060	6B	a	1	right
NWM060	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM060	6B	c	2	i mean that's three cuz if we do the additions and the weed control neighborhood watch support 
NWM060	6B	o	2	that's three
NWM060	6B	a	1	right right
NWM060	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM060	6B	o	2	i think my first thing to do would be to cut the stadium upkeep
NWM060	6B	a	1	right
NWM060	6B	o	2	i think i might be w
NWM060	6B	o	2	interested in that getting rid of that too 
NWM060	6B	c	2	cuz that's usually
NWM060	6B	c	2	overhead spraying and things like that that aren't optimal
NWM060	6B	a	1	right
NWM060	6B	c	1	may not be in seattle
NWM060	6B	a	1	right
NWM060	6B	a	1	right
NWM060	6B	a	1	right
NWM060	6B	s	1	so if we get three what would they be then 
NWM060	6B	o	1	maybe fishing and hunting and
NWM060	6B	d	2	over taxi stops
NWM060	6B	s	2	over taxi stops
NWM060	6B	d	2	but then that's four things
NWM060	6B	c	2	but then that's four things
NWM060	6B	c	2	well cuz we've only been doing three on the lists
NWM060	6B	c	3	right cuz that the
NWM060	6B	i	3	right cuz that the
NWM060	6B	d	2	but those 
NWM060	6B	f	2	i mean 
NWM060	6B	d	2	the flip side is that those allow people to start businesses
NWM060	6B	c	2	the flip side is that those allow people to start businesses
NWM060	6B	c	2	whereas a fishing license and a hunting tag is a much much smaller
NWM060	6B	c	2	they make money on them too but it's a much much smaller person i mean they're f
NWM060	6B	c	2	for better or for worse there's far more tattoo parlors in town than there are hunters probably
NWM060	6B	o	1	so i mean it
NWM060	6B	a	1	right
NWM060	6B	a	1	right
NWM060	6B	o	2	well what about taxi stops though
NWM060	6B	s	2	well what about taxi stops though
NWM060	6B	a	2	no 
NWM060	6B	o	2	but i mean getting rid of that instead of massage or tattoo
NWM060	6B	c	2	because those aren't really
NWM060	6B	c	2	a taxi stop is just a one more parking spot that doesn't get charged for
NWM060	6B	s	1	right
NWM060	6B	c	1	yell on the corner 
NWM060	6B	a	1	right
NWM060	6B	a	1	right
NWM060	6B	a	1	right
NWM060	6B	a	1	cool
NWM060	6B	a	1	yeah definitely
NWM062	3I	o	1	okay l why don't you go first let's see what you've got

NWM063	3I	o	0	we're down to these things again here right there
NWM062	6B	o	1	just arbitrarily say
NWM062	6B	o	1	so i wou yeah so i would i would say four 
NWM062	6B	c	1	if you took f uh just arbitrarily assuming that
NWM062	6B	c	1	i it isn't that way but ass assuming they all equally got the same amount of money
NWM062	6B	o	1	so if you made across the board cuts as often happens twenty five percent
NWM062	6B	o	1	that would mean four four items would have to be cut from each
NWM062	6B	o	1	each category
NWM062	6B	a	1	okay 
NWM062	6B	o	1	so let's go from
NWM062	6B	o	1	education and program
NWM062	6B	a	1	okay
NWM062	6B	o	1	football that's one football equipment
NWM062	6B	o	2	yeah it shou should say drama
NWM062	6B	o	1	i'm i'm assuming as opposed to someone
NWM062	6B	s	1	so would you keep a drama coach
NWM062	6B	a	1	okay
NWM062	6B	o	2	ooh i don't think you can do that
NWM062	6B	a	1	yeah right
NWM062	6B	b	2	oh no
NWM062	6B	o	2	you expect that at places like the fast food restaurants 
NWM062	6B	c	2	because they have these buttons but they don't actual i mean it's all done for them you know they don't have to
NWM062	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM062	6B	o	1	let's so let's go over the four that we
NWM062	6B	a	1	yeah i i'd agree with that
NWM062	6B	o	1	you know i'd i'd have
NWM062	6B	o	1	well let's take them in groups
NWM062	6B	o	1	so is there anything in the one two three four fi six of those six that you would get rid of
NWM062	6B	s	1	so is there anything in the one two three four fi six of those six that you would get rid of
NWM062	6B	b	1	yeah
NWM062	6B	c	2	i i think public uh reproductive education if when it's done at the county level
NWM062	6B	c	2	is providing um uh education a
NWM062	6B	c	2	at the clinics
NWM062	6B	c	1	that kind of stuff so
NWM062	6B	b	0	mm
NWM062	6B	r	2	i i'd i'd think about uh 
NWM062	6B	o	2	let's go th th 
NWM062	6B	o	2	anything else in that f first group of six
NWM062	6B	s	2	anything else in that f first group of six
NWM062	6B	a	1	okay 
NWM062	6B	o	1	needle exchange
NWM062	6B	s	1	needle exchange
NWM062	6B	c	2	well that's food inspection just food just in general
NWM062	6B	b	0	oh
NWM062	6B	c	2	nobody gets bagels
NWM062	6B	t	2	nobody gets bagels
NWM062	6B	a	2	okay shut them down shut them down
NWM062	6B	a	1	well yeah
NWM062	6B	a	1	yeah okay
NWM062	6B	o	2	that'd be a tough one to cut
NWM062	6B	a	2	okay that's three yeah i'd agree with that one
NWM062	6B	o	1	of the f three th in that group
NWM062	6B	a	1	kay let's go back up 
NWM062	6B	o	1	kay let's go back up 
NWM062	6B	o	1	let's go to the top of the list so just one more
NWM062	6B	o	1	job training
NWM062	6B	s	1	job training
NWM062	6B	r	2	boy
NWM062	6B	c	2	all the voc ed teachers i know
NWM062	6B	c	2	ah they would they would
NWM062	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM062	6B	o	2	you know i i would hate
NWM062	6B	o	1	out of that list i would go with the in in cut out the invasive species removal
NWM062	6B	b	0	yeah
NWM062	6B	b	0	yeah
NWM062	6B	a	2	you know you're yeah 
NWM062	6B	c	2	i know the there's a problem with uh walnut trees and with um
NWM062	6B	c	1	certain apple trees
NWM062	6B	c	1	and also with um
NWM062	6B	o	1	so we got we got
NWM062	6B	o	1	we got four
NWM062	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM062	6B	a	1	okay
NWM062	6B	a	1	okay
NWM062	6B	c	2	cuz you got reproductive education and maybe that would cover that
NWM062	6B	a	1	okay that's one i agree with that one
NWM062	6B	a	1	okay
NWM062	6B	b	1	right
NWM062	6B	d	2	though i isn't that uh public
NWM062	6B	c	2	though i isn't that uh public
NWM062	6B	a	1	okay
NWM062	6B	o	2	i would cut that
NWM062	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM062	6B	c	1	w actually w those are the ones that we said before 
NWM062	6B	a	1	okay
NWM062	6B	b	1	mm hm
NWM062	6B	r	0	uh
NWM062	6B	c	2	well you know th the problem is though
NWM062	6B	c	2	well i don't know how much of a problem it is now but when i was teaching
NWM062	6B	c	2	you had uh holes in your staff
NWM062	6B	c	2	and um you couldn't find someone who was qualified
NWM062	6B	c	2	in a certain ar for example to teach uh primary school
NWM062	6B	c	2	so you have upper elementary which is four through six
NWM062	6B	c	2	but you needed a teacher who uh you know uh could do kindergarten through
NWM062	6B	c	2	grade three then none of them are certif no s
NWM062	6B	c	2	certified so
NWM062	6B	c	2	as an emergency what they would do is take a teacher from
NWM062	6B	c	2	the upper grades and move them down to the lower grades 
NWM062	6B	o	2	not a good idea 
NWM062	6B	c	2	but it's done a was done all the time i think it's still being done
NWM062	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM062	6B	a	1	yep
NWM062	6B	o	2	need that right
NWM062	6B	s	2	need that right
NWM062	6B	o	1	oh we cut the bus stu
NWM062	6B	o	1	that's
NWM062	6B	o	1	that's
NWM062	6B	r	2	i was that when your car is towed though
NWM062	6B	c	2	i was that when your car is towed though
NWM062	6B	d	2	i was that when your car is towed though
NWM062	6B	d	2	well i know but they but you have uh de there is some costs
NWM062	6B	c	2	well i know but they but you have uh de there is some costs
NWM062	6B	d	2	well like al uh let's let's again this is a hypothetical
NWM062	6B	c	2	well like al uh let's let's again this is a hypothetical
NWM062	6B	c	2	if they're if uh the county is providing that
NWM062	6B	c	2	then you would have to
NWM062	6B	b	1	uh huh
NWM062	6B	s	1	so you would cut towing service
NWM062	6B	f	1	yeah i don't know enough about that one to really
NWM062	6B	c	2	i have a friend who's a massage she's a licensed therapist
NWM062	6B	c	2	she she is really if you don't regulate that what happens is it gets it gets goes sideways on you pretty fast
NWM062	6B	a	2	and taxi stops we'd can that
NWM062	6B	o	2	and taxi stops we'd can that
NWM062	6B	c	1	that's revenue
NWM062	6B	o	1	keep that and drainage ditches so i think we had four 
NWM062	6B	a	1	yeah that's four
NWM062	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM062	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM062	6B	o	2	you kn you know the reality the reality of of cutting items is that every single item on the budget
NWM062	6B	o	2	has a constituency
NWM062	6B	o	2	and and the ones that you say okay let's say it's real obvious flagpole repair
NWM062	6B	o	2	then the veteran group would come out of the woodwork and say how can you desecrate the american flag and
NWM062	6B	o	2	you know i and i mean that's how it would g uh that's how it'd go i mean you know
NWM062	6B	d	2	actually there is there i there is a there is a law about flying the flag in public buildings
NWM062	6B	c	2	actually there is there i there is a there is a law about flying the flag in public buildings
NWM062	6B	o	2	you ha i well a state law yeah i i don't th i don't think there's a federal law but there is a state law
NWM062	6B	o	2	so but if you cut it i mean if it was something you could cut
NWM062	6B	o	2	and you cut it
NWM062	6B	o	2	nobody would come after you
NWM062	6B	c	2	there there are laws out there that are not enforced all the time
NWM062	6B	c	2	look at the marijuana laws
NWM062	6B	o	2	cracks me up
NWM062	6B	c	2	okay it's legal to have what an ounce of marijuana on you right whatever it is
NWM062	6B	c	2	but it is illegal to buy it
NWM062	6B	c	2	now think about that for a second
NWM062	6B	o	2	so where are you g so
NWM062	6B	o	2	the only way 
NWM062	6B	c	2	uh and people with medical marijuana are were already covered
NWM062	6B	c	2	you know under the uh under the mar medical marijuana
NWM062	6B	c	2	so anyone who is not under that can carry um a an ounce or whatever it is of marijuana
NWM062	6B	c	2	but you can't buy it you can't legally buy 
NWM062	6B	o	2	and i just think that's really hilarious 
NWM062	6B	c	2	and they were talking about that in colorado it's the same problem
NWM062	6B	o	2	that's the problem here too
NWM062	6B	d	2	well no it's
NWM062	6B	c	2	well no it's
NWM062	6B	d	2	no it's it's bec it's not drug dealers per se what they're wh th w th w what they're uh y you can't do th the problem is because
NWM062	6B	c	2	no it's it's bec it's not drug dealers per se what they're wh th w th w what they're uh y you can't do th the problem is because
NWM062	6B	d	2	it's a controlled substance under federal
NWM062	6B	c	2	it's a controlled substance under federal
NWM062	6B	b	0	yeah
NWM062	6B	a	2	right 
NWM062	6B	c	2	it's not the m
NWM062	6B	a	2	well yeah 
NWM062	6B	o	2	an so you need to change the law at the federal level
NWM062	6B	r	2	we'll see 
NWM062	6B	r	2	we'll see 
NWM062	6B	i	2	we'll see 
NWM062	6B	o	2	you know it's gonna be interesting
NWM062	6B	d	2	yes and no 
NWM062	6B	c	2	they've uh the problem is all of the banks currently in the state of wa we've done away pretty much with state regulation
NWM062	6B	o	2	you'd have to institute a whole new set of laws
NWM062	6B	c	2	cuz all of them are you know the f i if the feds are involved f d i c insured or
NWM062	6B	c	2	uh k uh kim uh what is it credit union uh you know that's all federal regulation so if they're at all regulated by the feds in any way shape or form
NWM062	6B	o	2	they wo they won't touch it 
NWM062	6B	c	2	it was a bank uh th in uh seattle
NWM062	6B	c	2	that was willing you know the bank president said our board they're they're willing to be the bank and then they reneged about a week later they said no we can't do it because of the c controlled substance for the federal we would lose our license an
NWM062	6B	o	3	of course they did
NWM062	6B	c	3	they th that was one o yeah that was one of the that was one of the basic issues in the campaign you know uh i mean against it was
NWM062	6B	c	1	was that um you know it's a violation of the federal law
NWM062	6B	c	1	then we went ahead and did it anyway
NWM062	6B	o	2	yeah it's regulation by the state
NWM062	6B	c	2	but you know the problem is like the they were saying in colora oh it's true in this state too but they they uh you know
NWM062	6B	c	2	y you pay your your employee
NWM062	6B	c	2	and you're gonna pay them uh six hundred dollars it's a it's all cash
NWM062	6B	o	3	that's crazy
NWM062	6B	o	3	that is so crazy
NWM063	6B	o	1	the list that i figure is the least important is the one i wanna get the number from
NWM063	6B	o	2	which is recreation and public services
NWM063	6B	o	1	i think
NWM063	6B	a	1	okay
NWM063	6B	a	1	okay 
NWM063	6B	o	1	so let's cut four
NWM063	6B	c	2	well that's that's that's a borderline 
NWM063	6B	o	2	we'll see what happens with the rest of it
NWM063	6B	c	2	that's also borderline 
NWM063	6B	o	2	see what happens with the rest of it
NWM063	6B	o	1	keep it
NWM063	6B	o	1	keep them
NWM063	6B	o	1	cut it
NWM063	6B	o	1	cut
NWM063	6B	o	1	cut it
NWM063	6B	c	1	the uh the alumni will pay for it
NWM063	6B	a	1	yes drama coaches yes
NWM063	6B	a	1	that's what i'm a yeah
NWM063	6B	o	1	uh yes i believe i would 
NWM063	6B	c	1	we got two gone already don't we
NWM063	6B	o	1	yeah we keep them
NWM063	6B	o	1	keep them
NWM063	6B	o	1	can them
NWM063	6B	a	1	i don't think so either
NWM063	6B	o	2	we can can those 
NWM063	6B	c	2	we talked about that 
NWM063	6B	o	2	yeah let's get rid of those 
NWM063	6B	c	2	because they don't make any money
NWM063	6B	c	2	i think in today's world uh with uh the number of kids that can't count
NWM063	6B	c	2	that are out there wandering around now i had a bank teller who couldn't count by the way about three weeks ago yeah i had to tell her tell her she can't count
NWM063	6B	b	1	yeah
NWM063	6B	b	1	yeah
NWM063	6B	c	2	and that's what they s that's what they thought in the think in the bank too but when they're sitting there and they actually counting money in front of you
NWM063	6B	o	2	you know that's when it gets that's when it gets tense
NWM063	6B	a	1	yeah okay
NWM063	6B	a	1	okay
NWM063	6B	o	2	i don't think we can remove any of those actually reproductive education i'd put on the line 
NWM063	6B	c	2	because it's it's it's it's not necessary
NWM063	6B	c	2	to uh
NWM063	6B	c	2	immediate
NWM063	6B	c	2	the uh the immediate lack of a lack of that won't affect the public health
NWM063	6B	a	2	yeah that's it 
NWM063	6B	d	2	but i think it's uh you know basically it's it's one of those things where if we don't have it it's not going to really affect the public health and safety immediately
NWM063	6B	c	2	but i think it's uh you know basically it's it's one of those things where if we don't have it it's not going to really affect the public health and safety immediately
NWM063	6B	b	1	yeah 
NWM063	6B	f	1	that's just a on the list 
NWM063	6B	o	1	no nothing else
NWM063	6B	o	2	okay we'd ha probably have to 
NWM063	6B	c	2	if we have to make cuts and they're spending too much money 
NWM063	6B	o	2	bagel factory inspections
NWM063	6B	c	2	what do we need bagel factory inspections for
NWM063	6B	b	1	yeah
NWM063	6B	d	2	well j no just bagel factories it's obviously what it says so that must be what it is
NWM063	6B	c	2	well j no just bagel factories it's obviously what it says so that must be what it is
NWM063	6B	o	2	so can that
NWM063	6B	a	2	i know 
NWM063	6B	t	2	i know 
NWM063	6B	x	2	well 
NWM063	6B	a	2	yeah yeah 
NWM063	6B	c	2	well the thing is the thing is is when you when you make a bagel what are you making you know cooked bread
NWM063	6B	c	2	how you gonna screw that up

NWM008	3I	o	1	it can sort of in this area
NWM008	3I	a	1	generally

NWM008	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWM008	3I	c	1	it's sort of like like sort of camping travel
NWM008	3I	c	2	and usually in a grocery store like the bottled water's in it's own area
NWM008	3I	a	1	yeah

NWM008	3I	c	2	i think this is like the sugary
NWM008	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM008	3I	d	2	i'm thinking maybe by soybeans
NWM008	3I	o	2	i'm thinking maybe by soybeans

NWM064	6B	o	1	pothole maintenance was probably good to keep 
NWM064	6B	o	1	about massage certificates
NWM064	6B	s	1	about massage certificates
NWM064	6B	d	2	tattoo artist license might be a bit more um useful if only because
NWM064	6B	c	2	tattoo artist license might be a bit more um useful if only because
NWM064	6B	d	2	you're cutting something into somebody's skin
NWM064	6B	c	2	you're cutting something into somebody's skin
NWM064	6B	a	2	yeah it's better to ha to
NWM064	6B	o	2	yeah it's better to ha to
NWM064	6B	c	2	than having an unlicensed tattoo artist
NWM064	6B	a	1	mm hm
NWM064	6B	a	1	alright
NWM008	6B	o	1	so let's start with educations and programs
NWM008	6B	d	2	well
NWM008	6B	c	2	those are both good things
NWM008	6B	r	2	maybe 
NWM008	6B	d	2	i mean i think bookkeeping classes you know that's important that's basically accounting that's teaching people how to manage their money that's good for the community
NWM008	6B	c	2	i mean i think bookkeeping classes you know that's important that's basically accounting that's teaching people how to manage their money that's good for the community
NWM008	6B	a	1	yeah those could probably go
NWM008	6B	c	1	i mean
NWM008	6B	c	2	our kids are gonna be fat no matter what
NWM008	6B	o	1	alright what uh let's see i think we hafta
NWM008	6B	a	1	cut sugar free alright
NWM008	6B	o	1	uh maybe c we could cut acting coaches
NWM008	6B	s	1	uh maybe c we could cut acting coaches
NWM008	6B	c	1	that seems like something that people could do privately
NWM008	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM008	6B	o	1	see poetry books could probably also go
NWM008	6B	a	1	okay 
NWM008	6B	c	1	i mean yeah i
NWM008	6B	o	1	assistant cooks
NWM008	6B	o	1	i think that could probably go
NWM008	6B	o	1	i would say keep math tutors
NWM008	6B	o	2	definitely keep sex ed
NWM008	6B	o	1	keep custodians speech therapy
NWM008	6B	o	1	uh special ed teachers definitely keep
NWM008	6B	o	1	keep
NWM008	6B	o	1	i would say keep music teachers you know 
NWM008	6B	c	1	art's important
NWM008	6B	t	1	alright three things we can do this
NWM008	6B	d	2	i mea it's the same as sex ed isn't it
NWM008	6B	c	2	i mea it's the same as sex ed isn't it
NWM008	6B	s	2	i mea it's the same as sex ed isn't it
NWM008	6B	c	2	but it can't hurt to have two honestly
NWM008	6B	a	2	oh okay this is for adults
NWM008	6B	c	2	oh okay this is for adults
NWM008	6B	a	1	yeah okay fair enough fair enough
NWM008	6B	o	2	we should definitely keep should probably keep
NWM008	6B	o	2	we should definitely keep toxic waste disposal
NWM008	6B	o	1	uh hospital additions
NWM008	6B	s	1	uh hospital additions
NWM008	6B	o	2	well le let's c let's come back to that one i think we can get rid of the bagel factory inspections
NWM008	6B	c	2	just cuz
NWM008	6B	c	2	if it was like factory inspections in general we should keep that but specific to bagel factories seems like a weird targeted almost anti semitic
NWM008	6B	c	2	government thing to be funding
NWM008	6B	c	2	just there's more food than bagels
NWM008	6B	o	2	uh i would say keep needle exchange
NWM008	6B	o	2	uh d keep the sex offender database
NWM008	6B	o	1	keep veterans medical assistance
NWM008	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM008	6B	o	2	like say we're d we're dumping bagel factory inspections and weed control
NWM008	6B	o	1	egg farms regulations
NWM008	6B	s	1	egg farms regulations
NWM008	6B	c	2	i don't know what those are 
NWM008	6B	o	2	but i mean it probably wouldn't hurt to keep them
NWM008	6B	c	2	but i mean it probably wouldn't hurt to keep them
NWM008	6B	c	2	that's people's food
NWM008	6B	o	1	i would say yeah keep that 
NWM008	6B	c	1	it's a public health
NWM008	6B	o	2	i would get rid of neighborhood watch support
NWM008	6B	c	2	presumably you already have police
NWM008	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM008	6B	d	2	but neighborhood watch support i feel a lot of time is just people spying on their neighbors
NWM008	6B	c	2	but neighborhood watch support i feel a lot of time is just people spying on their neighbors
NWM008	6B	o	1	okay so is that three
NWM008	6B	o	1	let's just do a quick scan see if anything can just go from like the get go
NWM008	6B	o	1	i like most of these
NWM008	6B	r	2	i i i 
NWM008	6B	a	2	i would be with you on the football stadium upkeep 
NWM008	6B	c	2	just cuz it already exists 
NWM008	6B	d	2	but i wouldn't wanna cut the sports clubs
NWM008	6B	o	1	i think maybe kitty an kitten and puppy adoption could be he done by a private charity
NWM008	6B	c	1	i think maybe kitty an kitten and puppy adoption could be he done by a private charity
NWM008	6B	o	1	doesn't necessarily need to be run by the city
NWM008	6B	c	1	doesn't necessarily need to be run by the city
NWM008	6B	o	2	definitely keep housing assistance and soup kitchens and food banks
NWM008	6B	d	2	so if we have a public news station i'm not sure if we need a public access station
NWM008	6B	c	2	so if we have a public news station i'm not sure if we need a public access station
NWM008	6B	s	2	so if we have a public news station i'm not sure if we need a public access station
NWM008	6B	d	2	well
NWM008	6B	o	2	i'm for that personally 
NWM008	6B	c	2	but that's cuz i used to live in seoul that has a huge stray cat problem
NWM008	6B	o	2	and i'm very much in favor of getting rid of like more stray cats
NWM008	6B	c	2	i don't want them to keep making more
NWM008	6B	c	2	like those things are loud
NWM008	6B	c	2	and they're gross
NWM008	6B	o	1	alright so b wha so we got football stadium upkeep
NWM008	6B	o	1	uh kitten and puppy adoption
NWM008	6B	o	2	i i my vote is public access if we already have public news 
NWM008	6B	c	2	i i my vote is public access if we already have public news 
NWM008	6B	c	2	i've seen the public access channel it's a lot of weird stuff that is not particularly helpful
NWM008	6B	c	2	i don't remember the number but it's just like a bunch of people can get on have their own shows there's one guy who's been running a kurt cobain was murdered show for like ten years now and it's it's funny but it's not
NWM008	6B	o	2	if it was keep that or keep p b s i'm keeping p b s every single time
NWM008	6B	c	2	if it was keep that or keep p b s i'm keeping p b s every single time
NWM008	6B	o	2	it's not hard to do
NWM008	6B	c	2	it's not hard to do
NWM008	6B	a	2	okay it was har it was hard to do then back then it was good
NWM008	6B	o	2	okay it was har it was hard to do then back then it was good
NWM008	6B	c	2	okay it was har it was hard to do then back then it was good
NWM008	6B	b	0	mm hm
NWM008	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM008	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM008	6B	o	1	maybe flagpole repair
NWM008	6B	s	1	maybe flagpole repair
NWM008	6B	o	1	we could cut some space there
NWM008	6B	o	1	they seem pretty tough
NWM008	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM008	6B	c	1	i mean i guess you c you can these days you just call a taxi
NWM008	6B	d	2	naw i would keep 
NWM008	6B	c	2	i mean if you've ever been to spokane you wanna know about keeping pothole maintenance
NWM008	6B	c	2	they di they got rid of that and it's a nightmare
NWM008	6B	o	1	maybe 
NWM008	6B	a	1	yeah i was gonna say that or more tattoo artist licenses
NWM008	6B	o	1	yeah i was gonna say that or more tattoo artist licenses
NWM008	6B	a	1	yeah i guess they should be licensed
NWM008	6B	o	1	and not just random folks
NWM008	6B	c	2	i'd say if you're having an unlicensed masseuse it's less dangerous 
NWM008	6B	e	2	that's a good point
NWM008	6B	a	1	alright yeah 
NWM008	6B	o	1	so i say we cut massage uh flagpole and taxi stops all there right in a row
NWM008	6B	o	1	budget solved
NWM068	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWM068	3I	a	1	th i that makes sense
NWM068	3I	c	1	th i that makes sense
NWM068	3I	o	1	i would think 
NWM068	3I	f	1	maybe by siding boating supplies 
NWM068	3I	o	1	maybe by siding boating supplies 
NWM068	3I	o	1	so think there
NWM068	3I	s	1	so think there

NWM068	3I	c	1	but it's it's kind of a different
NWM068	3I	o	1	maybe it would fall s somewhere in between

NWM068	3I	o	1	could either 
NWM068	3I	f	1	could either 
NWM068	3I	c	1	i would think

NWM068	3I	c	1	by some of the dry foods 
NWM068	3I	o	1	by some of the dry foods 
NWM068	3I	o	1	or like up

NWM068	3I	o	1	which i'd put more up towards like a sweet
NWM068	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM068	3I	a	1	seems good
NWM068	3I	o	1	this looks like uh aisle one
NWM068	3I	o	1	maybe by the bundles of sticks
NWM068	3I	s	1	maybe by the bundles of sticks
NWM068	3I	a	1	yeah yeah
NWM068	3I	a	1	makes sense
NWM068	3I	c	1	makes sense
NWM068	3I	o	1	maybe above soybeans
NWM068	3I	s	1	maybe above soybeans
NWM068	3I	s	1	should we put them next to our
NWM068	3I	o	1	should we put them next to our
NWM068	3I	t	2	ah that's the trick
NWM068	3I	o	1	maybe let's say fresh 
NWM068	3I	c	1	since they don't say 
NWM068	3I	o	1	so
NWM068	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWM068	3I	o	1	maybe here

NWM068	3I	o	1	miscellaneous item
NWM068	3I	x	2	wow
NWM068	3I	o	2	the two places i'm seeing that would make the most sense in my head would be down here 
NWM068	3I	c	2	the two places i'm seeing that would make the most sense in my head would be down here 
NWM068	3I	o	2	or by these
NWM068	3I	o	2	items
NWM068	3I	a	1	okay
NWM068	3I	a	1	yeah 
NWM068	3I	o	1	okay let's see
NWM068	3I	s	1	what do you think
NWM068	3I	a	1	down 
NWM068	3I	s	1	down 
NWM068	3I	a	1	kay
NWM068	3I	o	1	now we have choices so
NWM068	3I	o	1	i could we could put it by our scissors
NWM068	3I	c	1	that would probably make the m make sense
NWM068	3I	o	1	canned food
NWM068	3I	r	1	i guess they aren't
NWM068	3I	s	1	down here
NWM068	3I	o	1	down here
NWM068	3I	a	1	okay
NWM068	3I	o	1	let's do that
NWM068	3I	a	1	let's do that
NWM068	3I	o	1	lots of options on this one
NWM068	3I	s	1	what are you thinking
NWM068	3I	f	1	possibly like in this area
NWM068	3I	s	1	possibly like in this area
NWM068	3I	o	1	possibly like in this area
NWM068	3I	f	1	course then we have all like our
NWM068	3I	c	1	course then we have all like our
NWM068	3I	f	1	food and
NWM068	3I	c	1	food and
NWM068	3I	c	1	we'll have different types of like i i'm assuming we'll have the juice and
NWM068	3I	o	1	this'll probably go together
NWM068	3I	o	2	this is turning into an awesome store
NWM068	3I	t	2	this is turning into an awesome store
NWM068	3I	o	2	actually could almost go over here too
NWM068	3I	s	1	how bout right above empty plastic jugs
NWM068	3I	o	1	how bout right above empty plastic jugs
NWM068	3I	o	1	well we've got
NWM068	3I	c	1	well we've got
NWM068	3I	o	1	we've got some like
NWM068	3I	c	1	we've got some like
NWM068	3I	f	1	so it could go maybe in this area 
NWM068	3I	o	1	so it could go maybe in this area 
NWM068	3I	o	1	or by the boating supplies and fishing net
NWM068	3I	s	1	or by the boating supplies and fishing net
NWM068	3I	c	1	could use buckets for that 
NWM068	3I	s	1	yeah

NWM068	3I	f	1	um let's see i guess there
NWM068	3I	o	1	um let's see i guess there
NWM068	3I	o	1	it has to go over there again 
NWM068	3I	f	1	i i would think
NWM068	3I	f	1	i don't know 
NWM068	3I	o	1	maybe maybe by like some of these items 
NWM068	3I	f	1	maybe maybe by like some of these items 
NWM068	3I	c	1	like we have our
NWM068	3I	c	1	like w work out items
NWM068	3I	a	2	boating

NWM068	3I	s	1	could do it up at the very top
NWM068	3I	x	2	oh no
NWM068	3I	t	2	this is a space right
NWM068	3I	o	2	well i guess it could go like under tow
NWM068	3I	o	2	ropes or by the axes or whatever
NWM068	3I	a	1	yeah
NWM068	3I	x	1	oh man 
NWM068	3I	s	1	do we use it in our last little
NWM068	3I	o	1	do we use it in our last little
NWM068	3I	s	1	space right here
NWM068	3I	o	1	space right here
NWM068	3I	s	1	or would it be okay to put our socks down somewhere else

NWM068	3I	c	2	certainly depends on what type of flag they are
NWM068	3I	c	1	like having that makes me think it has to do something with like a wave down flag or
NWM068	3I	c	1	not like a national flag 
NWM068	3I	f	1	but who knows
NWM068	3I	o	1	could be

NWM068	6B	f	1	possibly
NWM068	6B	o	1	like on the fence maybe with that one
NWM068	6B	f	1	like on the fence maybe with that one
NWM068	6B	s	1	like on the fence maybe with that one
NWM068	6B	o	1	that seems kind of important
NWM068	6B	f	1	i don't know maybe
NWM068	6B	a	1	good point good point
NWM068	6B	a	1	okay so probably not with that one
NWM068	6B	o	1	that's that seems like it might be a good program to have
NWM068	6B	s	1	you think so too
NWM068	6B	r	1	actually
NWM068	6B	a	1	i guess it depends on what it is like how harmful it is
NWM068	6B	c	1	i guess it depends on what it is like how harmful it is
NWM068	6B	c	0	i'm going extreme in my head
NWM068	6B	c	1	like it's gonna
NWM068	6B	c	1	mess with the population 
NWM068	6B	d	1	but if it was something more like
NWM068	6B	c	1	but if it was something more like
NWM068	6B	c	1	like a certain species of bees
NWM068	6B	c	1	or something that's not really going to effect lives then
NWM068	6B	o	1	so possibly
NWM068	6B	s	1	so possibly
NWM068	6B	o	1	yeah
NWM068	6B	o	1	it's a maybe again
NWM068	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM068	6B	s	1	right
NWM068	6B	o	1	uh yeah 
NWM068	6B	c	1	that that seems
NWM068	6B	c	2	like a 
NWM068	6B	o	2	okay so definitely that one
NWM068	6B	o	1	i don't think so
NWM068	6B	o	1	i don't know about that one
NWM068	6B	a	1	right 
NWM068	6B	o	1	it's probably only that one
NWM068	6B	o	2	it's seems like a good service 
NWM068	6B	o	2	but it also seems kinda like um
NWM068	6B	c	2	but it also seems kinda like um
NWM068	6B	o	2	it's very dependent on like
NWM068	6B	o	2	it's almost like a l i don't want to call it a luxury but it's kinda like a luxury service to have 
NWM068	6B	c	2	it's almost like a l i don't want to call it a luxury but it's kinda like a luxury service to have 
NWM068	6B	c	2	like if you've got all your bases covered and you have extra 
NWM068	6B	o	2	like if you've got all your bases covered and you have extra 
NWM068	6B	o	2	money have a needle
NWM068	6B	a	1	i think so too 
NWM068	6B	c	1	take care of take care of
NWM068	6B	x	0	uh
NWM068	6B	o	1	yeah i don't know about that one
NWM068	6B	f	1	i guess 
NWM068	6B	c	1	don't know how harmful like having weeds grow up on the side of the road could be 
NWM068	6B	s	1	you know 
NWM068	6B	o	1	probably not
NWM068	6B	s	1	probably not
NWM068	6B	o	1	ma may i'm maybe we should think that way 
NWM068	6B	c	1	cuz it seems like a luxury type of thing
NWM068	6B	a	1	yeah okay
NWM068	6B	f	1	i don't know
NWM068	6B	f	1	uh 
NWM068	6B	o	1	it seems like it
NWM068	6B	o	1	e it seems like uh a little extra too like some of the like hospital additions and toxic waste dispose waste disposal seem pretty straight forward but
NWM068	6B	o	1	okay so we'll keep
NWM068	6B	o	1	and then we have three more to keep
NWM068	6B	a	1	yeah 
NWM068	6B	c	1	job training seems good
NWM068	6B	c	1	which of these is better than the others
NWM068	6B	o	1	which of these is better than the others
NWM068	6B	o	1	i'd say maybe
NWM068	6B	f	1	i'd say maybe
NWM068	6B	o	1	chicken pox seem now that i think of it seems a little bit like uh don't need that one
NWM068	6B	o	1	maybe reproductive education
NWM068	6B	d	1	then again that could fall under the other category
NWM068	6B	o	1	then again that could fall under the other category
NWM068	6B	o	1	maybe we should just pick two
NWM068	6B	o	1	i would say like between prenatal and reproductive one of the two
NWM068	6B	o	1	if either
NWM068	6B	o	1	maybe prenatal check ups
NWM068	6B	o	1	how bout 
NWM068	6B	s	1	how bout 
NWM068	6B	s	1	what do you think for the other one
NWM068	6B	o	1	s t d education
NWM068	6B	s	1	s t d education
NWM068	6B	a	1	okay okay
NWM068	6B	f	1	i don't know 
NWM068	6B	o	1	it doesn't seem like it would be that big of a problem
NWM068	6B	c	1	it doesn't seem like it would be that big of a problem
NWM068	6B	o	1	could be like
NWM068	6B	c	1	i've never seen cats get too outta control
NWM068	6B	s	1	you know what i mean 
NWM068	6B	f	1	maybe
NWM068	6B	o	1	yeah like that id 
NWM068	6B	s	1	seem good
NWM068	6B	o	1	i like the idea of a food bank
NWM068	6B	o	1	possibly
NWM068	6B	f	1	possibly
NWM068	6B	o	1	it's nice to have like services for kids in a community 
NWM068	6B	c	1	it's nice to have like services for kids in a community 
NWM068	6B	d	1	but
NWM068	6B	o	1	could be a luxury
NWM068	6B	c	1	could be a luxury
NWM068	6B	c	1	i tend to like
NWM068	6B	c	2	i tend to like favor humans over animals 
NWM068	6B	o	2	if it came d down to it i'd probably choose the soccer league over that
NWM068	6B	o	1	maybe neither
NWM068	6B	s	1	what do you think
NWM068	6B	a	2	yeah 
NWM068	6B	o	2	definitely 
NWM068	6B	s	2	housing assistance 
NWM068	6B	a	2	okay yeah that's a good one 
NWM068	6B	s	2	dog catcher
NWM068	6B	f	1	i don't know
NWM068	6B	o	2	it seems kinda unnecessary
NWM068	6B	o	1	skip it and come back
NWM068	6B	s	1	skip it and come back
NWM068	6B	f	1	um maybe
NWM068	6B	s	1	um maybe
NWM068	6B	c	1	kinda falls into the soccer league category
NWM068	6B	o	1	kinda falls into the soccer league category
NWM068	6B	a	2	yeah let's pass on that
NWM068	6B	f	2	uh hhh
NWM068	6B	o	1	maybe
NWM068	6B	s	1	maybe
NWM068	6B	o	1	that seems
NWM068	6B	a	2	you'd think so yeah
NWM068	6B	o	1	so maybe cut that one from our public service type thing
NWM068	6B	o	1	i would say
NWM068	6B	a	1	right
NWM068	6B	a	2	yeah right 
NWM068	6B	c	2	doesn't that seem like it would be a private type of thing
NWM068	6B	o	1	okay so pass on that one
NWM068	6B	o	1	looks like we could do the
NWM068	6B	s	1	looks like we could do the
NWM068	6B	o	1	kitten and puppy adoption
NWM068	6B	s	1	kitten and puppy adoption
NWM068	6B	o	1	and then may the things for the kids the junior soccer league and basketball club
NWM068	6B	s	1	and then may the things for the kids the junior soccer league and basketball club
NWM068	6B	s	1	sound good
NWM068	6B	x	1	interesting
NWM068	6B	o	1	seems like it could be a private thing too
NWM068	6B	c	1	seems like it could be a private thing too
NWM068	6B	o	2	so maybe not there yeah definitely
NWM068	6B	o	2	guess it depends on how much of a concern like the traffic and 
NWM068	6B	c	2	guess it depends on how much of a concern like the traffic and 
NWM068	6B	c	2	it's pretty bad here 
NWM068	6B	o	2	so that might be helpful
NWM068	6B	s	1	so yeah
NWM068	6B	o	2	no
NWM068	6B	f	2	yeah i don't know 
NWM068	6B	o	2	it's a tough one
NWM068	6B	o	1	doesn't it seem like it could be a private thing too
NWM068	6B	s	1	doesn't it seem like it could be a private thing too
NWM068	6B	o	1	so maybe we'll come back to these ones
NWM068	6B	a	1	yeah it does
NWM068	6B	o	1	i guess pass on that one
NWM068	6B	o	2	uh definitely that's that's important one
NWM068	6B	o	2	pretty nice to have a subway
NWM068	6B	o	2	let's throw that
NWM068	6B	o	2	kinda goes into the same as the ones above 
NWM068	6B	c	2	kinda goes into the same as the ones above 
NWM068	6B	o	2	so not
NWM068	6B	o	2	doesn't seem like a like it needs to be a government thing
NWM068	6B	c	2	doesn't seem like a like it needs to be a government thing
NWM068	6B	s	1	how bout massage certificates
NWM068	6B	o	2	i th that one seems
NWM068	6B	f	1	well i don't know
NWM068	6B	o	2	seems kind of an odd one 
NWM068	6B	s	2	doesn't it 
NWM068	6B	o	2	maybe that could be a private
NWM068	6B	o	1	like company for somebody
NWM068	6B	c	2	uh w i wouldn't want my public government to be paying for that
NWM068	6B	f	1	i don't think
NWM068	6B	a	1	yeah
NWM068	6B	t	2	what's that
NWM068	6B	a	2	what's that
NWM068	6B	o	2	so maybe not on that one
NWM068	6B	o	2	same as before
NWM068	6B	c	2	same as before
NWM068	6B	a	2	yeah i'd say that too
NWM068	6B	o	2	i'd think so 
NWM068	6B	c	2	especially since it rains so much here s that would make sense
NWM068	6B	s	1	which of these is not like the other for you
NWM068	6B	o	1	um okay let's see
NWM068	6B	o	1	i'm thinking like
NWM068	6B	o	1	flagpole repair towing services
NWM068	6B	o	1	and teaching certificates
NWM068	6B	s	1	teaching certificates you think
NWM068	6B	o	1	teaching certificates you think
NWM068	6B	a	1	okay yeah
NWM068	6B	c	1	education's important
