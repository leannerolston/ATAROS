So if you - why don't you just, like, pull one out and then we can talk about it.
{VOC mouthnoise} Maybe {QUAL lengthened} we could do multiple.
Alright. {NVC} Boxes of doughnuts. {QUAL lengthened}
{VOC laugh} So, what I'm thinking is -
either near the baking things or near sorta the c- like -
{VOC mouthnoise} Processed food.
Books, scissors. .. I have socks.
Um, I think that -
{VOC mouthnoise} Um. .. {VOC breath} Maybe books and scissors could go near -
Books could go near toys, I think. Maybe.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah! Sure.
Mm. {QUAL lengthened} .. Maybe right here. I think right above it.
Yeah.
Sure. {QUAL lengthened} Yeah, that looks great. {VOC laugh}
And then socks. {QUAL breathy} {VOC laugh} Um.
Socks.
{NVC} We can make, like, a clothing kind of spot.
Okay. 'I'm gonna {PRN I'muhnuh} put it right here.
Okay. Cool. {VOC breath} And then, for boxes of doughnuts, um -
Or maybe next 'to {PRN tuh} - .. Yeah, we can do that.
{NVC} Yeah. .. Cool.
For deck chairs. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath}
Oh. {QUAL whispering}
Yeah. {QUAL lengthened} {QUAL whispering} Sure.
Power cords.
{VOC breath} Yeah, kind of - Yeah, right here.
Okay. Cool.
Yes. {QUAL lengthened}
Sure! Yeah, that's a good spot.
Yeah.
Liters of water. I would -
I would maybe put that in - on - somewhere in this {VOC breath} aisle. Because .. that's something you might take -
So, I 'don't {PRN on't} know. .. Yeah.
Maybe {QUAL lengthened} here? Is that okay?
Shoot. .. There's, like, awkward spacing here. {QUAL muttering}
Um.
Okay! Yeah. Let's do that.
{NVC} Oh that should go with scissors and - Yeah. Cool. {NVC}
Yeah, go over here.
{VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Put it by the -
ice cream. No. I don't know. {VOC laugh} Um, we can - {QUAL lengthened}
Yeah.
We could hold off on the cases of whiskey, maybe, and see what else comes up.
Gas-powered cookstoves would definitely go in this area.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yes. {NVC}
{VOC breath} Sure!
Soy beans.
Over there. {VOC laugh} No, they're not just vests, they are *large. {VOC laugh}
Oh really? That's funny. .. Yeah, we can put that there.
{NVC} Yes.
{VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Should hats go here?
In this area?
Uh-oh, we're encroaching on the cans of stuff. .. {VOC breath} Mint toothpaste and *beets. Toothpaste.
Um.
Toilet paper!
Sweet.
Um, beets. Shoot. {QUAL muttered}
I mean - This could go near .. eggs.
Let's -
{VOC mouthnoise} I'm gonna put heavy cable over here.
Yeah, we should do that. {NVC}
Yes.
(Good) thinking.
(Looks) - Sure. Yeah.
'These could {PRN ss'd} go near each other.
That's kind of like a .. instant food.
{NVC} Right. {NVC}
Around this {VOC mouthnoise} pre-cut wood?
{VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Bundles of sticks, cool.
Um.
Ooh. That should go in this - (this is) sweets area.
Um. Oh, but this is sweets, too. {QUAL muttering} Oh, that's *baking though. Important distinction.
{VOC breath} Right.
This area?
Here.
This area.
{NVC} Yeah.
Bottles of juice. I think that could go down here.
{VOC mouthnoise} I would put it here. {QUAL muttering}
{NVC} Tweezers should go here, I think.
Peat m-
Is it okay if I put it here?
Okay.
Yeah, anything - I guess I'll try to group together things that .. you could use outside, or like, if you're doing utility type things, but -
we could have a, um, We could have - k-
Okay. .. Sure.
Sticks of butter, f- Oh, sticks of butter. Do you agree it should go near cake mix and sugar? Okay, cool. {VOC breath}
{NVC} 'Yes. {PRN yayuss} {NVC}
Could go right - (??) Er.
What were you thinking?
Okay.
Yeah.
That's a good idea.
Box knives. .. {VOC breath} Bars of *soap. That can go - Is this okay? {NVC} Cool.
That's very specific. {QUAL amused} Yeah, perfect! We - It's a good thing we left that open. 'I'm gonna {PRN I'muhnuh} put this next to small axes. .. Maybe. .. (Eh)?
Yeah.
Yeah! {QUAL whispering}
Either. Either spot I think is probably fine. {NVC}
Yeah! Perfect. {QUAL laughing}
Just p- stick it up there, maybe. {QUAL whispering}
{NVC} Yes.
Pet food.
Or - or next to toys, I mean, kinda just more miscellaneous items.
Um.
I don't know. Or we can .. hold off on (it, mm). {QUAL muttering}
Sure.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah. That would - I think that makes sense.
Buckets could go here.
Or near the peat moss.
Near the - (??) we put the peat moss?
Oh, perfect. {NVC}
This area?
Yes.
Um. {QUAL lengthened}
Let's do {QUAL lengthened} - {QUAL muttering}
We can - Hm.
{VOC laugh} {VOC breath} We can put bagels -
here.
Maybe? Yeah.
And then I will put -
beets .. here. {VOC laugh}
{NVC} And then -
Cases of whiskey can go here.
Yes, perfect.
Cool!
(Well) there 'were {PRN er} a lot of unrelated things that couldn't really be grouped together.
Yes. {QUAL lengthened} We do.
Yeah, it's okay. {VOC laugh} Alright, I think - You think we're done?
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay.
Sweet.
'It's {PRN ts} so quiet in here.
It's creepy, it's very creepy. {VOC laugh} Cuz I live on a busy street, so I'm used to - {VOC mouthnoise}
Do wanna do one at a time or multiple .. at a time?
Yeah, I think that's good.
The canned things. They also have ice cream up here. So that's, like, sweets.
And then, yeah, I have books and scissors.
Yeah, or travel guide- Yeah, between toys and travel guides?
Do y- wanna do -
Or .. below travel guides.
What you think?
We 'could {PRN k} do, like -
Okay.
Sh- Just books. Okay. Wanna put scissors here too?
Like, here?
Yeah, there's nothing like that up here. There's a lot of space right here. We could make a spot.
Mm-hm.
Sounds good. {NVC}
(Do we) wanna put it next to ice cream?
Cushions for deck chairs? .. Next to -
I don't know, boating supplies or siding.
And then -
Electric heaters.
Yeah, next to power cords.
And saw. {QUAL creaky}
Next to siding?
Yeah, between.
And we're putting .. clothing over here, right? Do we want light jackets maybe .. (2x) here?
In case we get any more -
Uh. .. Hm.
Okay.
Camping?
Yeah. {QUAL laughing}
Do we w- Or we could put it .. over here, somewhere.
Loose-leaf paper. {VOC breath} So we wanna put that - Yeah.
Backpacks, probably the same .. ish spot?
Whiskey. {VOC laugh}
Thick sweaters probably go over here.
Okay.
And small axes, maybe next to small saws?
And duct tape? Maybe -
next to mousetraps?
{VOC breath} Cans of peas, probably go next to soybeans? Large vests.
Shoelaces again!
They usually have shoelaces next to, like, the -
school stuff, actually, I think.
Packages.
Cookies, next to - .. Right here?
Mess up our egg section with, uh -
Sure. {QUAL lengthened} Yeah.
Oh, toilet paper.
When you buy beets, are they usually fresh, or - ?
Okay.
So we probably want, like, a - .. Yeah. .. We could put, like, a veggie aisle over here.
{VOC mouthnoise} Oh. There's wetsuits. .. We could probably put .. next to boating supplies or cushions.
And, uh, pre-cut wood. .. Next to liters of water, maybe, for camping? Across from those -
Oatmeal.
Yeah. Over there.
Matches are probably up there.
(with).. uh - {NVC}
Yeah, with the wood.
Not that you can do much with it. And then {QUAL laughing} the sticks.
Chocolate bars.
{NVC} Yeah.
Yeah, that's baking. {NVC}
That is sometimes muddled at grocery stores, I feel.
Empty plastic jugs.
Yeah.
Sounds good. .. Fish hooks? Next to -
boating s- (2x)
'That {PRN th} sounds good. {VOC breath}
{NVC} Half-inch tubing. Is this, like, for - ?
for .. {NVC} boating, or - ? Yeah. .. Okay.
Peat moss. .. Do we have any - ?
'Tweezers. {PRN ntweezers}
We don't really have any hardware stuff or .. {NVC} gardening.
Well, (??), that's, like, our camping, {QUAL lengthened} right?
Do we wanna do - We - we could just put it, like -
up here? Or over here, for, like, hardware, gardening stuff.
Mm-hm.
Well, I suppose we could put it next to mousetraps.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. {VOC breath}
Fishing net, next to fish hooks, maybe? {VOC breath}
Tow ropes. .. Can we fit that .. over here? Next to -
Or up here? Next to wetsuits and boating supplies? {VOC breath}
Box knives. {QUAL muttering}
Bars of soap. {QUAL muttering}
Yeah.
(That's toiletries right?) {QUAL muttering} Fleece-lined boots.
Specific. We can put that next to socks! {VOC breath} {VOC laugh}
Box knives? Yeah, that 'sounds {PRN ssounds} {NVC} dandy. {VOC breath} Dried figs. Next to -
Cups.
Next to empty {QUAL laughing} plastic jugs?
Heavy coats. Oh no, we've run out of space! {VOC breath}
It'll be on the end.
I don't know why you'd have coats on the end, but that's okay. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} Five-pound weights .. should be -
with the, uh -
{NVC} With the pet food? What? Yeah.
What kind of weights are these - ? Are we talking - ?
Okay.
We could put them -
Halfway in between? {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}
Oh, like {NVC} here.
Eggs timers would be next to .. eggs, maybe? {VOC breath}
Sure. Sounds great. {VOC breath}
Oh, I have buckets in (my han-) {QUAL muttering}
Peat moss is right here.
Face {QUAL laughing} cream. Next to {VOC breath} tweezers.
And - .. {NVC} We still have whiskey.
{VOC mouthnoise} This store doesn't sell bread? Kinda store *is this?
Here?
Okay.
{NVC} 'It'll {PRN ll} be it's own bread section.
Okay. {NVC}
Whiskey -
'Up there. {PRN pthere} Right next to baking!
Yeah, and we have a lot of empty space. {VOC breath}
But that's okay.
Yeah, (??).
Yeah, I think we're done.
Cool.
Yeah, it's kinda creepy, actually. {VOC laugh}
Oh, yeah?
{VOC breath} This is how *I propose we go about it. So -
We can look at something, and say, like, *definitely not cut, *definitely do cut, or unsure. {VOC breath} And then *I can keep track just, like, {VOC mouthnoise} on my hands how many things we say we definitely *should cut. {VOC breath} And then - .. I don't know. If you have any other ideas. But that's just {VOC breath} what I thought might be a good idea. .. And then we could maybe revisit them.
Sure.
I {QUAL lengthened} don't think those should be cut.
I know. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} I think assistant cooks can be cut. {VOC laugh} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Unl- {VOC laugh} In my opinion. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} I don't know, that's why it can be cut! {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Okay.
I think that's a good idea.
Yes.
portant?
Kay. .. {VOC breath} Football equipment.
{VOC mouthnoise} I'd be down for that. {VOC laugh} Football gets too much funding. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} I think we could -
cut -
Right right right. They don't - they- they can - They don't need to be thespians. {VOC breath} Alright.
Mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Right. {VOC breath} (??)
I think that's important. Yeah. {VOC breath}
Right right right. That's why we can cut the assistant cooks.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, we should keep that.
W- yes. Yeah w- Yeah. {VOC laugh}
{VOC mouthnoise} Bookkeeping classes.
Tha- I think those are important.
Yes. I agree. {VOC mouthnoise} Okay, so we cut four. {VOC breath} So, let's cut four from everything else.
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay. {VOC breath} I don't think reproductive education should be cut.
Or nor job training programs.
This is gonna be the hard one.
Chicken pox vaccinations are pretty important.
Um.
S_T_D_ .. education should probably not be cut.
{VOC breath} In rela- in relation to the other things, it can probably be cut.
As can weed control. {QUAL creaky}
That's a little further down. Yeah. {VOC mouthnoise} Those -
I'm not really sure what that means. {QUAL muttered} Oh, like adding on to the hospital. {VOC breath} Mm. {QUAL lengthened}
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think -
{VOC breath} My opinion is to cut sex offender database and neighborhood watch support. {VOC start} That's - But -
Just .. {VOC laugh} {VOC mouthnoise} Just by process of elimination.
{VOC breath} The other two .. were in- the invasive species removal and weed control.
Yeah.
So. Do you agree with that?
{VOC breath} Maybe, um -
Right right right.
{VOC breath} Yeah, we could cut hospital additions instead of the sex offender database. {VOC mouthnoise} Okay!
Sure.
Ta- er, invasive .. species -
Sweet! {VOC breath} Okay.
Recreation and public services.
{VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Stray cat spaying.
{VOC laugh} {VOC breath} I think that's important. {VOC breath} Um, to keep -
the .. homeless animal population down.
Yeah, (make) sure.
Mm-hm!
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} We'll think about it. {VOC breath}
Oh! {QUAL long o, rising pitch} Yeah. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Yes. I agree.
Yes.
Yeah, I think it is.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Boy's basketball club. Maybe {QUAL lengthened} we can -
cut that and keep the soccer league?
I don't know. .. {QUAL creaky} Mm. {QUAL reluctant, unsure}
{VOC breath} Right.
I dunno, these ones are kind of hard to pick because a lot of these are important in my opinion. {VOC breath}
No.
Right.
Right.
I 'don't {PRN on't} know what that means.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath}  Well I think that .. we should choose between public news station and public access station. I don't think we need both. {VOC breath}
Sure.
Okay.
Yeah. .. {VOC laugh} Stick with that trend. {VOC breath}
No.
Righ- {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
So that means we would be cutting dog catcher, boy's basketball club, .. football stadium upkeep, and the public access station.
Are you okay with those four?
Okay.
Sure. {VOC breath} .. {VOC mouthnoise} Maybe, um -
Instead of the boy's basketball club?
Or -
{VOC breath} Okay, so then we'd have both the public access station and public news station. {VOC breath} That's fine.
Yeah! Okay, cool.
Um .. dog catcher? {VOC breath}
Okay. Yeah, we can cut one of the animal things. There's like f- four of them. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Okay, infrastructure and licensing. {VOC mouthnoise} Definitely cut speed limit signs. No, I'm just kidding! {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} Probably not a good idea. Um -
Alright, so teaching certificates we should keep.
{VOC breath} Speed limit signs, we should keep.
{VOC breath} I think -
additional bus stops, .. we should keep.
Because I think we can get rid of some of these licenses.
Like tattoo artist .. license.
You want them to be licensed. That's a good point, actually.
{VOC breath} That's a good point.
Ah. {QUAL lengthened} Dang. .. Okay.
We'll think about it. .. Man, po- That's important. I don't think we should cut that. {VOC breath}
I know.
I personally think those could get .. cut.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure sure sure.
That can be cut! Screw that! Cuz - {VOC breath} cuz if we're not cutting subway system or bus, then we can cut taxi.
{VOC breath} I think we ha- we're at three, cuz we're cutting - {VOC breath}
Boo- Oh.
Hunting tags -
And taxi stops. .. So, these four.
Cool. So we're keeping fishing licenses, public bus upkeep, drainage ditches. {VOC breath} Okay, cool! So, we're done.
That wasn't too bad.
{VOC breath} Now I know why a lot of people -
{VOC mouthnoise} Why it's hard - it's hard to pick things to cut. {VOC breath} But then you can look at .. like, politicians, you think they're jerks cuz it's, like, How can you cut {VOC breath} something for animals? And it's, like, well .. compared to something else - Right. {VOC breath}
However, .. many people are usually making a decision, yeah. {QUAL breathy}
Right.
Don't have to try to get people to vote for us or anything.
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay.
Okay.
That's fine. {VOC breath}
Yeah. .. Okay.
Sounds good.
So, (we just) wanna start at .. math tutors? {VOC breath}
Yeah, we- let's .. keep .. those. {VOC mouthnoise} We're probably gonna keep, like, everything. {VOC breath} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
{NVC} {VOC breath} Yeah. {VOC breath} I- w- what is an assistant cook? I don't know. {VOC breath}
Yeah, okay. Sounds good.
That's fine. {VOC breath}
Um - {VOC breath} sex ed. .. 'We'll {PRN wull} keep .. that?
Okay.
Custodians are good.
{NVC} Yeah. Okay.
Cool. {VOC breath} {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} I'd be down for cutting it. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Yeah. .. Acting coaches?
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay. Yeah. Especially if it's adult education. {VOC breath} Uh -
Uh, so, no more acting coaches. Poetry books.
Are probably good.
{VOC breath} Special ed teachers are good.
Cooking classes -
are good. Yeah. We still have our main cooks, right? No. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Uh -
Notetakers for disability services are .. good.
Sugar - We should get rid of the sugar-free juice machine.
Who needs .. water - {VOC laugh} for - ? {VOC laugh} No. {VOC breath}
Uh -
Are - I think those are good. Yeah.
And music teachers are .. important.
(I too.)
So that's f- four?
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay.
No. {VOC breath}
This is gonna be the hard one. {VOC laugh}
'Yeah. .. {PRN uhyeah} I didn't know they .. (had that one). {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}
Yeah.
is important, but it - {VOC mouthnoise}
{VOC start} Yeah.
Oh, w- there's a weed control? Yeah. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Wee- yeah. {VOC breath} Toxic waste disposal's important. Hospital additions are - {VOC mouthnoise}
Yeah.
Maybe .. ma- that's a maybe? Maybe maybe?
{VOC breath} Uh, needle exchange is .. good.
{VOC mouthnoise} Uh -
Sex offender database.
Okay. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
And then -
What were the other two that we already decided on?
{VOC mouthnoise} And weed control. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Sex offender database is -
is, uh, .. I dunno.
{VOC breath} It's in the *news, even. {VOC breath} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} I think that's -
Okay. .. Let's do that. So, hospital additions, {VOC breath} neighborhood watch -
uh -
{VOC start} weed control, and -
inva- vasive species removal.
{NVC} Yeah.
Maybe a maybe, for now.
Public news station .. is -
good. .. But -
Yeah. .. Food bank .. is keep. Junior soccer league -
Probably keep. .. Or, maybe .. somewhere - {VOC breath} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Kitten and puppy adoption .. is good.
'If we're {PRN vwe're} gonna keep stray cat spaying, we should probably keep kitten and puppy adoption.
Uh, .. soup kitchens are good.
Housing assistance is .. good.
Dog catcher?
That's, uh, .. it's {PRN ts} probably .. cuttable.
Boy's basketball. {QUAL muttered}
{VOC laugh} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} I suppose the junior soccer league is not .. gender-specific. {VOC breath}
Yeah. {VOC breath} They're important -
But they're not vital, so that's hard.
There's (just) not, like, an obvious choice. {VOC breath} Public 'access - {PRN assex} access station.
I think that's, like -
like, P_B_S -
{NVC} type thing.
{VOC mouthnoise} Hm. {VOC mouthnoise}
Maybe not. .. I would probably cut the access station .. first. {VOC breath}
Veterinary hospital.
If we're -
animal lovers already, we should probably stick with it. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Football stadium upkeep, .. no.
(Wait), as you said, football gets too much money already, right? {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Okay.
{VOC breath} I'd rather cut -
po- pest control over something else. Pest control doesn't seem like a - {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} I would say instead of the public access station. {VOC breath}
Yeah. {QUAL falling pitch}
Yeah.
Okay.
{VOC mouthnoise} So -
We're -
Pest control, football stadium upkeep, .. boy's basketball club, and .. uh -
{VOC start} 'What was {PRN wuhwas} the fourth one?
Yeah, dog catcher. Yeah, there it is.
{VOC mouthnoise} Mm-hm. {NVC}
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
Okay.
Okay. {QUAL amused}
{VOC breath} {VOC breath} The only thing about tattoo artists is, like -
Yeah. .. You (could, it could) be {VOC hesitation} .. bad {VOC laugh} if there's unlicensed tattoo artists around. {VOC breath}
Uh .. boating licenses -
Maybe .. {QUAL creaky} {VOC start} Yeah. Pothole maintenance.
Yeah.
{VOC breath} Subway system is important. Although that's, like, way more money {QUAL laughing} than the other things, probably. But - {VOC breath} uh -
Hunting tags.
Yeah. I think so.
Towing services could probably get cut .. also. {VOC breath} Massage certificates. .. Probably cut massage certificates before tattoo artists. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} But - {VOC breath} Taxi stops. Why is the government making taxi stops anyway? {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Right. {VOC breath}
Uh, .. fishing licenses .. kee- well, so, how much are we up at?
Hunting tags, towing services - {VOC mouthnoise}
and massage certificates?
And taxi stops. (??) those four. {QUAL laughing} Okay. {VOC breath} Done. {VOC breath}
Cool. {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath}
Yeah.
Right.
And there's just two of us! As compared to -
lot's more {QUAL laughing} people.
{VOC breath} Yeah.
And we don't have anybody pressuring us.
Okay.
Okay.
Kay, whatcha got? {PRN NVC throughout}
Okay.
Well, I thought they were for fishing, .. like fo- boats fish- like anchors.
Okay.
Yeah, I think so.
Okay.
Okay, electric *heaters. Do we have a stove up there, or {VOC mouthnoise} - We have -
Oh, I see. Household. {VOC breath} Okay.
Electric heaters. Oh -
Si- .. Power cords or siding? .. Siding goes outside. {VOC breath} .. Electric heaters? .. Okay.
{VOC laugh}.. I do too. .. {VOC mouthnoise}
{VOC mouthnoise} Here's your wetsuits. .. {VOC mouthnoise} Okay.
Why?
Yeah.
Yeah, see I thought there were for, like, starting fires too. Which went with camping. Yeah. .. Yeah.
Although they could be used at home for star- Okay. .. (??) .. Okay. {QUAL muttering}
Yeah.
Nah. .. Oh well, depends. {VOC breath} But we're adults!
Okay.
And box knives?
Mouse traps. {QUAL muttering}
Yeah. .. {NVC}
Well, now I have pre-cut wood, so -
Yeah.
Well then, okay. You're right. Mouse traps, box knives, hardware.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Bags of peat moss.
Where's the garden stuff?
They have no garden stuff? In the Northwest, they have no garden stuff?
Kay, let's put it right there.
Okay this is in - Well, these big box things are kind of -
everything store. They're not -
You know, in - In the city we have -
camping stores, and we have -
You know, they're more - They're not (as) centralized, but this is all centralized, so - {VOC breath} Target s- {VOC breath} Yeah so I'd put em under - Yeah. .. T- {VOC cough} Yeah.
Okay.
Kay, mint toothpaste. {NVC}
Toilet paper.
Oh. What do you use liters of water for? People buy em for drinking water, don't they?
So there's -
Yeah.
Well, I used to use em for .. photography stuff. So - But this is not - that's not - I think it would go with eggs.
Groceries.
Along with the sticks of butter, right?
Wait a minute. .. Sticks of butter, eggs, and liters of water.
And this is sugar, and cake mix, so -
Okay, so where are clothes gonna go?
No. {QUAL lengthened} {QUAL muttering}
Clothing is dry goods.
Well - {VOC mouthnoise} Yeah-
Well -
'Yeah {PRN kyeah}, this is kinda hardware. And these are toys, {VOC breath} travel guides, books.
Are we?
Hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay.
Yeah, it doesn't really fit .. any of these places, does it?
That's true. .. That's a good point.
Yeah.
Let's put it below here.
Okay.
Well, what are the k- 'Uh {PRN sigh of frustration}
S- {QUAL lengthened} .. Let's make a whole clothing section. {VOC breath} Let's not mix em up.
If we had 'camouflage {PRN cahm-} gear that would go over - .. Yeah. .. Okay. Socks?
Okay.
Yeah.
I th- I agree.
And half-inch tubing, that's in here.
Well -
Pat uses it for like some- some little fishing things. .. So - He also uses it for scientific stuff but, um - {VOC laugh}
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sure.
And fishing net.
Shoe laces. .. You know what? I find when I go - Yeah, oh good. Cuz I find when I go into a store, a lot of times shoelaces are off in some little {VOC breath} miscellaneous section with all those things hanging on the wall.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Large cups, kitchen stuff.
K- Um. .. I guess. {QUAL negative}
Refrigerator magnets. .. But that's -
Yeah, okay.
We have -
Picnic supplies?
No.
Yeah.
So, we'd have to assume that this is paper large cups.
Okay.
Okay.
(1x) .. Now, this is gas powered cook stoves. (Now), since I haven't seen any other {VOC breath} appliances I would -
Yeah.
We'll have to move it down.
A little. *Cheat a little.
Toiletries. {QUAL muttering}
Well that means they have to re- re- restock. .. Oh no. No. We didn't. No. That's - Yeah. Right. Okay. {VOC breath} Hats- an- hats.
Okay.
Okay.
Large vests.
{VOC laugh} Along with .. *boxes of donuts! {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} Yes. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
Did we do toiletries? Yes.
Okay, face cream, right?

Because w- (ba-) We eat this for *snacks. .. Sometimes. Cuz y- you know, there's different kinds!
Yeah, okay. .. Okay.
{NVC} Okay.
(Yeah, kay.) {QUAL whispering}
Okay.
Cuz we don't have landscaping stuff, do we?
Oh, yeah. .. Yeah. .. Okay, yeah that's a good place.
Loose leaf paper.
School supplies? .. Mm-kay.
Cases of whiskey. Oh, put it under the camping. {VOC laugh} I guess. I guess. Yeah.
{VOC breath} There we go. It's on the end of the e- Right.
Yeah.
Yeah. Right. .. That's right.
It's on the end cap.
Okay. {VOC mouthnoise} Cans of peas?
Kay.
(The-) we should put *chocolate on the end of the (ai)-.
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah. Okay.
Pouches of oatmeal.
Well, we've got food over here. .. Let's put em with the eggs.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Well face c- face cream. Soap.
Buckets. Mousetraps. {NVC} {NVC}
But they're *little. {NVC}
Hey that's - Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Sa- Small saws and small axes. .. Scissors.
Okay.
It means - means something b- Siding. Where's siding?
Yeah.
Hey, there we go. {VOC breath} Should we move this electric heater?
Yeah, cuz it - This is - Yeah, I do. .. Hardware?
And empty plastic jugs.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay m-
Cushions for deck chairs, boating supplies, five pound weights, wet suits, tow ropes, half-inch tubing, books of matches, power cords, heavy cable, empty plastics - That makes sense.
{VOC breath} Hooks, nets, sticks -
Yeah.
Okay.
What?
Okay. .. We didn't leave very much room for books.
Oh but tra- But they'd have room up here and up here. {VOC breath} Okay.
Rolls of duct tape, mouse traps, box knives, precut wood, buckets. Okay.
Shoelaces, socks, {VOC breath} clothes {QUAL muttering} -
Yeah.
Here we go.
Ice cream, chocolate bars.
W- No but we ha- We're deciding right now. I mean, they've already started moving things in -
I mean we're running - I mean there must be *four miles between these aisles, but we're running back and forth putting th- up signs where they're supposed to be, right? {VOC breath} Okay.
Yeah, me too. I like it.
Yeah, well you could shop here. {QUAL muttering} {VOC laugh}
Okay. .. Uh, let's take two or three and work - work a group.
{NVC}.. {VOC breath} I have five pound weights, and I think those go with {VOC breath} mouse traps, or boating supplies. Somewhere on this side.
{VOC breath} And I don't much care where. Do you think - care where?
{VOC start} .. Right. So let's essentially put it up here. {VOC breath} I won't put it right next - It is a boating supply. We'll put it - Part of it. Okay. {VOC mouthnoise} Your turn.
No, but I think it - Mouse tr- Sort of household equipment.
{NVC} Or power cords.
Oh, I think power cords sounds good.
Sure.
A package of cookies. {VOC breath} Now we hafta - I think it goes with the ice cream. Totally good.
That was a good idea.
Alright that goes up here. {VOC breath}
Okay, bundles of sticks. I think this goes with mouse traps. It's sort - {VOC breath} Well it's because, {VOC breath} .. um, .. I think these bundles of sticks are for starting fires. {VOC breath} And it's sort of - {VOC breath}
things that you use in your house, or your farm, or whatever {VOC breath} that are not -
And you thought it was camping.
Well, that would be okay with me.
Why don't we save it. .. (1x)- and see where we have space. My next one is books, and I think that goes with the travel guides. .. {VOC breath} Or the toys, but let's -
They're right at - .. But you know they're - .. I know but they're - See, they're right across the aisle.
Okay.
Mouse traps.
Sort of household equipment, yeah. .. 'Choo {PRN voiceless sound effect}
{VOC laugh} Tow ropes. And I'm gonna put that with boating.
{VOC breath} I'm gonna save bundles of sticks (??) -
So, that's like um .. hardware I think.
Sure.
And bundles of sticks should go - When we get to the camping equipment, which we haven't got yet, we'll put this with that.
So I'm gonna get us more here. .. Cuz I'm holding on to this one.
That's the gardening stuff. Do we have any - ? We have nothing for gardening.
Well, I would put it here. .. M-
Okay. {VOC breath} So here is {NVC} our .. two camping things. Backpacks - {VOC breath} Unless we're gonna say backpacks are school supplies. {VOC breath} In which case they should be near toys and books maybe. .. And then I think there's going to be paper in there.
Let's decide they're school supplies.
Yeah but Target or - Uh - {QUAL faint} {VOC breath} Yeah, but Target has, uh, everything.
Let's {VOC start} - We're gonna have school supplies .. in this area.
Okay. Your turn.
Yep.
Liters of water. {QUAL lengthened}
Liter -
Uh, a whole liter is pretty big. {VOC breath} It could either be drinking water - .. We can put it over here. {VOC breath} Or it could be like for, um -
uh, distilled water for -
things you use - You know, your iron, and stuff.
Yeah. It could be anyway.
Sure.
Yep, for sure that goes there. {VOC breath} F- Uh-oh, we haven't left any room for this.
I don't - I can't move it once I put it up.
I'm good at - Alright, we have not left any place for clothes.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} So -
I think maybe opposite - Over here. Because we haven't really got another aisle for it. {VOC breath} We don't want em with sugar and cake mixes if we don't - .. can help it. .. Do we?
Yeah. {VOC breath} So it could be - .. I don't want it by siding, much. .. I'd rather have it opposite boating.
I don't know. What do you think?
We're gonna have a lot of clothes. .. {VOC breath} I mean three or four things it seems to me. Socks, vests -
{VOC breath} So it's gonna be arbitrary. Is what it .. comes down to. We could have it -
No. {VOC breath} But - {VOC breath} .. We could have it -
sort of opposite here because this is personal things, and clothes are personal.
I mean it's not ve- It's not - I wouldn't organize a store this way, but we're sorta stuck.
Or we could put it below here. I don't remember -
Thick - Or we could put thick sweaters over with camping, when we get to camping.
Do you want to do that and have the - ? .. U- Nah. Alright, so I have light jackets.
U- .. (Well), let's put it right here.
{NVC} Yeah.
Okay, so I put up two because it had two.
Yeah.
Good. .. {VOC breath} And w- They can go up opposite if we need to. {VOC breath} Rolls of duct tape is gonna go with mouse traps.
Okay.
I don't know what that is .. for but - .. I guess it's a supply.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
So now I have small axes. {VOC breath} And I th- .. I think we're gonna put camping up here, right?
May I put sticks up there too?
Kay.
Okay. {NVC}
Alright.
Socks.
{VOC breath} Or one of - One of the - Or one of those little ter- twirly things, (you know).
{VOC mouthnoise} Alright, *now. Large cups. {VOC breath} And I think that goes by toilet paper. I'm assuming these are paper cups.
What do you think they are? Kitchen equipment?
Refrigerator magnets?
We don't have anything else like that yet.
Well, it could be -
Or could be down here.
I don't remember anything else like this. .. Do you?
{VOC mouthnoise} Well, .. toilet paper is paper goods.
Paper cup.
Yeah.
So, we're gonna assume that.
If there's a test, we'll explain our thinking.
Oh.
Put em with camping.
With the sticks and the axe 'and - {VOC breath} But not with 'siding oh (gosh){PRN NVC running through this stretch}
It's okay. .. {VOC breath} Alright, tweezers - It's okay. {VOC breath} Tweezers should be going with the toilet paper, and mint toothpaste, but we've run out of space. .. {VOC breath} So I'm gonna - {QUAL muttering}
Put this up a little bit.
Okay.
{VOC breath} It's gonna be opposite the other clothes cuz we're gonna run out of space. {VOC breath} And my heavy coats are gonna be there. .. Oh, and lucky me.
Alright. {NVC} Now we get to decide on chocolate bars. And I think it's gonna be opposite - at the top. Right over here, next to ice cream.
'Okay. {PRN starts with /h/} {VOC laugh}
{VOC laugh} Oh yes! Right there! Excellent. Excellent. Alright, *beets. That goes down here with soy beans. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} Okay.
Yeah. {VOC breath}
Yeah, i- I wish we could put it down here.
But it's okay.
I - I thought it was whatever - .. {VOC breath} I wish - It's - Tweezers and face cream should go together. .. {VOC breath} We're gonna do that. {NVC}
How's that?
Alright so, egg timers. {VOC breath} And - {VOC breath} We do - .. We have it - .. We don't *yet have a cooking equipment - Oh, cake mixes. Yeah, sure. .. {VOC breath} Or it could go by the eggs.
Yes. .. Alright here we go. {NVC}
Perfect. .. {VOC breath} Bottles of *juice.
Over here. Let's do that.
(That can) - .. Yep. ..  Yep. That's fine. {VOC breath} Or they could go with the mouse traps and stuff, but this is fine. .. {VOC breath} Fleece lined boots, that's our clothing aisle, here.
Okay.
Yeah. .. Uh, yeah, or soy beans. Sort of, um, {VOC breath} bulk foods.
Toasted kinds. Yeah. {NVC} .. So we don't know. .. {VOC breath} But that's fine. It's sort of the raw foods section. {VOC breath} Small saws. Now these are gonna go with siding.
Okay?
No. .. (Well), but we're going to with - The peat moss is down here, so {VOC breath} that's close enough. Okay.
Yep.
Yep.
{VOC laugh} .. H- .. Whiskey.
*Cases. .. {VOC laugh} What - Or with the juice and the water.
Yeah. .. {VOC laugh}
We - Wh- You know what we need is {QUAL laughing} - You know what they call end caps? That's what's at the end of each aisle. {VOC breath} I know. And it's what they want you to buy on impulse. We need to put that - chocolate - {VOC laugh} That's right. Let's do it.
And if they don't not understand it we'll explain it.
Okay.
Hm. .. Sure.
{VOC breath} Cushions for deck chairs.
{VOC laugh} .. Ah, yeah we should.
Okay, so these cushions for deck chairs are gonna go up here and - and they're gonna be, like, on the end cap. .. {VOC breath} Okay.
Yeah.
Sure.
We - We know we have cake coming along, so we gotta save space. .. {VOC breath} So here is bars of soap and {VOC breath} .. they need to go with this stuff.
But not with the -
Clothes. {VOC breath} .. Yeah perfect. *Perfect! {VOC breath} Okay.
Yeah. .. Fine.
Fish hooks. .. {VOC breath} Well we've got all this stuff but - but I - I know. {NVC} {VOC breath} So I'm gonna overlap it a little bit. At- {VOC breath} Let's .. do that.
Sa- Small axes. Okay.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} School supplies.
Yeah, let's put it here.
'Uh {PRN grunt}, that'll do. .. Or next to power cords.
Yeah, put it right there.
{VOC breath} Unless you want that over here.
Okay.
Sure.
That's fine.
We are running out here.
Oh. .. Well, that's a camping thing. That's for carrying things with you.
Okay, I think that's - We've done it!
Stuff at all. .. Yeah, it's okay. {VOC breath} I - I - I think I really would rather have these things with the siding but it - We're not gonna move em.
Well, the - all of these sort of household things, but i- it doesn't really matter. It's fine.
No.
That's right.
Mm-hm.
They'll just have to live with our ca-
Don't make any sense.
Where did we put the cups? Over here? {VOC breath} We could've put em with those things over there. .. The liquids.
Uh-huh.
I hink we're breaking the rules. I think we're not supposed to move things around. {VOC breath} {VOC laugh}
I know. That's right. We have haven't handed anybody a - a map yet.
Right, I'm content now at this -
Yeah.
We could shop here, Ren- Rena.
Okay!
Time's up!
We're gonna not fund junior soccer league because the community will pick it up.
Now - {VOC cough} Uh, where is that?
Is this the - ?
Oh, there it is. *Upkeep. But see, the stadium's there, but that - It's the upkeep.
Well, .. e- Yeah, you need to advertise, uh -
Well, .. your .. upcoming events and stuff, to fill up the stadium, and community news, you need to know what's going on in the police department, and -
Okay. You (was-) ?
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
No, we need that.
Junior soccer league.
Yes.
There's going to be a lot of it if we cut stray cat spaying.
{VOC mouthnoise} .. Well. .. They already doing all the food banks.
Okay, so that's two. What do we - ? What - ? Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
But wait a minute! .. Community news -
Yeah.
Yeah. .. Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, yeah because .. otherwise we're gonna pay for it in euthani- You know, that's expensive.
Yeah.
I agree.
Yep. .. Boys basketball club.
There's already - Well, see we can talk about - about our own communities, cuz it's like in Seattle we have boys and girls clubs (with) all that stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay so that's, um - {VOC mouth noise} .. one - .. No. .. One.
Two.
Three. {QUAL lengthened}
And four.
That's four.
Maybe.
Okay.
Yeah, see the reason behind that one though is public health.
And take out - Take out the licensing stuff? .. We're losing income.
Taxi stops?
Okay.
I don't know.
Okay, yeah - {VOC breath} {VOC cough} Yeah. .. Yep.
Mm-kay, that's two.
What about massage certificates?
Is that to keep an eye on massage parlors?
Okay. .. Oh, okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Uh {QUAL lengthened}, the {QUAL lengthened vowel} junior soccer league, and the boys basketball club.
Yeah.
Kind of.
We wanna put the .. soccer league back in?
See, I'm kinda not for sp- .. Well that's pub- that's recreation, okay.
So we take out the public access station and put back in - ?
Yeah.
Public access, and community and news ads?
Mm. I think it's important to keep the community news ads to keep the community informed and together.
We have a little activist group in our neighborhood that .. pays attention to this an-
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
(Well let's) go for King County.
Yeah.
Okay.
Mm-hm, two so far.
Yeah.
Hospital additions. You get federal and state money for that.
Well -
I don't know, cuz we - You get state and federal money for it.
Well, it's just additions.
When we did the Harborview project, we had state and federal money for that.
Cuz I can't remember if we had county money or not. We must have had county money, cuz we had five - we had five funding sources. Part of it was bond- bonds -
that were set aside already.
So the money was already there for it.
Yeah.
Well, it's a regional hospital now. It's part of a -
Yeah.
Well no, it's operated by - Excuse me I keep going back and - {QUAL laughing} It's operated by University of Washington, which is - which is a -
Yeah.
The thing is, we had county funds, but they were from bonds that had been sold way a long time ago.
Where's our screen? ..
They get funds.
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Prenatal, neighborhood watch, weed control, veteran's medical.
That's a federal, isn't it?
Okay.
Those are big things. Hos- hospital and veterans.
Yeah.
Okay.
Uh. {QUAL lengthened}
The county, .. uh, {QUAL lengthened} has stations. .. So you can take all of your old paint and stuff -
And all your old .. pest chemicals that you're not supposed to use anymore. You take em down there.
Oh good, because we had some {QUAL laughing} - They - But they .. accidentally broke in the garage so we swept em up. {VOC breath} But um -
Yeah, okay. Good, I'm glad you told me that. {QUAL laughing}
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
I'll look it up.
Okay. So - Okay.
Veteran's and hospital.
Boy, we need that.
It's in the schools.
Well. .. Okay. .. W- In King County, if you're under twenty-one, {VOC breath} and um -
you're low income, you go to Public Health Clinic, and they help you with birth control -
and they talk to you about reproduction, and stuff. They're like - {VOC breath} They're like the pl- the - They're the like the poor man's cl- Planned Parenthood.
Although Planned Parenthood takes care of a lot of it too. But it's like school kids (2x). There's clinics all over.
Yeah.
Yeah. .. Oh, do they still?
They used to.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If they'll do it.
I'd - I wo- Oh, I had a terrible time with that when I was a watch captain. But we have a good one in our neighborhood. .. But that's - .. the- I mean, that's - I don't know how many other neighborhoods do.
Okay, so neighborhood watch instead of veterans? .. Okay.
Alright, okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
We got two, two, and two.
Yeah, it's - Cuz- wh- I useta work for the health department, and they had all kinds k- I mean - Yeah.
Kids can go there. .. If they'll go there.
They have to know about it.
Football equipment.
Out.
Well - Uh - You know, uh, sports kept my kids off the streets too. But -
I guess I just have a - kind of a -
bone to pick with -
Where are the impassive -
s- things for kid- the quiet kids? Where are the .. drama, and the music, and the art, {VOC breath} and the poetry, and all this stuff, when football has the big bucks?
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah.
Okay.
Cooking classes? {QUAL muttering}
No, if you're gonna leave in football, we need poetry.
Oh, football equipment? .. Oh.
Okay.
Yeah.
Geez this is hard.
Math, assistant cooks, sex ed, custodians, speech therapy, (??) {QUAL whispering}
Okay.
What?
No! No.
Acting coaches. Not every school has a drama department.
We're leaving in music, and we're leaving in poetry.
Well, we're taking out sugar free juice. Yeah.
{VOC laugh} Okay, so you wanna take out poetry?
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
Oh, what about the county library?
Yeah.
Okay. .. I don't know about your kids, but my kids spent a lot of time in the public library.
Yeah.
Oh my gosh.
Sugar free juice, and poetry.
Okay.
No no, no no no no. It's okay.
Okay.
We would.
So who's gonna supply the equipment?
Do you think they do fi- .. Do you think they'll do funding drives?
Okay.
Football and -
Okay. And no sugar.
Okay. Sugar free, okay.
Okay we got -
football and sugar free. .. We've got, uh {QUAL lengthened} -
And -
Okay.
Okay.
And we've got uh -
Basketball club .. and junior soccer league.
Yeah.
Taxi stop-
Yeah. Okay.
No.
I'm furious! {VOC laugh} I don't want to do this. Ah. {QUAL lengthened} {QUAL laughing}
I know.
Well, but tha- that - some - Mean, some of these things, you know, they do - {VOC breath} For me, they do punch a button.
{VOC breath} Well, the- A few years ago someone did uh, some reporting on this and said that {VOC breath} they don't really know how much money they spend on sports.
You know how much money they *don't spend on .. some of the other things. Like they *don't have art teachers, and some of them don't have music teachers, until you're in high school.
Yeah, we did too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My son did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, all that stuff. Yeah.
We're done really.
So, how are we gonna go about this?
Okay. .. Let's start with recreation program. .. L- and public service list.
Let's (1x) the football stadium too.
Right?
Let's look at this *whole list.
Pu- Recreation and public services. .. Right.
Right.
Well, that's something I think that people will pick up too.
What is community news and ads?{QUAL muttering}
Let's pick one list -
Alright, let's pick one list .. and go through it and decide -
What we absolutely cannot cut -
Because- Once we've got a number -
Of items. .. On a list, then we can see if we can make the others fit it.
Alright, stray cat spaying.
So we have to -
Cut the whole program?
If I have to choose between .. stray cat spaying and community news I can- I'd pick st- .. spaying the cats {VOC breath} Although how they'll know about it when we can't tell them anything, I don't know.
Food bank, no.
We keep that.
Yeah.
Kitten and puppy adoption.
Yeah.
Soup kitchens wh- The public might pick up. .. It's possible that the churches will pick up.
Yeah.
Possibly.
So, the junior soccer league maybe.
Or we- I think we've agreed on that.
The community news, if we absolutely have to.
Soup kitchen if we absolutely have to - No -
Your- Ye- And I - .. I don't know, you probably get something from .. {VOC breath} your city council member.
That is more about how he voted, and what he's doing for you.
Let's -
Do - I mean we can always put it back - Let's say community news goes.
Kitten and puppy adoption, I just think -
Would be a real last choice -
Yeah. {VOC breath} Soup kitchens .. might get picked up by somebody else. Housing assistance has to happen.
Yep. .. I think that the dog catcher has to happen.
Sure.
That's right.
So, I don't think that the county -
Pays very much for basketball clubs. I think that can go.
The public access station, let's assume that is wi-fi and .. internet access.
No d- I don- Do you think that's it?
Not channel nine. {VOC breath} It may be that i- you know channel twenty-seven or something like that?
Let that go.
That's not useful.
Right.
Yep.
Okay.
Now -
And maybe the football stadium.
Alright, so we're gonna l- aim for four or five on one of these other lists.
Take your pick.
See, I think it's gonna get harder when we get into some of these things.
Well, let's do infrastructure and licensing, and I say take out .. tattoo artist licenses.
Yeah, I know.
I would- I wouldn't take out anything on that list if I could help it.
Oh, yeah. I'd take out taxi stops.
I'd take out - Wha- How much does that cost?
Additional bus stops.
We wouldn't have to - We couldn't have to do that.
Uh, yes.
So that if you go to a licensed massage person, they've had some training.
I would only take two out of that list.
The taxi stops and the additional bus stops.
So, now let's go -
To one of these other th- ing- If we only have to take two out of this list, what are the two?
And keep the community news.
And the public access station. Isn't that redundant, kind of?
Yeah.
Or we keep the public - .. Well -
I'd let the public access station go. It's gotta cost more than the community news.
I might be tempted - I were only gonna do two, I might be tempted to d- take both of those.
Yeah.
Stuff.
We have to sort of know what kind of a county we are in. {VOC breath} Is this a county like Seattle, where - {VOC breath} like King County where many city that provide services or are we - Is it a county like -?
Like Whatcom County or -?
Island.
I live in King County.
Alright, we're gonna assume it's King County, {VOC breath} and that there *are services provided by the city.
And by other agencies, like the Boys and Girls club, {VOC breath} so let's take out the junior soccer league, and the boys basketball club.
And keep all the informational things, so we're only doing two, right?
Alright.
Let's do what? Public health?
And you can wait.
Awhile.
Yeah.
Well, but that in some ways - .. But they almost always require matching money I think.
They're not gonna build the hospital based only on federal money.
They might.
They might.
But we could always postpone a year.
Only?
Well, it's King County Hospital.
Right.
Yeah. .. But I think it-
It used to be King County Hospital. .. Is it still? .. Harborview?
But it - But it - It is operated by King County, right? .. So -
It's own-
Oh, right.
Right.
State.
Institution. It probably gets state money and -
Federal money and -
Let's see if it'll come back.
Here it is.
Well, the thi- But my feeling is that the-
A hospital addition can wait.
That and it's a major .. capital.
Expenditure for - to .. create a structure.
Yeah. .. And that it's - that - ..in fact -
It- It doesn't belong in the same budget as .. all these .. operating, on going expense -
Budget, so let's take hospital additions out.
We gotta come up with a second thing though, if we're gonna stick to our two items.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} How much veteran's - How many - Ch - Medical assistance does the county put in to veterans? .. Or is that .. a federal thing? .. Yeah.
I hate - I hate to do that but I -
I don't know how much is there but -
On that principle that - We know there is at least one other provider.
It's not like we're cutting s-
No matter what we do.
Well then, you know, the toxic waste disposal fall in federal too.
Well, that's true,
They do.
And your .. neon bulbs -
Oh. .. Yeah. .. Yeah.
Actually, where you are there's a great place. It's called -
Um. .. Total reclaim, or something like that. It's on sixth avenue, down there in - .. at Sodo. And, you can take anything in there.
It's really great.{QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} I, you know I once took a little bag with two little neon bulbs, {VOC breath} but you can take a computer. I had a Kitchen Aid mixer that .. e- w- had .. totally died, the bearings were totally shot.
Any of those electric - And you don't -
Yeah.
Well this is, {VOC breath} this is where if you take a computer to .. Comp U_S_A_ or something like that {VOC breath} and pay them a fee -
And I think it's call Total Reclaim.
So -
{VOC mouth noise} Alright.
Reproductive education.
So who -Yeah, we do. {VOC breath} So who is this for?
Except it's in public health and safety.
About those things.
Right.
Right.
And they have - I know they have, um -
{VOC mouthnoise} .. nurses .. in the high schools.
Oh. Well, I don't know. .. But they did when my kids were there and, um -
They were, you know real nurses who .. helped with things like that.
Alright, so we're looking for two items out of this list.
I - Uh - I don't know how I feel about neighborhood watch support. I feel like that's -
You know, the neighbors can .. watch without county money.
All they have to do is get together and do it.
Well -
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay, but if we had to take something off of this list .. and -
Yes.
I would do that.
So, we're gonna do hospital additions and neighborhood watch.
We're down to only two items, but -
I feel okay about that.
Yeah, alright. Now we're gonna look for two over here.
{NVC} So this sex ed. is gonna be for the kids. This reproductive education is for like -
Adults who don't know how to do it.
You think so?
Oh.
Okay. Alright.
Alright.
So, what are we gonna do -?
Over here, under -
Okay.
I had a kid -
Who wouldn't have finished high school without playing football.
It's something that rots your brain.
And I spent thousands of dollars .. {VOC laugh} on it. {VOC breath} So, alright, we - But we gotta come up with two things out of this list and there's nothing on this list that isn't a good thing.
I'd take out the juice machines.
Just because -
And I'd probably take out cooking classes.
Alright. .. Wh- Poetry books or cooking classes?
Oh we're not, oh, I'm willing to take out -
Yeah, so if we take out the juice machines and football we've done it.
Are we wusses cuz we could only come up with two things in each list?
We can't take out -
Custodians. Speech therapy. No. No no.
Department.
And w- Poetry.
Well -
First off, how many new poetry books do they buy every year? {VOC breath} The- Give me a break, I'm a librarian. .. They buy, maybe, ten.
It's not gonna save a nickel.
Uh- I really don't think so. In - in hind - I mean, I really think that that's a red herring kind of thing, {VOC breath} because it's so trivial in the s- in the budget of an education program.
And it's not that I don't value poetry books, but we're saving money, {VOC breath} so we can save a hundred buck. {VOC laugh}
Yeah, they're gonna have poetry books.
Well, I'm a librarian, my kids did too.
Cept the one that couldn't read til he was fifteen, but-
Okay. I c- I can live with that. {VOC breath} Although I'm willing to defer to football if you'd rather buy the books. {VOC breath} But the football could (1x) us five-thousand dollars.
Actually, we'd save a lot more money getting rid of football.
Um -
Ace Hardware.
Yeah.
Alright, so let's do football, and keep the poetry.
Yeah.
Free.
Alright.
Yes.
Hospital addition.
Neighborhood watch, was that the other one? .. Yes, and keeping veterans.
Okay.
What did we have over here?
And junior soccer, yeah.
And then under infrastructure, this was our limiting one.
And it was, yeah, gonna be and was -{VOC cough}
Taxi stops{QUAL laughing} and, uh, additional bus stops.
So we're not gonna expand anything.
Alright.
I'm content.
Okay.
Bail us out!
Oh, she turned off the light.
I know - They don't even care what we did. All they care about is our tone of voice.
Yeah.
Uh -
Uh, football equipment, I think that was a - That's an easy call.
I think that's highly .. likely.
Yeah.
And I don't believe they still - e- w- n- Roosevelt used to have cooking and sewing, even - Well - even when Michael was -
Um. .. So he would - He was born in nineteen seventy-eight.
So .. about .. nineteen ninety.
U- W- No. Not- About two thousand.
But I don't know if they still have it.

Yeah, I would too, so - {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
Um.. hm, I th- how bout.. underneath cake mix? {VOC breath}

{NVC} Yeah. That makes sense. {VOC breath} Books of matches. {NVC}
{VOC breath} Oh.
I can see needing those for camping and fishing both, but also - {VOC breath}
Oh, yeah.
Oh, okay. {VOC breath} Well, maybe it's in this catch-all, the s- sundries, cuz {VOC breath} y- you need  -
Matches in your home, too. {VOC breath} {NVC}
{VOC breath} {VOC breath} Ah! {VOC laugh} Okay. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} Thick sweaters, yes. {VOC breath} Hm, face cream. {VOC breath} That's an oddball one. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} {QUAL unsure} {VOC breath} Maybe here? Yeah. {NVC}

'Bundles {PRN mbundles} of sticks, yeah. {NVC} {NVC} {VOC breath} Rolls of duct tape. Seems hardware-ish.
Uh.. yeah.. {NVC}
Mm-hm. {NVC{ {VOC breath} Here's the hard one. Five-pound weights.
{VOC breath} Do they mean for exercising? Or for holding a tarp down {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} or - {VOC breath}

{VOC start} I think so, yeah. {NVC} {VOC breath} I've got sticks of butter, that seems like it should be refrigerated.

{VOC breath} Light jackets. {VOC breath}
Or - okay. {VOC breath} {NVC}
Mm-hm.
Mm. {QUAL lengthened}
{VOC mouthnoise} Oh -
Yeah.
{VOC breath} I think so. That's how I think of it, yeah.
Yeah. {VOC breath} Egg timers.
I kind of think it goes with, like, refrigerator 'magnets {PRN marger..nets} and stuff.. Kay. {NVC} {NVC} {VOC breath}
Uh, yeah, {QUAL lengthened} I w- I would think of.. camping or backpacking or - {VOC breath} {NVC} {VOC breath} Shoelaces.
We're running outta - {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Put it up here? Or is it -
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Yeah it w- yeah, actually it would, because that's where you find shoe polish, also.
Okay.
{NVC} {VOC start} Maybe. {QUAL whispering} {NVC} Okay.
Mm-hm. {NVC}
{VOC breath} Yeah.
{NVC} {VOC breath} {VOC breath} {VOC breath} Backpacks. Um - {VOC breath} Along here?
Cookstoves, backpacks. Okay. {NVC}
Yeah.
S- I would be inclined to put it with the rest of the hardware, but we w- that - our aisle - w- we'll have to rearrange our -
Okay. {VOC breath} {VOC breath} Yep. {VOC start} It is.
I don't know if we can reposition to make more space. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} Oh, that's legal or not {VOC breath} but -
Okay. {VOC breath}
Um, just move it up to provide space? {NVC} Okay.. Cuz I - yeah.
Cut it's - {VOC breath} it's still in its same position.
Uh - {VOC breath} {NVC} {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} Hm. {VOC breath}
'Uh - {PRN huh}
Hm.

{VOC breath} Could we -

Okay. {NVC}
Heavy coats.
Okay.
{NVC} {VOC start} Just to create a little room
Kay.
{VOC breath} Yeah.
Yeah. {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} No.. so i- okay!
We're done!
{NVC} Well that's - that's sort of a -
Camping, or sundries thing.
Might be easier if we, like, s-
Cuz she did- they didn't say that we had to do it in any order. I would say maybe start with the food items.{SIL}S- that seems to me- make more sense, because these are *hard, I don't know.. where these are gonna go.
{NVC} Cuz I - 'you know - {PRN yo} an- I don't think there was any rule that said - {NVC}
There, there's a food item. I would put that with the food items.
Sugar and ice cream.
Yeah.
Uh, we have soybeans, p- maybe here? Oh, oh I see, so we have cake mix over here.
So.. in a *real grocery store, where would the dried {QUAL laughing} figs be? I don't know. Um -
Would be with the c- so it would be the ba- flour and sugar and things like that, right?
But we can't move them.
Okay. Cuz the sugar is and the cake mix is there. *I'd put them together. {VOC breath}
{VOC start} {NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, in a real grocery store they'd be in the same aisle.
Hm? That sounds good. Cuz it - they're both sort of baking.. supplies.
Um.
{VOC breath} Well how bout this, fishing net and boating supplies? You think those make goo- make sense? Okay.
So looks (1x) like we have -
Um -
Pouches of oatmeal, okay, that would be dried - dried things. {VOC start} W- maybe with the -
(Okay, see) the problem here is th-
The *eggs, that would be w- like, with the *dairy - dairy, refrigerator. Ice cream and eggs should be together. I'd put them together, but -
{VOC breath} Um.
Well, um.. I guess it w- could go either here or here, no?
Yeah. Cuz th- the baking - baking supplies should all be together. In a *real grocery store they would be. {NVC} {NVC} {NVC} {NVC} {NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Okay.. um.. bagels.
Okay.
'Well {PRN w} why don't we put them - yeah, not really, but -
Like, there?
Okay. {NVC}
{NVC} In a real grocery store, you wouldn't have soybeans and bagels together. {VOC laugh}
Beets! Okay.
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Sure. I w- they'd go with soybeans, right? I mean - although, in rea- reality, beets would be in with the - with the produce.
'And {PRN n} soybeans would be - are dry.
Yeah, maybe if we could make a little produce aisle down there. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Okay. {NVC} {NVC} {NVC} {NVC} {NVC} Um -
{NVC} (2x) I think there were a lot of -
{NVC} Of food items, but I don't see the food items here. Th- I don't think they're - {VOC start}
Fish hooks! There we go.. There's a - there's a natural fit for fish hooks right next to the fishing net.
Mm! How bout th- with the bagels?
That would make sense, huh?
{NVC} {NVC} {NVC} {NVC} Liters of water. Do we have any -
Any, um -
Mm.. d- we don't really have anything. {NVC} Okay.
{NVC} Do we have {VOC start} f- *clothing items yet, we don't have clothing items, do we?
We need to create our own little clothing ai- where would you like to put the clothing section in this store?
We could just start (one).
Okay. {NVC} Sounds good to me. {NVC}
There we go. {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} (Like) school supplies. {VOC breath}
Mm, yeah.
Sure.
Yeah! Yeah.
Hm.
{VOC breath} Okay, that's a good one. Power cords and small saws, how about that? Hardware. {NVC} {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} Books of matches. Hm.
Mm-hm.
But 'unfortunately {PRN unforchly} we have siding.
And I- I don't think we're supposed to go above this line, that's - {VOC breath}
Sure!
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay. {NVC} Okay. {NVC}
Um - oh! Good. So, we have -
We can add to our clothing - clothing area, there. {NVC} {VOC breath} Our hats and sweaters. {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} Hm.
Y- how bout, yeah, toiletries?
Face cream would be considered a toiletry.
{NVC} Hm. {NVC}
{NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} Oh, we had something for, like -
Uh.. uh.. face cream! There we go. Face cream, bars of soap.
These are gonna gonna get - *hopefully get easier as we get more on the board. {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} Oh, um.. how bout right there? {NVC}
{NVC} Yeah. Yeah, this should - oh, c- scissors! Scissors would go with school supplies, wouldn't it?
(Like), books of matches and loose-leaf paper?
Mm-hm, again, toiletries.
Mm-hm. {QUAL quiet} {NVC}
{NVC} Half-inch - {NVC} {VOC start} {NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} Socks! Boy, I'm getting easy ones here. {VOC breath} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Tow ropes. That would be hardware.
Our hardware section is either gonna be maybe in here, or down here? {VOC start}
I don't know.. What do you think?
Right there? {NVC}
Yeah, that makes sense. {VOC breath} {NVC}
{NVC} Mm-hm. {NVC} Packages of cookies. We had some food here, didn't we?
Sugar! {VOC breath} Sugar.. Sugar and ice cream and packages of cookies. That's where all the kids are gonna hang out, right up there. {VOC breath}
Mm, okay.
We haven't -
Gotten, like, gardening supplies yet.
Mousetraps, yeah.
M- m- but that's - that's - {VOC start} you'd - you'd expect to find those, like, at a Lowe's, or.. {VOC mouthnoise} Home Depot, right?
Yeah. {NVC} Yeah.
{NVC} {VOC breath} {NVC} {NVC} Mm-hm, mm-hm.
{NVC} 'It's {PRN ts} always good when I find one that's - that's obvious. {VOC breath}
Fleece-lined boots. {NVC} {NVC} To go with the socks and thick sweaters.
{VOC start} Camping? {VOC breath}
But did we have a camping area yet?
Not really.
Fishing.
{VOC mouthnoise} (Well) we *know -
{VOC start} From the list that there's some camping supplies, right?
In - in there somewhere.
Travel guides. Sure, why not.
{NVC} Sure.
Bottles of juice. That should be pretty easy, huh?
Um.
{VOC mouthnoise} Eggs are sorta down there by themself. That makes sense because I- (??) refrigerated.
So you wouldn't -
You wouldn't -
Cuz the ice cream and the eggs make sense. Those would be together.
Um.
{VOC breath} How bout if we put it right.. here? Then we sort of.. hedge our bets, we might have something better there.
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Mm-hm.. yep. That's where I woulda put it. {VOC breath} {NVC} Woops! {NVC} 'Oh, that's {PRN /as/} okay! That's okay. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} {NVC} {VOC laugh} Clean up, right. That's appropriate for what we're doing. {NVC} {VOC breath} {NVC}
That's okay. {VOC breath} They're all gonna get put up anyway. Bundles of sticks.
{VOC breath} {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} {QUAL breathing out with a /f/} Yeah, why not? Right here.
Right here. Sure. {NVC}
Mm, food?
Sure.
That sounds good. {VOC breath}
Hm.
{NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} Electric heaters.
Here maybe?
Or here.
Which - which do you think is more appropriate?
Okay.
{NVC} Yeah.
{NVC} {NVC} Mm-hm.
{NVC} {NVC} Yep. {NVC} {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Oh I already have one - good one. Chocolate bars. I'd put them maybe up with the sugar and the cookies. And the *doughnuts.
Bagels. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Large vests, I'm gonna put that here with the - with.. clothing. {VOC breath} {NVC}
Large cups. Okay, that would be, like -
Yeah!
Sure! That would be, 'like, {PRN thlike} the dry goods.. {VOC start} Cups and plates an-
{VOC breath} Kay, pre-cut wood, I'm -
Be inclined to maybe put that *here, along with the bundles of *sticks.
Mm.. Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. {NVC}
{VOC breath} {NVC} {NVC} Wetsuits. Now that's gonna be -
{VOC mouthnoise} I woulda put it here, but we have siding here.
How bout if we put it here - ?
Because.. in a way.. cookstoves, wetsuits, boating supplies.
Yeah, because -
{VOC breath} I would.. guess five-pound 'weights - {PRN long s} {VOC start} They're - that's m- that's too much for, like, a fishing weight, so I would have to guess it's, like, 'a {PRN lengthened} dumbbell for.. weightlifting kinda thing.
Yeah.
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Okay. {NVC}
Mm-hm.
Unfortunately, I don't know where books might go. Where would books go? Toys, maybe?
Maybe right here?
Right there. {NVC} {NVC}
Definitely. Eggs an- absolutely. Absolutely.
{VOC breath} Liters of water.
Do we have any other - oh bottles of juice! There we go.
Oh, how bout right there?
{NVC} These are gonna get harder. Tweezers.
Uh, do we - where are the scissors?
How bout right here?
Well this would be more toiletries, right?
{VOC mouthnoise} I think it would - yeah, you're right, it would go here, wouldn't it? It would go with the toi- the small toiletries.
Mm-hm. Mm-hm, a- refrigerator magnets.. cups, yep.
Okay, the box cutter. Box cutting knives. Um.
Here?
{NVC} Okay.
Shoelaces.
Um, well, in a - in a - I'm thinking, in a real grocery store, wouldn't the shoelaces be in, like, this kind of an area?
Or not?
Sort of shoe polish, tweezers -
Yeah.. I th- and just - thinking about a *real grocery store, I think that's where they'd be. {VOC breath} {VOC breath} Cushions for deck chairs. Hm. {VOC breath}
Now that's a hard one, because we don't really have -
Well, what about somewhere in here?
Backpacks.
Yeah.. Sure, sure, that's a good spot for it right there.
{NVC} {VOC start} Buckets.
{VOC breath} Hm. {VOC breath}
(1x) we have all the food over there.. so it's not gonna fit there.
Buckets.
Mm-hm.
{VOC breath} Our aisle is - is - has been used up. I guess {QUAL long s} the rule was once we put it down we can't move it.
'Was - {PRN uz} wasn't that the rule?
Okay. {VOC breath} {VOC start}
{VOC mouthnoise} Well, I think the rule was i- w- what i- w- if it was already there we couldn't move it.. But I think we can move our own stuff.
Yeah, I think we -
I think so.. I think so. I don't think that's -
Inappropriate.
{NVC} Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Yeah, we're just making room for one more. {VOC breath} {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Empty plastic jugs. {VOC breath}
That's sort of a -
Could go -
{VOC start} I would argue that {NVC} one might be something like camping supplies or something.
But we've - we've sorta run outta space for camping supplies.
{NVC} Kay.
Okay. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} {VOC breath} {VOC start} Cr- we're - we're - we have a - yeah. Heavy cable. Again, (now). We're sort of heavy on the hardware.
{NVC} {VOC breath} 'Yeah. {PRN nyeah}
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Well - {VOC breath}
It sounds like we need to create another section {QUAL whispering on 'tion'}.
Because otherwise we're - {VOC start} {VOC start} without moving things -
We have - we have room here. Why don't we just start sort of a catch all.. category here? {VOC breath}
Okay, unfortunately, that's w- the heavy coats belongs here, so let's move - {VOC breath} {NVC} let's move this. {NVC} M- make a little room.
There. {NVC}
(Now), it *should have it's own section. I mean, really.
Is it - the wine and things usually gets its own section, right?
You don't put it with - with other things, so - it gets its own section. Okay, we're done! {VOC breath}
Yeah.
{VOC breath} Is there anything in the first column that {VOC breath} you think should go? I - {VOC start} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} I honed in on acting coaches. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh. {QUAL lengthened}
{VOC breath} | Uh - {VOC laugh} I think so, yeah. | {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Mm-kay. {VOC breath}
Mm-hm. {VOC breath}
'Yeah. {PRN hyeah}
Yeah. That would be easy for me to cut.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah. {VOC breath} {VOC breath} Okay. {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} What is a public access statio- {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} um - {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} Do they mean *television, or radi- ? Yeah. {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} Oh, like a community center? {VOC breath} Maybe. {VOC breath}
Mm.
{VOC breath} {VOC breath} | Yeah. {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} Yeah. The - the other one that I *think would be {VOC breath} easy for me to cut would be the 'community {PRN communy} news - 'yeah. {PRN eah}

Mm-hm. {VOC breath} Mm-hm. {VOC breath}
Mm-hm. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} | Right.
Mm-hm.

Which would be great, but why is the city pay- {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Yeah. {VOC breath}
Yeah.
Okay. {QUAL whispering on 'kay'}
{VOC breath} {VOC breath} Yep. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} We're done! {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay, so.
We can be generous and not - {NVC} you know.. cut three or four things.
Mm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Acting coaches. Yeah. {VOC breath}
{VOC start} Note- (1x) see, cook- classes, {QUAL muttering} acting coaches. {QUAL whispering} {VOC breath} I would say that acting coaches - I mean, I know the School of Drama would disagree with us, but I really don't see how.. public funds should be spent on acting coaches. {VOC breath}
'Oh, I {PRN /ojai/} assume this is a city department, right? This is - {QUAL muttering} we're - we're essentially working for a city. {VOC breath} I think an acting coach is some- something that could be cut.
{VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Okay, so we're cutting one there at least.. Okay. Second column.. Um -
Hm.
I'm not quite sure how weed control is a public health issue. I mean, if there's too many weeds in public areas, how does that jeopardize people's health? | {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}
I would too. You know, I could argue that {VOC breath} {VOC start} if it's in a play area with *children, {VOC breath} you don't want toxic {VOC mouthnoise} weed killers all over the grass anyway, if they're *playing on the grass.
So *I would say no to the weed control. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Okay, 'recreation {PRN racreation} and public services. {VOC breath} Um - {VOC breath}
I don't know!
A public *access station.
I- I - that's {VOC start} the only thing I can think is a public access - {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} would that be, like, a.. {QUAL lengthened} place where you would go to get information about your community services or something? {NVC}
Like a - like a - a community center? Where they would have - {VOC start} {VOC start} literature and handouts, like, for instance, voting pamphlets and things like that, you would get normally at a library?
{VOC mouthnoise} Since - since neither one of us knows what a public access station is, I think we could {QUAL laughing} probably cut it. {VOC breath} Unless somebody can.. tell us what it is. {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} | Mm-hm?
Community news ads, yeah. I agree. Like, one of these - these {VOC breath} circulars that you get on your doorstep.. f- that's full of ads and nothing much {VOC start} else except ads. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Okay. So, we d- we're doing, um -
{VOC mouthnoise} Acting coaches, weed control, and public access station.. Okay, infrastructure and licensing. {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Well, this is gonna show my bias, but what about tattoo artist licenses? {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} I'm not a big fan of tattoos. {VOC breath}
But, there again, it's a -
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Well - okay, I'm gonna b- 'I'm gonna.. {PRN Imuhnuh} {VOC start} back - backtrack. {VOC breath} I think tattoo artists *should be licensed, because it means that they're up to.. standards. Public health standards, so I - I will - I'm gonna g- back - back - go back on that. I think they *should be licensed.
I would.. hate to think that they're *unlicensed, 'and {PRN n} their - their.. equipment is - is not - not hygienic. {VOC breath} Um, so, how bout - ? Yeah, massage certificates.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm!
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
{VOC breath} Why is the *city paying to *certify massage therapists?
{VOC start} For the same reason, why are they.. paying for the, uh - {VOC breath} acting coaches?
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay. So, we picked one from each column.
{VOC mouthnoise} I think we're done!
.. Paper, there we go.
And shoe laces.
'Uh{PRN long}, no.
So, what do you think? Buckets over with -?
Containers or with -?
Outdoor type -
Okay.
This seems like sporting goods, the five pound weights.
Small saws.
Yeah, uh, tweezers I had.. with that.
Socks.
Rolls of duct tape.
Precut wood.
Mint toothpaste.
Is there a kitchen supplies type area?
Egg timers?
See that's kind of - The scissors -
'Sure.{PRN long /sh/}
Would you put a- empty plastic jugs with here?
Bags of peat moss, that's kind of outdoor.
Yeah, that's definitely outdoor stuff.. I feel like I'm re- reorganizing Fred Meyer.
{VOC mouthnoise} Sure, miscellaneous.
Alright, so where do we start here?
Do we wanna s-
Do wanna go here to there or -?
Well this is -
Yeah, dairy-ish so -
Our cold stuff would be -
Sticks of butter.
Bottles of juice might be refrigerated.
Think this'll be our dairy type items.
So butter goes typically with dairy in a grocery store.
Sure.
The bottles of jui- {VOC breath} Bottles of juice goes next to sticks of butter.
Sure let's put the liters - Was that? The liters of water -
So this - This aisle seems like this a food aisle.
So sugar would be baking items -
Yeah, that's true, so chocolate bars, {VOC breath}pouches of oatmeal -
I think -
Packages of cookies, those are all baked goods.
Let's see here, so -
Cake mix.. is a -
Introduction to baked goods.
We could put those things together.
Pa. Well, the three of these things are made, so packages of cookies, boxes of donuts, and bagels.
Mmhm.
The dried figs.
Sure, that works for me.
No, it doesn't really matter to me, so -
How bout pa- packages of cookies on .. top.
Sure.
And then was it boxes of donuts?
Yeah, that one works.. and then bagels?
Okay.{QUAL muttering}
Wanna put the chocolate bars be-
The dried figs, the chocolate bars and pouches of oatmeal? That works for me.
Not really, okay, so -
First one how bout -?
Chocolate bars next to cake mix?
Pouches of oatmeal and then dried figs -
{VOC mouthnoise} The soy beans?
Yeah. {VOC breath} {VOC laugh}
Uh, how bout soy beans, then cans of peas? .. 'That{PRN zat} work?
And beets.
And then the cases of whiskey -?
Oh, we can fill it in later. .. I still like the idea of putting that next to toys.
So, refrigerator magnets, I think that would be a good - Uh, egg timers would be good thing to put with that.
It doesn't mater to me.. which way -
Actua- If we put it above it has more space.
'Doesn't really matter.{PRN muttering}
And then we've got toilet paper so -
We have a whole bathroom section
Let's see, we've got bars of soap {NVC} mint toothpaste, face cream, and tweezers.
Let's fill in between toilet paper and refrigerator magnets.
The tweezers.
Sure.
Small- Small metal.
{VOC mouthnoise} Then the face cream, okay.
Sure.
Then the mint toothpaste.
Squeeze it in.
Sure.
We squeeze that in there.
Okay, so what's our next aisle look like? We got pet food and toys.
Yep.
Yeah books (1x), that works.
Yeah.{QUAL laughing}
That's true.
I don't care.{QUAL laughing}
I actually don't even like whiskey.
Um,{VOC laugh} we could put the b- Let's put the books and toys together.
Those are things that my son likes to strew all over the house.
Scissors.
I imagine like the big red dixie cups you see the college kids drinking w- out of.
We could put them down here.
The toilet paper and the cups and loose leaf paper.
Sure.
Yeah, that works. So we've got scissors, loose leaf paper, large cups, and toilet paper.
I think we've got a big section here where we can put clothing.
So, what I would do is I would take backpacks out.
Um, so heavy coats and, like -
Heavy coats -
Light jackets, large vests -
Thick sweaters, yeah.
All the accessory type things, if we have to for r- room purposes.
Yeah, so -
Heavy coats, light.. I don't really care about order, do you have a  preference? Seems like outerwear.
Then.. clothing.
Okay.
{VOC mouthnoise} Let's go from toys to {NVC} outerwear.
So heavy coats -
Then the light jackets -
Then large vests. I'll hand these to you.
And thick sweaters.
How we doing? Looks like we've got lots of space there. {VOC breath} So then I think we should do -
Um -
Hats?
Then thinking we should go toward feet. {NVC}
So, probably -
Let's put the shoelaces and the hats together because those are -
Accessory type items.{VOC breath} Socks, fleece lined boots.
Okay.
That works.
I think it looks pretty good like that.
{VOC laugh} Should we just pick an arbitrary spot?
Tween bagels and soybeans? {VOC laugh}
Ah.
Maybe just way up here.
Okay, so looking at these items -
We've got -
Yeah, and that's water -
So, wetsuits, tow ropes, fish hooks -
Fishing net -
The firewood type things are bundles of sticks, axes -
That's more kind of camping -
Books of matches -
This would be kind of a camping type thing, electric heaters?
Heavy cable -
Gas powered cook stoves -
Yeah, I would say cushions for deck chairs, kind of camp-
Sure, let's camping area.
I'll put buckets and empty plastic jugs together.
More type of supply type things, so half inch tubing, duct tape -
I might put that with the axes.
And the saws.
These are kind of our miscellaneous items.
Bags of peat moss, not sustainable, five pound weights, and heavy cable.
Yeah, so -
So we've got boating supplies. Uh la la- Boating supplies, {VOC breath} we could put our wetsuits, tow ropes, fishhooks, and fishing net near the boating supplies.
Yeah, we don't really have any.
Well, the cable and -
Sure.
So let's do our - Let's place our boating supplies type things first.
I don't have any preference. Uh, so.. tow ropes because those go -
With boating supplies.
And the 'fish{PRN long f}- Fishing net  and fishing hooks probably together.
Sure. {VOC laugh}
How - P.. How bout above tow ropes?
{VOC breath} Okay, so power cords -
{VOC breath} I would say electric heaters.
Uh, this is -
And ha- Actually we could put heavy cable with -
So if we wanted to -
We could do power chords, heavy cable, electric heaters -
And stoves.
Sure.
Yeah, that works.
And then gas powered cook stoves?
And you've got cushions for du- deck chairs.
Where do we wanna put those backpacks? .. How bout we put the backpacks here between fleece lined boots and pet food?
Alright.
We should put our travel guides with our books.
Or the whiskey.
So we're starting to see some -
{NVC} More outdoorsy type things, bags of peat moss, {VOC breath} You know but five pound weights we could probably put with fishing net
I don't fish, so I don't know.
So are mouse traps.
No.
Let's go from mouse traps. Let's go down from there.
And put all of our -
Cutting, and kitchen things on fire implements.
(Now) put the sticks and the wood together.
Sure.
So, mouse traps, box knives -
And the books of matches.
All those things are flammable.. {VOC laugh} Except for the box knives.
Let's put those above mouse trap, yeah.
No.
And I'm gonna go below.. books of matches if that's okay.
ba- th- .. Bags of peat moss.
I'm thinking flammability.
Bundles of sticks and precut wood.
So above mouse traps we have the small saws and the small axes.
And then, we've got four left.
I think we're gonna go over here in this -
Last aisle we've got some good -
{VOC breath} Let's - {VOC breath} Let's go up from cushions for deck chairs.
How bout you c- so you can repair your cushions with rolls of duct tape.
S- Once you see the price and decide you don't want brand new cushions you can get a roll of duct tape.
{VOC breath} How bout tubing?
And then empty plastic jugs?
Sure, and then buckets.
Bait.
Uh. Ugh.
I don't like beets. My son likes them.
Yeah.
{VOC breath} Uh, he's been eating them since he was one.
Yeah, so we're all done.
He ate, um - What's the Russian dish?
He likes borscht.
I don't like beets {NVC} they're too earthy for me-
Paper, so -
No, just put it there for now. Hats obviously with the clothing.
Axes, is the wood out yet?
(2x).. We can go with box knives for now.
Oh, buckets seem more, uh, outdoorsy to me, {VOC breath} and tow ropes do too.
See, is there a bathroom -? Oh, there's soap.
Um. {VOC breath}
Maybe the cups?
Could be with the food. I don't know.
Oh, probably with out-
Doorsy stuff.
Um, this might go with food. I don't really see anything else it would go with.
These -
Books - I don't know. Well, we can leave that -
Aside.. So -
Well, we see sugar and.. cake mix, um -
Or do you wanna?
Well, let's 'go{PRN long vowel} - Well, let's see. That's dairy-ish, right?
Butter.
Bottles of juice could - could be.
Is there anything else?
Alright. Um, well -
Yeah.
Uh, well there's gonna end up being a gap. We can't move that. {VOC mouthnoise}
But that's frozen and this isn't, so I guess we can put this here?
So, bottles of juice -
To sticks of butter, and eggs. Mm-kay, let's see.
Well, water could *go next to juice.
Liters of water.
Next to juice.
See if there's any other food up here.. Soybeans, sugar.
Yeah.
Which would - I mean - This c- I often find chocolate near baking in stores or some reason.
Yeah, that's - That could go - Um -
The cookies and the.. donuts could be on the other side of the cake mix, or something.
Yeah, an-
'Soybeans{PRN muttering}, um - {NVC}
It's kind of its own thing.
Oh.
Not finished products could go between it and sugar. Is that what you're thinking? .. I mean not - Not these cuz those are made and those are made, or what are you thinking?
These are made.
So these *are already baked.
And these are two things.
That could go into the baking along with - .. Yeah.
Have an egg timer there.
Uh, figs can go in baked stuff too.
We could put the, uh -
The - .. f- .. The baked stuff on this side of the cake mix, below it.
Do you have any -?
Order; cookies, donuts, bagels?
So here?
Below the cake mix.
Probably next, boxes of donuts?
And {NVC} bagels.
Alright.
Let's see.
So -
Between the sugar -
And the cake mix. It would make sense - Well, I think *these three would make sense, the figs, chocolate, and oatmeal. What do you think?
Or is that?
Yeah.
Do you have a order preference?
Alright.
Okay.. Um -
Beats and peas. So we have those beans that are there and we can't move them.
Um -
Would you wanna just put those on either side of it? I don't see any other food. There's liquor.. but -
Yeah.
Okay.
Might be able to leave those for -
Yeah.
{VOC laugh} .. Um -
Oh, that's probably true.. Should we put it under?
Okay, we'll put it under.. egg timers - Oh -
Hasn't stuck yet.
Okay, above.
Egg timers above refrigerator magnets?
Um, soap, face cream, mint.. toothpaste.
Tweezers, um -
We going *up or down?
Do you think?
So I can see this going under refrigerator magnets, cuz they're small, and - You know.. M- Okay. T-
Tweezers under magnets, and then these three.
So, you want face cream next?
Face cream{QUAL muttering} below tweezers.
Then -
The mint toothpaste.{QUAL muttering} {NVC} .. And then below the mint toothpaste the bars of soap -
(??) Toilet paper, alright.
Hm.
And there's not much room above toys.. You could put books above toys maybe.
I'm just looking for something that doesn't go with anything else.
I mean you could put the whiskey up there. {VOC laugh} It's not like we're doing this as a, uh,  business school project. So, do you want the whiskey next to the toy?{QUAL laughing}
Okay, above the toys? The books above the toys?
Kay.
Oh. {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath}'Um{PRN long} I mean I guess these go. What kind of cups *are these?
Oh, yeah.
Put em next to egg timers, I mean just - .. Or - .. Or next to the toilet pa- Yeah, you often see that, just with paper goods and stuff.
Oh, yeah. So maybe the -
Cups as a buffer? .. Or something?
Large cups.
Loose leaf paper {NVC} below large cups and scissors below, um -
Mm-hm. {VOC mouthnoise} Uh, let's see.
Clothes.
(What)? {QUAL muttering} ..Yeah, and it doesn't look like there is any other.. clothing up, so - {VOC breath}
Mmhm.
Socks and shoe laces together.
Mm-kay, so these.. first.
Yeah.
We could.. start with the outerwear, I guess. Next to the toys, going down, or -?
Or pet food, going up? I don't -
Okay, heavy coats, light.. jackets.
Kay.
Mm-kay.
Sure.
This could actually go with outdoorsy stuff.. too,
Um -
If there's nothing that's gonna be.. well - {VOC breath}
Yeah, and I was just thinking, where's that whiskey gonna go? .. Um -
Yeah, I mean I guess it should be near s- Well -
Should be near some sorta - I don't know. Maybe it should be back.. In the back.
You know.
Okay.
Yeah.
Well, here's -  I mean this is water, right?
And that's water.
Is there any other? Oh, fishing net -
So those go together.
(That) - Yeah.
Wood.
Saws.
This kind of camping? I mean it's really - So.. Is this the camping?
Backpacks should go there too then.
Um, duct tape.
Yeah.
Box knives, 'something{PRN long nasal}
Okay, that makes sense. Cuts, and then cable.
'Uh.{PRN long}
So, I don't know. (1x) Go up there, or -?
Yeah, it could just be miscellaneous, I guess.
So we have four -
Boat related things.
Yeah.
Mmhm.
And siding is, you know, construction related. That.. kinda looks -
Well, axes.. Um -
I mean, they could be like -
Cable, tubing.. tape.
Um -
{NVC} Kay. 'Um{PRN NVC running through} - {NVC}
Kay, we'll put that above the - .. supplies. We have net, wetsuit, and fishhooks.
Oh yeah. Um -
Put the fish hooks, cuz they're small next to the supplies.
{VOC laugh}.. And then the nets below there.
And the wetsuits. {NVC}
Okay, wetsuits above tow ropes.
Oh, right. Let's see.
Heaters and stoves could go.
Next to the{QUAL whispering} power chords I guess.
And stoves.
Going up.. or - So, power cords, heavy cable.
Above it?
Electric heaters above.. {NVC} *that.
(Put) stoves above that.
Desk chairs above.. cook stoves.
Um.
Yeah.
Sure, that'll work.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Five pound weights under a net.
U- .. Are there any tools up there?
Not.. really but - Well, there's boating stuff, but.. other than that -
See -
Okay, um -
Well, these are small.
These are small.
So these - I would say these should come after mousetraps cuz they're small like mousetraps.
Books of matches.
Next -
Or-
Maybe the knives next - The box knives.. below the mousetraps, and the books of matches below the -
Box knives.
Oh.
Um.
And then small saws and small axes.. maybe? Or are we running outta -? Oh, going up?
Okay.
{NVC} Um, I'll put the saws first unless you.. care.. So, small saws above mousetraps, small axes above small saws -
Oh yeah, for the.. bulkier things.
Yeah.
M-
Alright.
Little sort of utilitarian things.
Do we want to go down from the power cords, or up, or on both sides, or -
Sure.
And then tubing.. or one of those. I don't know.
Alright.. tubing above duct tape.
You can put your bait in it, I guess.
Bait.. as well.
Well, that's a pretty funny looking store, but - .. It makes some sense.
There's just lots of empty aisles. {VOC laugh}
Beets.
I like beats.
Really?
You have a two year old who likes beets?
Oh.
So, um, I suppose we're done.
Borscht.
Oh, I do too. Grew up on it.
I would say find one in each.. first.
That we agree can be removed.
Okay, in education programs -
Math tutors, assistant cooks, sex ed., custodians, speech therapy, football equipment -
Acting coaches, poetry books, special ed. teachers -
Cooking classes, note takers, disability services -
Sugar free juice machines, bookkeeping classes, and music teachers.
The low hanging fruit for me is the sugar free juice machines.
Alright.
Reproductive education -
Job training programs, chicken pox vaccinations - I'm a big vaccination believer.
They seem - Well they seem the same to me.. So, it seems like we c- That invasive species removal {VOC breath} and weed control are redundant.
Um -
Yeah, so let's take weed control out of public health and safety, and leave the invasive species removal. {VOC breath} Um -
Sex Oben- Sex offender database, the veterans medical assistance -
Prenatal check-ups, and neighborhood watch support, those all seem important.
Um{QUAL breathy} -
Along with hospital - Hospital additions, and needle exchange, so let's m- leave those for now.
Mm-hm.
Oh,  those are -
I wonder if those are those marketing support programs y- you go into a restroom and see a -
Um, does your partner beat you sign.
I'm guessing that's what that is. Foodbanks are essential.
Yeah.{QUAL laughing}
I think is critical.
It needs to stay.
Uh, foodbank is very important.. item for public services.
Think should stay. The veterinary hospital -
I would be inclined to get rid of the boys basketball club because you don't see a girls basketball club.
Is not gender specific, so it - Leave that.
{VOC breath} The stadium upkeep?
The boys can play in the basketball - They find a good cul-de-sac.
Teaching certificates.
The tattoo artist licenses.
The drainage ditches need to stay. Um, public bus us- upkeep.
Fishing licenses, I think are fine.
Taxi stops.. meh.
Massage certificates - I would say the towing services.
Why is the city paying for that?
Or the county?
So hunting tags can stay. Subway system -
Go lightrail.
Um, pothole maintenance
That definitely needs to stay.. Um, boating licenses, tattoo artist licenses -
Additional bus stops.
{VOC mouthnoise} Speed limit signs.
Um, I would say get rid of the towing services.
It's n- right next to the - .. the bus and the train station.
I don't know how much -
I don't know. It's only about four spots worth.
Not even in a high density area.
'Was it?{PRN muttering} Yeah, the weed control.
Okay, so we've gotten rid of one in each category. Do we want to go for a second?
Well they have -
In public health and safety, there's the reproductive education, and the S_T_D_ education.
Assuming those are the same thing. We could get rid of -
Yes.
Let's get rid of the -
Acting coaches.
In education and programs.
Sure.
Oh, did we pick one in there already? I was kidding about math tutors.
I still have my eye on that community news ads.
Yeah, but then they're - all things being equal.
'Public{PRN no /l/} drainage ditches, we need.
We could get rid of those, um, taxi stops.
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay.
Alright, so we've cut -
We've cut two from each one.
Yeah.
If we increase the stray cat spaying, we won't need any of the kitty adoption.
Increase the dog catcher. {VOC laugh}
Okay, think we're done.
How do you wanna attack this?
'Um.{PRN NVC in the middle}
Like.. category by category or -?
Okay.. Tsk.
{VOC breath} Yeah, well -
I - I hate cutting education, but let's see here, um -
Hm. Hm-hm.
Well, I can think of - So, we -There's some things you just can't cut, so -
You need to keep the school clean, so you can't cut the custodians.
Uh, special edu- Special ed teachers are probably a federal requirement, and.. so are note takers for disabled kids, so those three are safe I think.
Yeah, I would say if I had to.. axe on of these it would probably be that.
So, yeah sugar free juice machines are out.
Um. Tsk.
Public health, hate to cut there too, but let's see.
Training -
Tsk. Invasive species removal, S_T_D_ education, toxic waste.. disposal, hospital additions -
Needle exchange, sex offender database, veteran's medical assistance, prenatal heck-ups, and neighborhood watch support.. I -
Don't know about you, but - Um -
Uh, the invasive - The invasive species or weed control is the one - I don't know which one, but I'd -
Yeah.
Uh- So we kill one of them and.. let the other program take up the slack, or -?
Okay.
Okay.
That sounds good, so - We've killed one in the first two -
Recreation, stray cat spaying -
Community news ads.. I don't even really know what that is. Um -
I mean, I know what community news *is, but what -? What do the mean by the ads?
Oh.
Oh, okay.
That should be under public health. Um -
Junior soccer league, kitten puppy adoptions, soup kitchens -
Housing assistance, dog catcher, boys basketball club, public access T_V_ , public access station, veterinary hospital, football stadium upkeep -
And pest control. Well.. Um -
As long as not upkeeping the football stadium doesn't mean it falls to bits -
And it only means it gets, you know, a little old.
Mm. That's true.
Killing the stadium upkee- keep to add a girls, but anyway -
Uh, we can - Sure, let's kill the basketball club. We can -
Play, uh -
Basketball.. somewhere else I guess.
Yeah, okay. So, infrastructure and licensing, teaching certificates -
Speed limit signs, additional bus stops -
Tattoo artist licenses, boating licenses -
Pothole maintenance, subway system, hunting tags -
towing services, massage certificates, taxi stops?
Fishing licenses, public bus upkeep, and drainage ditches. Well -
You can't really -
Dispense with teaching certificates.
And the speed limit signs do too.
Um -
Yeah, I'm not really sure why this city is -
Doing that.
Or whatever the- Oh, it's a county. Yeah, um -
Yeah, I'd probably axe the towing services.
Yeah.
Yeah, if we're just getting rid of one I would say , um -
Um.. Axe the taxi stops. I'm not every sure what the city is doing.
Oh, right.
Now, I forgot we'd agreed on that. I'm still not sure what the city's doing, or the county's doing with taxi stops, but - Um - .. Yeah, towing services is - can go first.
Mm.
Or maybe it's lost parking revenue or something.
Okay.. So -
So we got rid of the towing services, the boys basketball.. club, the.. weed control?
The sugar free juice machines it looks like.
Um -
I don't know if we need to.
Oh yeah. That's redundant.
I'd say get rid of S_T_D_ since it should be covered in reproductive.
Um -
Where are they?
Oh, we're getting rid of another one there?
Okay.
Okay, well you never know. Um - {VOC laugh} Oh, yeah acting coaches. That's fine.
Um -
Public services - I still have my eye on that stadium.
Oh yeah. What -? .. Oh the public -
S- stadium would save more money.
That's true. Alright, news ads it is.. And.. What about licensing?
Yeah, I'm for that. {VOC mouthnoise} Kill the taxi stops.
Oh, that's eight programs.
Alright.
Guess that's it.
And hope it was enough.
Money saved.
Oh yeah, that's true still would need the .. puppy adoptions though.
Hm.
Um, {QUAL lengthened} so I'll let you take the lead on this, since apparently you've worked groceries.
Um, so I guess the first one we have is -
Yeah. {QUAL breathy} {VOC breath} Yeah. {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} Do you think it should go next to toilet paper?
Okay. {NVC} {VOC breath}
Um, {QUAL lengthened} {VOC breath} so, books of matches.
Next to magnets? Yeah, I would. {NVC}
Um, {VOC breath} socks? {NVC}
I don't.. think so.
Yeah. {NVC} .. Is that good?
{VOC breath} Um, five-pound weights.
I'd say s- somewhere over here. Yeah, sure. {VOC breath}
Um, {NVC} empty plastic jugs.
Maybe next to travel guides? Cuz, you need - {VOC mouthnoise}
(1x)? Is that good here?
{NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} Um, heavy coats. Next to socks? {QUAL trailing off}
Um, pouches of oatmeal. {VOC breath}
There's only *one side to each - or, I guess there's two sides.
Like, here?
{NVC} 'Kay. {PRN k}
{VOC breath} {NVC} {VOC start} Um.. fish hooks.
Um, bundles of sticks. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} I think we can put it in the outdoor - it'll be *bigger, too, and I feel like it should go on the side.
Um, scissors? {VOC breath}
Like, up here?
Um, cans of peas. {VOC breath}
{VOC start} Um, sticks of butter.
{NVC} Uh, dried figs. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC start} Yeah, people like dried fruit in their oatmeal.
Um, large vests. Next to heavy coats.
Um, gas-powered cookstoves.
Yeah.
Um, fishing net.
{NVC} {VOC breath} {VOC breath} Yeah. Um, thick sweaters. {VOC breath}
Uh, toys. {QUAL rising intonation} {VOC breath}
I think this is fine, in the middle.
Um, tow ropes, probably down here. {VOC breath} {NVC}
Small saws. {VOC breath} {NVC}
Tools over here, maybe?
Um, mint toothpaste.
Boxes of doughnuts?
'Oh, {PRN ope} sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay, bottles of juice. {QUAL rising intonation}
Sh- do we wanna put *drinks up here?
{VOC start} Um, face cream? {VOC breath}
Maybe with the toothpaste?
{VOC start} Um, hats. {VOC breath}

Feel like weed control -
Maybe hospital additions? I mean, 'that's so {PRN that th'o} vague, I don't really know what that means, so -
I'm an environmentalist, so I would keep that. {VOC start} But I would maybe get rid of neighborhood watch support.

{VOC mouthnoise} 'Yeah, {PRN nyeah} I cou-

{VOC mouthnoise} Alright. {QUAL high pitched} We're done. {VOC laugh}

Okay. Um, I would cut the juice machines.
Um -
And then - {VOC breath}
Poetry books, and then probably -

So, poetry, football, and sugar-free juice machines. Okay.

I 'don't {PRN don} think we w- dog catcher -
I don't know. My dogs have never run away. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}

Yeah, I think that's kind of just, like, being like, this what's going on our community. And then nobody ever reads them and they just kinda sit there. {QUAL laughing}
Yeah. Um.. I mean.. I don- I prefer soccer over football, so.. I would prefer to keep the junior soccer league over the football stadium.

That could go with the 'food{PRN NVC in middle}.
Face cream.
They can go somewhere in that aisle.
That could be like, down here somewhere or up here.
(They could be) near toys. It's like a school supplies.
Or magnets. {VOC laugh} Yeah like{QUAL laughing}, alls the random things you have in your house.

Next to oatmeal?

Near toys?
Yeah.
I think we did okay.
Empty plastic jugs. Um - .. Tsk.
I - .. I guess so, it seems kind of outdoorsy, doesn't it?  I mean - .. Um -
Depends on what the empty plastic jugs are being used for.{QUAL laughing}
Yeah.. Face cream. N- Probably next to toilet paper, (um) -
(??) Yeah. {VOC cough}
Thick sweaters, um -
Maybe next -
Yeah.
That would make sense.
Pouches of oatmeal.
'Uh{PRN long} -
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise}{VOC breath} Let's go with that.
Uh - {VOC breath} I think I'll go with the siding thing here. This is - {VOC breath}
Pre-cut wood. Rolls of duct tape, they seem like home -
Fleece lined boots. Well we can put those next to the thick sweaters
Um. {NVC}
Oh yeah, true.
Rolls of duct tape.
Hmm.
Next to mouse traps, maybe? I don-
Okay.
Electric heaters.
'Um.{PRN long}

Tow 'ropes{PRN long /s/}
(1x) Okay.
Empty plastic jugs, let's put it next to{QUAL laughing} that maybe.
Or (??) .. (I don't know.)
Um.
Well, it should probably be like in here, I guess.
Yeah.
Maybe I'm grabbing more than I should. Loose leaf paper. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Um -
That doesn't seem to go anywhere. Liters of water.
Uh -
Yeah.
Mm, what aisle{QUAL muttering} though?
Well, mint toothpaste, that seems pretty -
(1x) Yeah.
Oops.
Large cups.{QUAL whispering}
This aisle is getting neglected. {VOC laugh}
Okay, sure. Um - Let's be non-committal and put it in the middle.
(1x) Liters of water and bottles of juice.
Let's just put it down here.{QUAL muttering}
Loose leaf paper, still.
(1x) Yeah. {VOC breath} (1x)
(But), yeah.
Books of matches.
Mm.

We are running out of space here. {VOC laugh}
That's true.

{VOC breath} Hats.

Bags of peat moss.
Gas powered cook stoves.. Where did we put electric heaters again?
Okay, how bout right there?
Yeah.
Heavy cable.{QUAL muttering} {VOC breath} Sure. Go with it. {VOC laugh}
Okay. Yeah.
Let's put it next to refrigerator magnets.{QUAL laughing}
Bagels.
Um -
Yeah.
Though we only have, like, a few things left. Egg timers.
Yeah. {VOC laugh} Um, books.
Maybe next to the paper.
Uh -
Like right here?
Okay.
Think that's it with these. These are all sorta not really stocked very well but -
Yep.
Well, we could - .. Hm?
I wasn't even- We could take one thing off of each. {VOC laugh}
What are you gonna say?
Uh, let's see what else.
Assistant.. cooks.
Is -
I don't understand. Is that like, uh - .. teaching you to become an assistant cook?
Or -?
Anyway.. Should we, like - I guess go through each?
Okay so -
Math tutors sounds pretty essential.
Uh.
{VOC mouthnoise} Sex ed is - Is very important, I believe.
I think custodians are pretty essential- like actually keeping custodians around, feel like we should do.
That sounds important.
I gu- It's less important, but it's also good.
Also question mark. {VOC breath}
Poetry books? Yeah. Special ed teachers sounds really important.
Yeah.
Book keeping classes. I guess it's good if - for people who, like, run their own businesses.
I think we should keep them too.
Okay, so -
Assistant -
{VOC laugh} .. And assistant cooks.
And acting coaches.
Is it the one think you feel like -
Most strongly is -
Non-essential?
That's true. Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} This is true.
{VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Alright, you can take that one out.
Okay, public health and safety.
Reproductive education. How is that different from sex ed?
Oh, I see what you mean.
{VOC mouthnoise} Sure. Okay. Well -
Job training programs sounds important.
Chicken pox vaccinations sounds important.
Why not?
Also important.
Should also stay.
Yes.
Hm.
Question mark?
We already have invasive species removal.
Yeah.
Neighborhood watch support, sure.
Okay.
Recreation. 'Stray{PRN long /s/} cat spaying.
Could go.
(That's) true.
What are -? What are those?
{VOC laugh} {VOC breath} What are -? I don't really understand what community news ads are.
That sounds important.
Sounds nice to have.
Housing assistance? Yes. {VOC breath} Dog catcher? Sure..Boys basketball club.
Public access station? I don't know what that is.
Mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Oh.
Veterinary hospitals, that's important.
Football stadium upkeep.
Could.. be important.
So this is like a harder.. thing I guess.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
That's.. Yes.. {VOC laugh}
Alright.. That's good.
Yes..Speed limit signs? Yes.
{VOC laugh} Okay.
Sure.
Yes.
Hunting tags? Yes.. Towing services? I guess yes. {VOC breath} Massage certificates? Maybe not?
I see.
I see.
What are taxi stops?
Oh.
That's funny.
I don't know. Actually, I live in New York -
I've never heard of taxi stops. There's taxis everywhere. They just stop wherever they want to stop.{QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
Yeah..Yeah..Okay.
Fishing licenses - I mean I guess we're - if we're keeping hunting tags -
Public bus upkeep, sounds good. Drainage ditches also sounds good.
Maybe taxi stops?
Okay, so the things we're cutting 'are{PRN long} .. sugar free juice machines -
Okay, yes.
Yes, and -
Alright.
Yeah.
Um -
Sugar free juice machines, that seems, like, a little non-essential. Um -
I - I don't know.
But it seems like - .. Since it's -
It's li- It's - Either -
Teaching people - It's probably teaching people how to -
Be assistant cooks, or at least employing people.
So -
I don't know.{QUAL muttering}
Yeah we - I -It says we *must discuss each item and reach an agreement about whether - .. to cut it or to continue funding.
Yeah.
Assistant cooks, that one's questionable it sounds like. Um.. Sex ed -
Yeah, I think so too. Uh, custodians -
Yeah, yeah. Definitely.
Who else is gonna clean up? Cuz no one cleans up after themselves. {VOC breath} Um, speech therapy?
Yeah. Football equipment?
Yeah.
Question mark. Um, acting coaches?
Yeah, {VOC breath} unless, like, we're trying to preserve the arts. {VOC breath} Um -
Yeah. Cooking classes. {VOC breath} Uh, note takers, disability services, um -
I think that.. if - That should stay probably if - Especially if we're gonna keep the special ed.
Stuff, um - Sugar free juice machines, I still..  Uh, I question the essential.. ness of that one. Um -
Yeah.
Music teachers.
I think we should keep those.
Um. {VOC breath} So -
What were the things we had questions marks next to? Sugar free juice machines.
Uh -
Yeah.
Sh- I still feel like the sugar free juice machines is, like - Why not just put water fountains, you know?
And then we have zero calories instead of, you know, like some artificial juice.
Okay.. Um -
Maybe they're actually teaching you how -
Yeah. {VOC laugh}
Um -
'Yeah{PRN with /m/ at end} -
Yeah.
Invasive species removal.
Yeah, S_T_D_ education *needs to stay.
Uh, toxic waste disposal.
Mm-hm, hospital additions.
Um. {VOC breath} What's the budget for that anymore? Um -
Question mark, I think, even though it's probably important.. Uh, needle exchange.
I think that should stay, um -
Sex offender database.
Yeah, veteran's medical assistance.. I think so. Weed control?
Yeah.
Yeah, we can.. make that - Uh, weeds are invasi- invasive species. Let's consider it that. Prenatal check-ups. Yeah. Neighborhood watch -
It sounds like weed control is the one to go.
Okay.
Um -
Yeah, or else it's, uh - Or else like what i- {VOC breath} Then cats would be just, you know, reproducing everywhere, and you have a bunch of cats -
Uh, community news ads?
Who - Does that anymore? Like, don't people use twitter, or something (else)? {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
I don't know. Uh, the food bank needs - Yeah, junior soccer league -
Yeah, kitten and puppy adoption.
Yeah. I mean or else the - the pounds are gonna -
Get filled up. {VOC breath} Soup kitchens..yeah.
Dog catcher, yeah.
Yeah.. I think so.
Um -
I guess it's like -
Uh -
U_ dub broadcasts some lectures or something. Maybe it's like that.
Like it's -
Just a local.. cable thingy. {VOC laugh}
I don't know .. question{QUAL whispering} - question mark, like, on that one. Um -
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah, pest control.. Yeah.
I think it's because we don't really know what community news ads are, or the public access station -
Um.
I think that the community news ads would - are like -
Would become.. less essential.
Moving into the future, so let's cut that one.
Um -
Infrastructure and licensing. Teaching certificates.. needs to stay.
(1x) {NVC} Yeah, additional bus stops. Mm-hm.
Why do we need additional bus stops? Question mark. {VOC laugh}.. Tattoo artist licenses. Yeah.. Boating licenses.
Yeah.. Pothole maintenance.
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Subway system.
Yeah.
Hunting tags, yeah.
Mmhm.
Yeah. I - I don't know.
Um, is it like for -?
Like registered massage therapists.. Like wh- Like that work in chiropractor offices, and stuff?
Um, taxi stops.
Sounds kind of important.
Like, s- there are some places on the road that are.. designated taxi stops instead of parking spaces, like usually..  They're in front of like clubs or -and stuff like that, or at the airport.
So.. I guess that's.. kind of important.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess I've seen them, like -
I saw a few in Boston once, or like in Summerville, which is just outside Boston, but I guess its not really, like, *that essential. I'm sure that {VOC breath} the city will, you know, move on, like without the- the taxi stops cuz the p- the parking spaces that open up could generate more revenue.
So, (??) we can question mark on that one.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.. (but) -
So -
Yeah.
Yeah, weed control.
Commun- Community news ads.. and taxi stops.
We probably didn't cut that much out of the budget, but you know what? That's -That was the minimum that they were asking.
I think that's it.
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay.
'Cases of {PRN case uh} whiskey.
I think so, 'yep. {PRN yuh} {NVC}
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath}'With {PRN n} the food? Sure. Any particular place?

Half-inch tubing. I feel like that should all go in the same area.
I- {VOC breath} Yeah.. Somewhere in that first aisle.

Oh, I don't know. I was gonna say by the refrigerator magnet, and random -
I don't really know.
So far that 'doesn't {PRN dun} seem to match any -

Yeah, that's true.
Sure! It'll be our.. catchall.
I say that goes by refrigerator magnets, too. 'That's {PRN huts} the random stuff.

Socks are kinda random. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Put them by the pet food, we don't have anything down there.
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay.
'And {PRN n} shoelaces, too?
Kay.
Hm. {NVC} Sure.. The clothing and pet food section.
Sounds good.
Sure.
Yeah.. Somewhere over there. Sure.
Somewhere over in that first aisle, yeah.
Sure!
Maybe it's - maybe it's fishing books. Eh, just put it next to the books.
Close enough.
Pre-cut wood should also go over here.
'Light {PRN late} jackets, over here? {NVC}
Wetsuits.
Over here, too?
Or is that more over here?
Let's 'put it over {PRN pudover} here.
And the last one is hats. So, over here too.
Feel like our pet food's kinda -
Outta place, there.
Okay.
No.
I don't think we're very good at organizing stores based on {VOC breath} one item at a time, but.. 'that's {PRN ts} okay.
So, basically, these simulate aisles?
Okay, so I would.. I guess put it on the last row with food. {QUAL rising intonation}
Um.. hm! {VOC laugh}
{VOC breath} Uh, I don't know. {VOC breath}
'Up {PRN uh} to you!
I would say next to, yeah, the toilet paper. {VOC breath}
That looks good there, yeah.
Power c- cords?
Maybe next to boating supplies?
Probably nex- yeah, on the same.
Yep!
Should probably be saying these too. {QUAL laughing}
Electric - {QUAL laughing}
'Electric {PRN lectric} heaters.
Yep.
Oh yeah.
I think books can be next to -
The travel guides, or -
Yeah.
Food.
Toilet paper?
{VOC mouthnoise} {NVC} {NVC} Sticks of butter.
Packages of cookies.
{NVC} Mint toothpaste.
That.. makes sense. Bags of.. peat moss, which I still don't know what {QUAL laughing} is that. {VOC laugh}
Buckets. {QUAL long s}
Or, maybe -
Next to the mousetraps. Beets. {QUAL long s}
Yeah. {QUAL creaky}
Cans of peas
Bottles of juice. {QUAL long s}
Okay.
Dried figs.
Right here next to packages of cookies?
Alright.
Yep.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Alright.
Thanks. {NVC}
Empty plastic jugs. {QUAL long s}
Seems like a camping or outdoors thing. Next to -
This? Next to the bundles of sticks. {NVC} Large cups.
Yeah.
It seems like the empty plastic jugs could've been with large {QUAL laughing} cups, maybe. I don't know.
Hm. {VOC mouthnoise} Or maybe I'll just put it.. here, next to th-
Refrigerator {QUAL laughing} magnets.
Egg timers.
Yeah.
Loose-leaf paper.
How bout next to toys?
Box knives?
Next to backpacks, or - ?
Or n- siding, or -
Cushions for deck chairs.
Or - where is that again? {VOC breath}
{NVC} Oh.
Small saws.
Next to the box knives?
Mm-hm.
Uh-huh.
'That {PRN hat} makes sense.
Yep. {NVC} {VOC mouthnoise}
Yeah.
Yeah.
I guess - yeah, we can {VOC laugh} put (on). {QUAL laughing}
Yeah.
'Thanks. {PRN hankssss} So, I guess thick sweaters, in the clothing section.
Large vests. {QUAL long s}
Fleece-lined boots. {QUAL long s}
Maybe next to the 'shoe {PRN long sh} area. Heavy coats.
Next to.. this? {QUAL long s}
Fish hooks?
Fish h- next to the fishing net.
We can't do that, right?
{VOC mouthnoise} Alright.
Okay.
Okay.
Cuz there's no room, here, so -
Yeah. {VOC breath}
It wouldn't be good to put it with the human food, right? {QUAL laughing} No. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} {VOC laugh}
{VOC start} Well, should we start with education programs?
Alright.
Math tutors.
I do too.
Assistant cooks.
They're all gonna s- be important.
Yeah.
Okay, so assistant 'cooks is {PRN cooks} a possibility to cut, right?
Sex ed.. Seems pretty important to me.. Custodians are pretty important.
Speech therapy, I'm biased, I think it's really important. {VOC laugh}
Football equipment. {VOC breath}
Yeah. That's something that -
{VOC start} Could be fundraised for.
Okay, so potentially two.
Acting coaches.
*I would kinda cut it, but -
Okay.
Poetry books.
It is for sure.. Let's see.
Yep.
Yeah.
Cooking classes could be cut.
Can learn how to do that at home.
Sugar-free juice machines.
That could be cut, too, theoretically, if -
Do you think it's important?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
I agree.
I agree. {VOC breath}
I think {QUAL very quiet} music is important, for sure.
So, which ones (do you) wanna cut for sure?
I think.. we're.. really in agreement about football equipment.
Acting coaches?
Agree.
Yeah, assistant cooks.
Cooking classes?
Do you agree?
Do those seem -
It's four.
Should we?
Five.
Think we're -
Yes, we are. Alright! Five. Public health and safety.
Reproductive education.
I think so.
Maybe it's -
I don't know.
'Well {PRN ll} I guess theoretically if we already have it, we could cut it, right?
I don't know.
Mm-hm.
I - well, *I didn't get a chicken pox vaccination. I think a lot of kids just naturally get chicken pox and then they're fine.
Don- isn- don't they?
I think! I mean - mm-hm.
Oh really? Did you have the vaccination?
Really? {QUAL falling intonation}
Yeah, I think that's really (1x). Mm-hm. That's what I've heard.
'Yeah. {PRN yeh}
I th- I don't think so, I - I think you -
M- most people just get it when they're a kid, and then -
I could be wrong, 'though. {PRN oh}
So.. potentially we could cut that one. Let's keep going, but -
Invasive species removal.
I don't know.
It's important, but I'm not sure if it's on the *top of the list.
Potentially. Kay. 'S_T_D_ {PRN S_T_} education. Pretty important.
That's true.
And reproductive education.
Well, we could theoretically cut one or the other of those and makes.. the other one take over.
Kay, toxic waste disposal, that's really important.
Do you wanna read them? Just for -
Important, I think.
I don't know what that means.
Do you?
Okay.
'Well {PRN ll} let's keep it for now, in case it's important.
Sex offender database.
I do too.
Veterans -
I do too.
I think so. Yeah, I think that's less important. I -
'Pre-natal {PRN prenail} checkups, very important. Neighborhood watch support, that's -
'That's {PRN s} pretty important. So if we were to get rid of four -
I think chicken pox.
Invasive species?
One of the educations. Either reproductive or S_T_D_, do you agree?
Okay.
Oh really?
Ok. Well, I wonder if reproductive has to do with -
Like, even -
Childbirth, and -
Caring for children.{SIL}
Like, {VOC start} you know -
Pre-natal care.
Well, weed control f- we can take out.
So - {QUAL lengthened}
{VOC mouthnoise} 'That's {PRN ats} three. We need one more.
Sure, since we don't know what it is. {VOC laugh}
Okay, recreation and public services. Go ahead, you can read them.
That's a good thing. 'I don't know. {PRN n no no}
'Okay. {PRN nkay}
'That's {PRN ts} pretty important.
Yeah.
Yeah that.. 'is true. {PRN n strue}
I know a lot of churches run food banks, too.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Oh, I like the idea, but that *is something that could be cut.
I don't know.
As far as the level importance, it seems *less important than soup kitchens to me.
Stays? Yeah. Housing assistance, think stays.
Dog catcher -
I don't know.
I think that's th-
They take.. pets to the pound.
If they're out running around.
I don't.. know if that's important or not. I've never really been {VOC mouthnoise} 'exposed {PRN sposed} that much that.
So.
Potentially we could ki- cut it.
Boy's basketball club
I'd rather keep the soccer league, cuz it sounds like it's for everyone.
Than the basketball club. {VOC breath}
Public access station?
What does that mean?
{VOC mouthnoise} Kay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, I have.
'Veterinary {PRN vetrinary}
That's important, but it also 'doesn't {PRN dun} seem like it'd be fun- funded by the community.
'By {PRN ai} the county, rather.
Football stadium upkeep and pest control.. Okay.
'So if {PRN sf} we're to cut four -
'We {PRN h} kinda said -
Kitten and puppy adoption.
Right?
Dog catcher.
Do we agree?
Um -
Boy's basketball club.
'And - {PRN eeyend}
Sure. We'll - we'll 'let {PRN lets} a private one take over.
Okay. {VOC breath}
Go for it.
I agree.
I agree.
That's helpful.
Yeah, that's true.
Mm-hm.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
{VOC start} I don't know 'if - {PRN f}
I don't know much about that.
Um - but it's not very important to me, personally, so -
Maybe.
So, 'potent- {PRN attent} potentially t- additional bus stops and tattoo artist licenses.
I agree.
Yeah. I think {QUAL breathy} that's pretty important.
I think that's important to be funding.
I would also say that's important for control.
People don't.. hunt too much.
{VOC mouthnoise} Sure.
'I would say {PRN who would see} also not as important.
I don't know. {NVC}
Yeah.
'I don't know. {PRN I no no} Let's cut that one.
{VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Let's keep it. (2x) keep the last 'three. {PRN rolled r}
K- so -
The ones 'we we're {PRN we're} were additional bus stops, tattoo artist licenses -
Towing services, m- s- massage certificates, and taxi stops, so we can keep one of those. Which one do we wanna keep?
{VOC start} 'Should {PRN chould} we keep that one? {VOC mouthnoise}
{VOC start} Sounds good.
{VOC breath} {VOC breath} Alright.
Alright.
Think that's important.
{VOC mouthnoise} I don't know. Doesn't.. s- {QUAL long s} {NVC} {VOC breath} This is for funding, right?
Alright.
Mm-hm.
{VOC laugh} Yeah. {QUAL laughing}
Um, {QUAL lengthened} not really.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
I think that's -
Educational, (??) -
Yeah.
Special ed teacher, seems important.
Along with the notetakers. {QUAL long s}
Yeah.
Yeah. {VOC breath} Hm.
That seems controversial, I feel like they'd want that.
But -
I don't know. Ch- sugar-free juice machines doesn't seem as important as.. {QUAL long s} the other things.
Yeah, bookkeeping classes seems -
Helpful.
Music teachers -
Alright.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
And assistant cooks?
Mm-hm.. Yeah.
How many is that?
What 'abou- {PRN aboa-} were we gonna get rid of the juice machines, or - ?
Alright. Wow, we're very.. fiscally conservative. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
Well job training programs is pretty crucial, so -
And so is - (??) chicken pox vaccinations, right? {NVC} {VOC breath} And I should probably stop, um, mumbling! {VOC laugh} I'll speak louder.
What do you think?
Have you ever had it? Or - I've never had it.. I probably -
No. {NVC}
Yeah, so for my case, I'd probably - {VOC laugh} {VOC breath }Isn't it more serious as an adult, if - ?
But.. {VOC mouthnoise} I guess it's not really -
Important, then?
Alright.
Yeah.
Sounds like the other thing. Like sex ed and reproductive -
Education. Why is it {VOC laugh} all in.. different categories?
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Hospital additions.
Alright. Needle exchange.
'I'm {PRN um, lengthened} not sure, {VOC mouthnoise} but I *should know because I work in healthcare.. I'm sure it's something about syringes.
Hm.
But I'm not quite sure, so - {VOC laugh}
*I - think that's important.
Veterans medical assist- I think that's important.
And weed control is - not marijuana, but -
Just, like, gardening and stuff, right? {QUAL laughing on right}
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think S_T_D_ - w- is more important to stress -
Than reproductive.. education, {QUAL whispering} right?
Right.
Alright.
And how many is that?
Needle exchange, maybe?
Okay. {QUAL laughing}
Stray cat spaying
Yeah.
Community news ads.
That's good for business {QUAL long s} and stuff I guess.
Food bank
Yeah.
But food bank seems like something that {VOC start} people donate.
Not necessarily fund.. (1x), so -
Yeah.
'It's {PRN ts} kind of a non-profit.. thing. I don't know.
Don't really know how that's funded n- necessarily.
So -
Junior soccer league.
Yeah.
Kitten and puppy adoption.
Would you fund that, or - ?
Eh, no. {VOC laugh}
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
I think soup kitchens -
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
What is that?
{VOC start} Isn't that, like, animal control?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
Right.
'Yeah. {PRN nyeah}
I don't know.
Oh! Oh, like a - the T_V_ station for -
Public- for local -
Shows and stuff.
You've never seen public access channel? Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
The boy's basketball club?
The vet hospital?
Okay.
Yeah.
{VOC moutnoise} Okay, infrastructure and licensing. Teaching certificates, seems important. Speed limit signs are very important, I guess. Additional bus stops.
I mean, for which city is this for? For Seattle, there's a lot of - {VOC breath}
Transit in this area, so -
I would -
{VOC breath} For Seattle, I wouldn't fund more for that.
Um -
So I would get rid of that.
Tattoo artist licenses?
I didn't - {VOC start} hm -
Kno-
Yeah.
So we could cut that?
Yeah, boating licenses seems more important than a *tattoo artist.. license, (1x).
Pothole 'maintenance. {PRN mainance} Cuz Seattle has.. {VOC mouthnoise} lot's of potholes, I guess. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} {NVC} {VOC breath}In fact, they're not s- okay, I'm not gonna be political, but yeah. {VOC breath} Subway system. {VOC breath}
Uh-huh.
Hunting tags.
Yeah.. Towing services. {VOC mouthnoise}
Um -
Not really that important, I guess.. {NVC} Mm - 'massage {PRN massodge} certificates.
Mm.
Taxi stops.
Mm -
Alright. Fishing licenses.
Alright!
Oh! We were gonna get rid of towing services?
'Yeah, {PRN long i} I gue- uh, do-
I guess so.
Alright.
That's okay. {VOC breath}
Here, just put it on the table.
There we go, keys off the floor. {VOC mouthnoise} Okay. Um, I have tweezers, {VOC breath} *light jackets, {VOC breath} and you have egg timers.
Alright. {VOC breath}
Siding. {QUAL loud whisper}
Food, (yeah), which is good.
Kay.
This gets more into that kind of, um -
Stuff.
Um -
Toi- tweezers, maybe with toilet paper?
As a, um, personal hygiene item.
That's what I thought. Ma- magnets, yeah.
Alright, then we have jackets. Do we have *any.. clothing items up here at all?
Well, what we could do then is maybe make this (room)?
Kay.
'That's {PRN ats} right, we get three at a time.
Ah, here.
Hats.. Hats and light jackets should definitely go 'together. {PRN tojether}
Well, knowing what might be in there -
See, th- this large swath?
I think if we end up with all the hats and sweaters and -
Yeah, that would all be over here.
Mm-hm.
Which 'would {PRN /ə/} be with the shoes.
Cuz we have axes, matches -
Um, for *this arrangement we have.. identified no area for clothing.
Th- well, this is foods of all kinds, so far. Except for pet food.
Yeah this -
Could be. And this could all be, um - this is m-
I don't know. It seems like this area is open and we could put clothing in there. But -
Wetsuits? {VOC breath}
Kay.
Yeah, there's a whole 'bunch of - {PRN buncha}
Hats and jackets should go with clothing of whatever -
Cuz we're - 'remember {PRN member} we also have shoes -
And, um -
'See, {PRN /s/} I don't know. When I think about a *store, I don't think about going to -
Different areas. I think about -
Ab- one of these *big stores -
All the *clothing is in one area.
So I wouldn't separate jackets out into boating supplies, cuz it would be w-
But this isn't.
Right, but they're - oh, okay.
I - that's not how I would -
Design a store, though.
Mm-hm.
Well, these are the utilities.
I think so. But I wouldn't {VOC hesitation} mix up -
Well, I just think they need to -
There just needs to be an *area that can be dedicated to clothing, wherever we decide.
You know what I mean? Cuz if - if you just walk down, you looked at toys, ran into clothes, pet food, or whether you do -
'That'd {PRN very reduced} be fine.
Sure.
Alright.
Plastic jugs. Tow ropes.
Small axes. This all seems like this.
Sure.
F- I think all those go - doesn't matter.
I don't think it matters where those go.
Sure.
This could be with mousetraps, or -
'Just {PRN /ʒs/} kinda - okay, now we have shoelaces.
Bagels, and chocolate bars. So these have to go over here somewhere, and shoelaces goes with.. shoes, if we ever get any.
Can't move them. Yep.
Well, no, they *have to be with our f-
Clothing.
Which could be on this side, too, 'remember? {PRN member}
We don't - we don't have any shoes yet, but wherever shoes are is where shoelaces would be.
'Exactly. {PRN izzakly} So what do you think 'with these? {PRN withese}
Chocolate bars -
Think this is good. And bagels would be -
Really, it's own.. thing, yeah.. There you go, I like the sound of that.
Alright.
*I think so.
*Box knives.
Okay. And this was *definitely something around here, right?
Face cream, toilet paper, tweezers.. Right here, right here.
Apparently we've been to, uh -
Large stores together before.
'There {PRN r} we go. Soap - ooh, cookies. Packages of them.
Right there, maybe?
Sure! {QUAL lengthened}
Canned - maybe here?
Alright {VOC mouthnoise} here's three more.
Ooh, butter.
'That'd {PRN /æd/} be next to eggs.
Yep.
{NVC} Oh, very good. Small axes. Okay.
*Cushions for *deck chairs.. No.
These are all gonna be -
Okay.
Yeah! I think so.
And those are -
Gonna go on that side, too.
Very good.
Sure!
I th- I think anybody who's looking for that s- is gonna go through that whole aisle.
Kay. Now we have some boots -
Some books, and some backpacks.
Mm-hm. That'd be good.
{VOC start} Backpacks and books. Maybe by toys or by travel guides.
Well, this could be here.
Yeah, I agree. {VOC breath}
And -
See, that's the problem with having it here and not in a larger area.
So if we're doing this, I think we should -
That's true.
Yeah. Then this could be boots and this is clothing.
An-
(1x), {QUAL assenting} works for me.
'What about {PRN /həɾəbaʊ/} beets? {VOC breath} Maybe here?
No, this is veggies.
Well this doesn't say canned. {VOC breath} {NVC}
I think don- doughnuts will be -
'Um - {PRN uhuhummm}
Next to sugar?
{VOC laugh} That's funny. {QUAL laughing}
Yeah! I like where you stuck it.
Well, the - on the other side. The little kiddies won't know. And {VOC hesitation} the parents could pick it up while their kids are shopping!
Alright.
I could actually -
(Well), that's true.
Alright, pouches of oatmeal.
I think it's fine there.
We don't want it next to.. all the -
We don't want it next to here, cuz we don't want people doing a whole buncha - yeah.
Whole buncha drinking while you - {VOC laugh}
Alright, mint toothpaste.
That's okay.
Sounds good.
Doesn't matter.
What do you think about heavy coats here?
Now we got some dried figs.
In here?
Alright, we're getting close! We're getting close.
(Uh, I) don't know if we're gonna make it. {VOC breath} Ooh! Here's the water -
For the {VOC start} empty buckets we don't have.
Mm, or we could have it - {VOC start}
Actually, water a lot of times is where the - {VOC breath}
Isn't it?
How bout that?
'Ooh. {PRN /ou/} Wha- we have this too, though.
Mm.
Alright.
There it is.
'Okay. {PRN yokay}
Okay, we got.. duct tape.. electric heaters, and bags of peat moss.
I think mousetraps.
With this one or with your two?
Okay.
'You know, {PRN y'know} we also have *this area. Which maybe could correspond to -
Yeah, maybe.
Um.
I don't think we *have anything else pet-related.
Y- I think we could totally do that.
Okay.
And duct tape could be -
Oh, that could go by box knives, though!
Yeah!
Alright.. now, here's.. random.
Five-pound weights.
Small saws.
So maybe that's here? Yeah.
And then *matches.
Maybe here?
I'm just trying to think of -
Oh.
Oh, you're right. That does make sense right there. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} I think so.
Either way.
Alright, here's a nother good one.
For maybe -
This area.
Hm.
That's where we'd stick that. Th-
Kay. {VOC breath}
Large cups.
Yeah, sure.
Maybe there?
Well, it looks like we're - {VOC breath}
Oh, tha- t- ts- true.
Hm.
How bout here, though? Cuz then we have all these other kinda kitchen-y items.. Like, what you'd turn around (and see now).
'That's {PRN hats} true.
I always end up in that weird, like - {VOC mouthnoise}
Foil.. aisle.
I think it would be -
Well, not - {VOC hesitation} 'it's {PRN ts} hard to - hard to say.
Yeah, that's true. For all this stuff, too.
Bottles of juice and loose-leaf paper.
'Be {PRN mmbe} like, right here, right? Or -
I'll just stick that right there. Yep!.
That leaves us with *this one.
Trying to see - maybe travel guides? So maybe here?
That was it. Yeah.
Wherever.
Yeah!
It could go next to the bottles of juice. That's not a bad idea.
Yep.
And we're done, we think.
Wonder where it came from.
(1x) interesting.
Well, first of all let's look at what's - what we gotta work wi-
So the food seems to be over there.
Pet food and toys are opposite.
'Yeah. {PRN hyeah}
'Yeah. {PRN hyeah}
'Yeah. {PRN hyeah}
'Alright. {PRN hright}
And these guys go up with.. egg timer?
Alright. {QUAL creaky}
No.
Let's hold off.
Let's grab another one.
Well, okay, got power cords over here.
And your mousetraps.
So, like, this makes sense.
Well, no, think about what else was on the list. You had whiskey, cake, beets, sugar, butter.
And then you had your, um, shoelaces -
(But) we - (1x) know that we can't use that same logic, cuz we're gonna - we got different placements up here. So what makes sense for this arrangement?
So, dry foods -
And what's going to go in the middle here?
Your toothpaste, your water.. b- jugs. Water jugs up here by boating?
Well, how bout your clothing over here?
Well, cuz it all, uh - wetsuits by boating supplies.
Or fishing. And then we still have our fishing stuff.
Travel guides? Mousetraps?
{VOC breath} Yeah. {QUAL breathy}
Yeah, I agree.
Oh, it's a wetsuit, though.
And these are jackets and hats. These are outdoor things.
I was outdoor activities area.
And this is *interior.
And this is the kitchen.
And this is, uh.. supplies. Like, utility.
Oh, (and it's) a -
So, it's a general store, I thought, we were shaping.
Mm-kay.
So where do you think hats, then?
Let's just call it - what, uh - where do you want it, here?
How bout this?
Dog walkers? Supplies.
'Alright. {PRN /araiʔ/}
We gonna put *all of them up there.
Power cords or siding.
Water (1) - away from the power cords. Tow rope.. tow rope.
Sorry, I had to sneeze. That was a strange sound. Tow ropes up by the boats, right?
And empty plastic jugs. This is one I -
Okay.
How bout - oh, we can't move them once we put them on there.
Um, shoes.. could go by the pet food?
Or -
Okay.
We'll put the shoes down there.
Cake and chocolate bars go together, but th- like, s'mores, people looking for s'mores, yep. And bagels -
Yeah, by the eggs. Breakfast.
Water -
Jugs?
Uh.. (it's) fishing, cleaning the fish.
Y- {QUAL lengthened} Where are the tweezers? Uh -
Yeah, yeah.
I don't know! This reminds me of the Port Gamble -
General Store. Oh, this goes with bars of soap.
Yeah, sure. {VOC mouthnoise}
Whiskey, cookies, cake.
Yeah! That makes sense. Lunch m- lunch.
I'm surprised there's not tunafish on the list. Sticks of butter.
Eggs? Or -
Yeah.
Pre-cut wood and heavy cable.
Cushions for for deck ch- that wasn't on our list!
Oh.. That goes by boating supplies.
What do you think, here?
Half-inch tubing and gas.. cookstoves.
We (gotta) cook the - {NVC}
I think next to the wood.
Well -
Or here, next t- {VOC mouthnoise}
Half-inch tubing.
You wanted the shoes (in) the -
So, the -
Books.
Yeah, that sounds fine. How bout the.. books - travel guides and books are the same thing.
You sit and 'read them, {PRN reem} 'you gotta {PRN y'otta} put it in the backpack.
Oh.
That would go here maybe? Well -
We could do this. And put them on the other side.
Will that work?
Okay.
You think they're canned or fresh?
But the eggs, you assume, is fresh. Sticks of butter you assume is fresh. You need a refrigerator.
Socks. Well, we know where that g- that goes with shoelaces. {NVC}
Oh. Where do the - where should that go?
Seriously?
No.
No, no, if you put it by the ice cream and the sugar, it makes it easier.
For the parents to shop.
Well, d- what do you think? Seriously?
{VOC mouthnoise} It's still sort of food item, (on the other one). Oh, oh, yeah, pouches of 'oatmeal. {PRN outmeal}
How bout here?
Well, you know, you *do have in the the far righthand corner, that *is a problem.. for the register.
You'd have to have a camera on that. That wasn't a good idea.
'Alright, {PRN aight} um, toothpaste?
Uh, next to the toilet paper? Or the bar of soap?
{VOC breath} Yeah. {NVC}
Mm.
Yeah.
I don't know!
There could be.. a xylophone in here.
Next to the mousetraps?
Yep.
Yep, fish hooks.
Over here.
Should be up here.
Oh.
Here.
Yeah, there's a fishing section then w- *then you get the power cords
Mm-hm.
Okay.
That makes sense to me.
An electric heater. Would that go -
Here?
Or - this sh-
What else would be pet-related?
We can only look at three, though.
Toilet paper.
I think maybe - {VOC mouthoise}
Well this is near the power cord, though.
{NVC} And you need the tubing to cover the.. electrical. And the duct tape's just practical.
Right here?
Right. {NVC} That makes more sense.
Yeah, these were the ones we're (walking) for.
Okay.
How bout here? Yeah. Small saws near the -
Away from the toy section.
Kitchen. It's a kitchen item, too. How bout here? Those are all practical.
How bout these guys?
That's a little unkind. Visually.
Oh.
Bundles of sticks. {QUAL whispering}
Bundles o- yeah. I think maybe bundles of sticks here.
Well, no, plastic jugs.
I think maybe -
Here.
Well, wouldn't you wanna put them near - {VOC start} the beverages?
Well, m-
Well, that's all food, though.
When you're in a hurry for something -
You go look where, for cups?
Yeah.
{NVC} Um, the foil aisle. Where would the foil aisle be in this?
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, I.. agree.
How bout -
Something across the way would be logical?
Empty plastic jugs.
Well, once we place it. So what else we got?
Bottles of juice would be -
Yeah.
Don't you think?
Near, uh - well, {VOC breath} wait - m- {VOC hesitation} yeah.
These guys should go together. Yeah, that would be good.
Yeah.
So what else - are we done?
So, large cups could go -
Wherever we want them.
It's th- it's the outlier, though
Alright, so let's look at the first one and see if there's *anything that we can agree on, first column -
Of *one thing -
That needs to be -
That *can be cut, I should say.
So, looking through that list, math tutors, assistant cooks, sex ed, custodians, speech therapy, football equipment, acting coaches, poetry books -
Special ed teachers, cooking classes, notetakers, disability services -
Sugar-free juice machines -
Bookkeeping classes and music teachers.
I think, for me it's very easily to say the sugar-free juice machines.
Because.. I don't really th- see a need to have *any type of -
Juice machine in any school anywhere.. They can drink water.
Okay, so there's our one thing.. Right?
Alright, you wanna read that list for us?
Okay.
Do any of these jump out as - {VOC breath}
Easiest to cut?
Yeah, nei- me neither.
Where did you see hospital additions?
Oh, yeah, there it is right there.
Yep.
Um, let's see -
Well, maybe it should be w-
Well maybe we should say weed control.
Could be the first to go.
I don't understand why you need a neighborhood watch support.
I mean, neighborhoods can *have neighborhood watches.
Why do you need a separate area to support?
Yeah.
If there's a neighborhood watch and something happens, they just call the police.
I don't understand why you need a separate -
Yeah, I agree.
So then, th-
There's a question of reproductive education, S_T_D_ education -
Those kinda seem like you could.. hit -
Two birds with one s-
'tone. {PRN finishing 'stone'}
Yeah, but we already have sex ed -
Here, so the teenagers are already getting reproductive and S_T_D_ education.
So if we're talking about adults, what are we trying to teach them?
Would be more important than -
Well, {VOC hesitation} so in *that case, I think -
Neighborhood watch support could go. Pre-natal checkups *can't go.
Well, they *could. A- we could still just pick one.
Which one of those two? Or maybe find a third one easier.
Alright. So, number thr- uh, column three, recreation and public services.
Stray cat spaying, community news ads, food bank -
Junior soccer league
Kitten and puppy adoption, {VOC mouthnoise} soup kitchens, housing assistance, dog catcher, boys basketball club, public access station -
Veterinary hospital, football stadium upkeep, and pest control.
Now why is a veterinary hospital.. a public service?
Well -
Why do those need to be - but why do those need to be a public service? We have private - {VOC start}
But we have private -
{VOC start} Yeah, {VOC hesitation} don't we have - I mean, dog catcher typically has been a public -
Publicly funded, but -
Kitten and puppy adoption is handled voluntarily by, like, PAWS and -
Humane Society and stuff, so I'm just unclear -
Right, but why couldn't the dog.. catcher take them to the Humane Society?
But they could. And then -
No, I don't think it is, because we *have veterinary hospitals that are.. private.
Th- people who have pets {VOC start} pay - like, when I - {VOC hesitation} I - when my dog needs help, I have to ta- I ha- take him to a hospital, but it's not a -
Publicly funded hospital.
Is it?
{VOC breath} Well, I don't know - no, I was just curious why -
{VOC  mouthnoise} I don't know. {QUAL whispering} Football stadium - football stadium can take care of (2x).
I think we should s- {VOC hesitation}
I think {NVC} the public could definitely handle stray cat spraying - spaying -
Because I think *that -
{VOC start} {VOC hesitation} Does good, {VOC hesitation} like, a  lon-
A long way.
I'm just not sure why -
See, like, soup kitchens I think are great, but -
Those are also -
Private. I'm - I'm just - the l- the list is bizarre!
Oh, they *are, but they're not usually -
They're not usually -
Like, the food banks where I grew up -
They weren't - the city didn't provide them with anything. The food banks were run voluntarily by -
Bazillions of little churches that got together.
So I - {VOC hesitation} this is just an odd list to me.
Cuz it's, like, a combination of.. weird things.
That {VOC hesitation} I wouldn't even think would be on the list.. Why is a boys basketball clu- oh, see, but that could be parks and rec.
Right.
The what what?
Yeah.
Well, what do you think?
Well I think maybe kitty - kitten and puppy adoption.
It's, like, if you have a community newsletter.
Right?
{VOC mouthnoise} It'd still have to be handled, though.
Whether it's online or paper, it would still be -
Some department somewhere.. responsible for it.
I th- said I thought kitten and puppy adoption -
Could be handled.
Not through the city.
Alright, then we got infrastructure and licensing.
Teaching certificates, speed limit signs, additional bus stops, tattoo artist licenses -
Boating licenses, pothole maintenance, subway system -
Hunting tags, towing services, massage certificates, taxi stops -
And (our) - {VOC mouthnoise} there we go. Taxi stops, fishing licenses -
Public bus upkeep and drainage ditches.
Alright, so looking at this list -
Why is towing services on here?
No, but this is - we're pretending that this is a *city or something, right?
Right, so a city doesn't *provide a towing service.
No. They - what they do is they call -
There's a list of - I know, because I know how they handle this, but there's a list of, like, all the local towing -
Companies -
And they have to cycle through them one after another.
So here's Triple A_ se- towing, they call them up
Yeah.. That's not part of -
Any government service.
Well, what do they mea- what do you think, if they mean towing services, like, for towing their *own -
Vehicles.
Do you know what I mean? Like -
Yeah, what is taxi stops?
Mm-hm.
Well, I- {VOC start}
R- yeah.. I just didn't know why towing services was on the list.
Huh, that would make sense, wouldn't it?
We just need to drop one.. Yeah.
What what?
Well, that's what - it depends on the definition of towing services. If the definition of towing services is, let's say there's a car accident and someone needs to tow the car out of the road -
A private towing service -
Is called.
Right, it's a contracted thing. So that's *not part of any public service.
If it's - means -
The s- city's bus -
Broke down -
And they had to specially tow the city bus to the city parking garage so that -
The city bus could -
Yeah.
W- *that you would have to keep, because you can't not -
Tow your own -
Yeah, right.
Yes. Let's call that public bus upkeep, and we can drop towing services.
'Exactly. {PRN gzakly}
Yeah, it's a big job. You can't just call -
Yeah.
Alright, well, I think we're done then.
Unless there was anything else.
It does.
{NVC} Yeah.
Well that's why I think we left -
This one here.
And took that one out.. Because by the time you're an adult - {NVC} {QUAL other speaker coughing}
I th- {VOC start} you have pre-natal checkups, but the time you're an adult.. you don't really need to know -
A woman ovulates every twenty eight days, and then -
No, I think -
Absolutely.
And I think if any of the teachers have to go, unfortunately for me, personally, it would be the acting coach -
But not poetry and not.. um -
Music.
Or, like, art
{VOC mouthnoise} I- and I know that.. acting is one of those arts, but I -
Somehow think that's a smaller niche than -
That's true.
Well, luckily we didn't have to take it out, so, we're good!
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so.
Let's see, we, uh - let's see -
Yeah. So, {VOC start} our task was to simply decide, which we have done. And they get to -
Bitch and moan, and that's too bad for them, but -
We decided.
No, 'that's {PRN ats} not what it says.
Your task is to decide.
And we appeared fair by.. cutting equally.
This is hard.
Yeah.
Well -
So they want us to say the words probably, so m- I'll read it. Um -
Education programs. So we're starting with education first.
Huh.
{VOC start} Alright, let's go for it. I - I agree with that.
{VOC breath} 'Yep. {PRN hyep}
Yeah. {PRN hyuh} So we gotta get (1x) rid of one on the other side.
Sure. Public health and safety. Reproductive education, job training programs, chicken pox vaccinations -
Invasive species removal, S_T_D_ education, toxic waste disposal -
Hospital *additions, needle exchange, sex offender database -
Veterans medical assistance.. weed control, pre-natal checkups, and neighborhood watch support.
No.
Maybe hospital additions?
Under toxic waste disposal.
Now, some would say invasive species removal, but that's really important for Seattle.
And weed control is not the same thing.
But they're *of the same nature.
Mm, a separate office, you mean?
To -
Yeah. Sorry, I had to sneeze, Heather. Um, neighborhood watch support, you think then.. might - it's definitely we have to keep pre-natal checkups.
And the V_A_. {NVC}
It's {PRN 'eights'} pretty different populations, actually. Teenagers and adults.
Um, you could combine the two.
Oh.
Well, I think maybe S_T_D_ education.
Oh, this is really hard.
Well, neighbors could be helping in a time of budget, so yeah, let's get rid of neighborhood watch support.
Hm.
Because it handles the d- animals.
Public health.
Look, you got stray cat spraying, and baby and kitten 'puppy {PRN pupping} adoption *and the veterinary hospital.
It's a public service.
Uh, to keep, uh, vermin down.
Disease control.
You also have dog catcher on there.
Well, the dog catcher picks up the puppies and the kittens. And then they adopt them out.
The dog catcher doesn't do that.
It would be a more humane world if they did, yes.
Right, so in a hypothetical world.. {VOC start} veterinary hospital *would be essential.
Alright.
So, get rid of the veterinary hospital?
Is {PRN ih} that more important than football stadium upkeep?
Couldn't the football stadium people take care of their own upkeep?
(??) conference rooms, you gotta lead a f- leave a conference room clean. You ha- you leave a stadium clean?
No, those are essential for homeless.
There aren't enough of them.
Yeah.
You'll have to keep the junior soccer league.
The junior soccer league.
Well, hm-
{VOC mouthnoise} There has to be one thing to go.
What are the community news ads? That's important.
Some would say that could go online.
Well -
What do you s- what do you suggest?
'Go {PRN ho} for it.
Uh-huh.
That's how you make your {NVC} money.
Yeah.
But they have to tow the cars they're -
Towing away to the.. tow yard for the parking tickets.
Mm-hm?
So that's an easy one. You say towing system - services?
So the- mm -
Well, then taxi stops?
Those are signs.
A signing service. Speed limit signs -
Additional bus stops.
Pothole maintenance *has to stay.
The subway system *has to stay. {NVC}
So, you say -
Towing services.. but the public bus upkeep is important.
And the drainage ditches are essential.
But those drainage ditches could be maintained by -
{VOC mouthnoise} Invasive species removal.. department.
But we're down to {QUAL lengthened} just w- one item.
So what would you propose if the towing service people said -
Where would the towing services be absorbed into?
Right.
The dispatcher.. (1x) contracted. Yeah.
Yeah, y- um, I think I understand, yeah.
But wouldn't that be a part of the budget for public bus upkeep already?
The towing services would be in that.
Because if the public bus is stuck -
Or the public transportation pool is stuck, they would *have to have something *big enough as a bus.
That's the worst case scenario.
So it looks like we identified at least two things.
Now, I'm - I'm glad that you.. and I agreed on that s- S_T_D_ education and.. reproductive education. The way those are worded, it makes it harder to make the choice.
And sex ed is *kinda the same thing, but -
I wonder if there's a way to involve all of them.
You very thoughtful person.
It's really nice that you took that - now, and we left the math tutors and the acting coaches. Some would say the acting coaches need to go. Some would say -
The music teachers need to go.
But I think the m-
Music teachers are more essential than the sugar-free juice machines.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It *does help with social behavior.
Well, we didn't have to take it off.
But I can see where there's (a little) wiggle room.
You're very thoughtful person.
So do you think we - we could.. present to a committee and.. would seem -
I - I think we've done -
Done well.
Or we (are) trying to move others to help.
Yeah.
We did.
{VOC mouthnoise} I like that method, actually.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} So now we kinda know the categories. Should we take these outta the box first and organize them into categories? {VOC breath}
(1x) Well - Okay. Let's just kinda - {VOC breath} Cuz we know there's food, we know there's sort of outdoor equipment. {VOC breath}
I don't mind. Just - .. {VOC start} K- I thought - How bout if we put em over here? And kinda - {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} Clo- Oh new column.
Yeah, this might help us.
Outdoor stuff. Gadgets? Like scissors?
I dunno what flags are. {VOC laugh}
Yeah.
{VOC breath} Here. Right here.
Clothing.
Tweezers is gonna go - Oh - Okay.
Electric s- Electric heaters. Household items, maybe, huh?
Oh, or here. .. With - Okay.
Uh, liters of water. Mm-kay. {VOC start}
Mm-hm.
{VOC breath} {VOC start} Or .. could it be with the camping stuff, maybe, for the duct tape? {VOC breath}
Yeah.
Camping -
Mm-hm.
Empty plastic jugs. {QUAL whispering}
{VOC breath} Empty plastic jugs. That might be the camping stuff, huh?
Toothpaste and soap together? {VOC breath}
Five-pound weights? What are those for?
Oh. {VOC laugh}
Yeah.
Now large cups, is that for the camping stuff? Or maybe with paper bags?
Camping - Wanna give me half of those? Yeah, thanks.
Yeah. Loose leaf paper.
Peat moss. {QUAL whispering} {VOC breath}
And loose leaf paper?
With large cups and paper bags, maybe? {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath}
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah, that's a good plan. And um -
{VOC mouthnoise} Mm-kay.
So, here we got the cooking supplies for food. And here we've got the edible stuff. So maybe {QUAL lengthened} .. liters of water -
Yeah. That's right. Which would go like here? M- Oh, cake mix. That's there.
Dairy. Right down -
But what about eggs and dairy? Yeah.
Maybe that's camping. No? {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
Dried figs. {QUAL muttering}
Sweets maybe? .. On this side?
Okay, that's fresh food, down here.
Canned foods. Um, I'll put that -
That's frozen food. Um. That'll be here, maybe with packages of cookies?
Okay. {VOC breath} I'm not sure where the can of peas is gonna go yet.
Yeah.
Maybe -
here. I'm not sure.
Bottles of juice? Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.
And the soy beans - {QUAL lengthened} It doesn't say dry. Well let's just stick em there. Yeah. We're good enough.
Should we - ? {VOC start} {VOC breath} Well -
Yeah.
Okay. .. Yeah.
Well let's see, because we - We only had - See, we've got -
You had one row of all food, and this is one row of all food. So maybe we've got - {VOC breath} One, two - See, we've got two horm- or aisles. Maybe - .. Maybe we can do that. Yeah.
{VOC breath} I bet that this stuff, the cups and the paper bags and the loose leaf could go here. {VOC breath} Like maybe cups -
and uh -
paper bags. .. Someplace here.
(It could) go there. Okay. {QUAL laughing}
Loose leaf paper. It's uh - {QUAL lengthened} Maybe with the toilet paper.
Okay. {VOC breath} So. .. Should we do the - the big ones first, and make sure -?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
(??) Yeah.
(1x) Kay.
Home. Home stuff, doesn't it?
We can't - We can't move that, though. She said don't move em. Yeah. {VOC breath} (Though) we hafta put this back, I think, yeah?
Cuz that was there. Yeah.
*Camping stuff. And I've got some of that. So - So - So - {QUAL lengthened} .. We could do it over here? Yeah. Pre-cut wood. {VOC breath} B- Books of matches.
(Yeah.)
(And uh) wet suits is with boating.
Yeah. .. Uh-huh.
Here. Yeah.
It should go around pre-cut wood, yeah. This kinda thing.
{VOC laugh} Well - .. Yeah, we can take (the) - .. Yeah. There you go.
That one down there.
Bags of peat moss. Gardening. Maybe way down here.
Yeah.
(??) That's camping, maybe, is it? Or is it more -?
Hold on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Over here, for camping, yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Maybe here. .. Okay. And then the empty plastic jugs, maybe here? And then I'll just put books up with travel guides.
{VOC breath} Okay. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
Yeah, it does. .. Okay, so now we've got clothing and household items. And -
Fir- Yeah, I'm gonna stick - first of all, this right next to the toilet paper, maybe. .. This stuff, there.
Yeah. .. That's okay. Mm-hm.
Well (??) - (or it - ) Cooking supplies. Is there household cooking? I mean -
{VOC start} Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} I would probably get it in the household things, but that's - We don't have a good category for that.
Mm-hm.
We got a problem with refrigerator magnets.
.. {VOC laugh} Um.
Yeah, they did. They did. So we've got all the clothing.
And we might just hafta put that around the pet food. {VOC laugh} .. We don't have a good way to organize.
Oh yeah. That's good.
And then the shoelaces can be part of clothing.
Yeah. .. And - Yeah. There we go.
Okay. .. Okay. And so then we've got all of these - Well, the large vests coulda gone with fishing stuff, but oh well.
Socks. .. Thick sweaters. {VOC breath} Hats. .. And then we've got flags.
*Boat flags maybe. Boating supplies.
Okay. .. Okay, we're done, Heather.
'It's up {PRN sup} to you. {VOC breath} It's up to you.
So, outdoor - .. (Okay.)
Okay h- Where's clothes?
And then gadgets.
Um.
Backpacks, buckets. {VOC breath} {VOC start} And then food is -
Cushions. .. (See.)
Small axes. {QUAL muttering}
{VOC start} .. Uh. {VOC breath} .. {VOC start} (??) Yeah. Canvas bags.
S- This is kinda camping trip stuff.
Rolls of duct tape. I spose -
Yeah, let's - Okay. .. Books.
Um.
Uh, well it depends on what kinda books.
Large vests are .. clothes.
Boxes of doughnuts are food.
{VOC mouthnoise} .. Heavy cable.
Light jackets.
Beets.
Yeah. Tow ropes.
Yeah.
That's probably gonna to be close to the food.
Oh, that's for fishing.
Fleece lined boots is kinda clothes, but - (??)
Yeah, I think.
Gas-powered .. cook stove. .. Yeah.
Box knives.
Half-inch tubing, fishing net. .. Face cream.
Soy beans.
Loose leaf paper.
Okay. So now - .. So let just y- take the food?
Okay.
Liters of water.
(So tell me -)
Mm, okay. {VOC breath}
S- That - {VOC start} ..
The processed stuff. .. Um. .. So.
Okay. {VOC breath}
Sticks of butter would be s- um - .. That's with the -
Oh, the dairy, yes. (You're - ) Kay. .. Cases of whiskey. I spose that's kinda - {VOC mouthnoise}
Yeah. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
Dried figs would be with the -
Yeah, yeah. Beets.
Can of peas.
Boxes of doughnuts.
Well that's - that's - Yeah. Packages of cookies.
Bottles of juice.
Bagels. .. Probably bagels and d- doughnuts.
Pouches of oatmeal. So that's um - {VOC breath} That's with uh -
Chocolate bars. {VOC breath} Well, let's just put it with ice cream.
Bad stuff.
Bottles of water.
I'm gonna put bottles of water and whiskey together. .. And liters of water.
Goes with the peas.
Okay.
Now, are we gonna have enough room? Do we need to -?
To - {VOC breath} .. To uh - .. Like, sugar and cake mix. We're kinda - {VOC start} {VOC start}
And then uh -
We can always move it.
Let's -
Let's do the -
Okay.
Yeah. {VOC breath}
Okay.
Yeah, let's - .. Okay. {VOC start} Go ahead and take some.
So this is the - {VOC breath} the guys.
Boating supplies. {VOC breath} So let's do - I'm gonna - {VOC start} Let's just kinda - {VOC breath}
I'm gonna do fish hooks, five-pound weights.
Fishing net. This is all fishing stuff. .. Half-inch tubing, of course. That's - That has something to do with fishing.
Box knives have something to do with - .. Now, siding has more to do with -
uh, {VOC start}
uh, Home Depot.
So, .. let's - let's put - Ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, can- Okay. Okay.
Oh, okay. Siding.
Okay.
Okay. Oh, here's camping stuff.
Travel guides. Yeah, okay.
Tow ropes. Tha- That's with the fishing.
Small saws. .. That's with the power cord.
Bundles of sticks.
Oh, we can't -
Okay.
Um. .. Bags of peat moss. That -
That's more - Yeah, okay. Let's (go) - Uh, that's gardening. Heavy cable. That's kinda with this.
Rolls of duct tape.
Uh, let's just .. wait on that. Cushions, deck chairs. That's - .. That's there. Buckets.
There.
Backpacks.
That - Okay.
Canvas bags. {VOC breath} .. Small axes. Canvas. {VOC breath} So duct tape would be, to me, with uh,
uh,
uh. {VOC breath} Okay. (That's uh -)
Yeah. That's fine.
Okay. .. Depends on what kinda books you - {VOC breath} Okay.
This is - This is little gadgets.
(Bart -) Okay.
Okay, so. .. This is kinda r- .. Electric heaters. .. Do you know what I wanna do? I wanna put electric heaters .. with this.
So - .. And then the egg timers, to me, would be -
Egg timers would be with the - .. the -
Wouldn't you - Like it's - {VOC start} Wouldn't - Where would you go get a timer?
Well, yeah.
Okay.
Okay. Shoelaces.
Okay. {VOC breath} Scissors. Okay, let's make a little - This is .. kinda - {VOC breath}
Did - Did they put that there or did we? Okay.
Fleece lined book.
Um.
Do you know what? I'm gonna put face cream, tweezers,
scissors - .. Depends on what kinda scissor- {VOC breath} Shoelaces.
Okay. {VOC breath}
An egg timer. .. I - I - I'm actually gonna put the timer over here. .. Kay.
Yeah. .. Heavy coats. Socks.
Flags would be with the pet food. {VOC laugh}
Um. .. Actually - {VOC breath}
Yeah, just put the flags up there. Yeah, okay.
Okay, we're done, Heather.
Okay.
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Well I don't see cooks on there.
Yeah. {VOC breath} .. Uh-huh.
Oh, no. We can't cut that. {VOC laugh} ..
Acti-
Yeah.
For blind students or for- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Football equipment.
I could go with sugar free juice machines. I'm not sure about the assistant cooks. Because we're talking about the school lunches, {VOC breath} .. and the thing is that educational programs have so many um, free and reduced lunch programs.
{VOC breath} And breakfast programs. So, yeah.
That's right. I agree with that.
What about acting coaches?
It is.
Yeah.
Okay. Okay.
Mm-hm.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Uh, football equipment.
Or I've worked at university for too long. {VOC laugh} Okay. {QUAL laughing}
(1x) can see if there are two. Okay.
Hospital additions.
Why?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah. And it's um - {VOC cough} It is important.
{VOC mouthnoise} Uh - All of them kind of are important. But I suppose -
Um. .. I mean, if I knew more about bagel factories, I would know how important, um, {VOC breath} the inspections are. Why that is picked. Is it .. *picked? .. Did they stick it on there just because it was a stand-out that was an obvious one?
But all the rest of em, um - .. Yeah.
That's one I was thinking about.
We just don't know .. the situation. If - Yeah.
{VOC start} We need that. Yeah.
Bagel. The bagel factory inspections. And the hospital additions. {VOC breath} Yeah.
Definitely there's no, um -
I mean, we're assuming that each one of em has the same monetary value, which is hardly the fact, but {QUAL laughing} .. that's okay. {VOC breath} Okay. So on to recreation and public services.
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} .. Well, I could probably vote for football stadium upkeep, if we're gonna vote for football equipment. On the other hand, we may be making enemies by totally {VOC breath} attacking the football folks. If we gave them their stadium upkeep, {VOC breath}
they may forgive us. I was 'wondering {PRN wonding} - There's like four things for animals. Stray cats, kippy- kitten and puppy adoption, {VOC breath} dog catcher, and then veterinary hospital. {VOC breath}
So, I'm wondering why the county needs a veterinary hospital.
Or does it need the hospital for the spaying and the -
I don't know. .. I'm - I'm not sure a county needs a veterinary hospital.
Well my son played soccer. {VOC laugh} Yeah.
Well I would rather have kids off the street and into .. {VOC breath} strong sports, and have s- more stray cats, I guess.
We need that, don't we? .. Yeah?
Food bank we need.
Which of those things can people do without the county funding them? I guess. ..
Maybe 'kitten {PRN cuttin} and puppy adoption? .. Reusable bag campaign?
Maybe.
Yeah. .. That doesn't *require the county. .. Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
That's right. That's ri- And the families can, yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-kay.
I think that's probably too. And I'm thinking taxi stops. Do we *need taxi stops? Does the *county need to {VOC breath} provide those?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. That's true. That's true. I agree with you, yeah. .. Okay.
So do we need to go back and do any more? .. Okay. I think we're done, Heather. Yeah. ..
We wanna not .. eliminate any more than we have to.
So let's - .. let's - .. just go through this. And see if there's anything that just needs to be .. eliminated.
So, (if) education and programs. We need .. the math tutors.
Need to be there.
Assistant cooks. I can't really see - .. Let's just -
That's one thing I'm thinking - {VOC start}
I know. .. So, sex ed is an educa- Custodians.
Speech therapy. .. Football equip-

S- Football equipment.
Poetry books. S- Special ed teachers. .. Cooking classes.
Note-takers, disability - {QUAL muttering}

Uh, sugar free - {VOC breath}
juice machines. .. Book .. keeping classes and music teachers. Okay.
So, is there anything there that you can just .. easily remove?
Okay. Football equipment. And I can easily remove assistant cooks and sugar free juice machines.
Okay, so - Okay. You- Okay. S- .. Okay. {VOC breath} So - {VOC breath} (Sure) {VOC start} 1+
People can drink water. They don't need to drink juice. Okay, so - {VOC breath} So -
Well, that's -
that's uh -
the arts. .. So - {VOC breath} So - So w- there's two.
We can always go back and add more, but - .. take out more, but right now, we wanna eliminate .. this?
Sugar free - {VOC breath} And uh, .. what was the other one?
Oh, football equipment. Yeah, you can tell we're women. {VOC laugh} Okay. {VOC breath} So now, we -
{VOC laugh} Okay. {VOC breath}
So now we're gonna go to the next one. So we definitely hafta get rid of two.
Okay, so public health and safety. Reproduction-
Reproductive education.
Job training programs, chicken pox vaccination, invasive species removal. {VOC breath} S_T_D_, toxic waste disposable .. disposal.
Bagel factory inspections.
Needle exchange, sex offender database.
Veterans medical assistant, far- .. egg farm regulations, weed control, prenatal check-ups, {VOC breath} neighborhoods .. watch support.
Okay, so to me, one that can go off is bagel factory inspections.
Cuz I don't like bagels. {QUAL muttering} {VOC laugh}
Well - .. {VOC start} This - There isn't anything that just -
That just {VOC breath} screams.
You know, like w- like .. we had over here. But, because we took two here, we gotta take two here. .. So now what we hafta do is -
Neighborhood watch support.
That's like Safe Streets.
That's important.
They all are.

All the rest of em are really - I mean, I can't ima-
Hospital additions.
Okay, that's a good w- Okay (the-)

I mean, .. {VOC start} you already have bus stops -
I mean, if you gotta eliminate 'something {PRN suh-m}, eliminate addition-
So. Okay, so we're done that.

Mmhm.
That's the hardware section.

That's all sorta household? That's food, and that - Okay.
So we have half inch tubing over there by the siding.
Mint toothpaste, that would be there in the bathroom, wouldn't it?
I'll let you pull some of them out.

I'd say there.
Small axes, maybe over there by the power cords?
Have a wood section? Cuz here comes bundles of sticks{QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} I'm not quite sure what we use bundles of stick for. {VOC laugh} Bars of soap.{QUAL laughing} Maybe{PRN lengthened i} they're in the kitchen? And now we got our first food. Canned peas, right by the soy, legumes together. So why would you sell empty plastic -? Maybe it is camping. Uh, so if I were going camping I'd be traveling.
{VOC laugh} I thought this said thick sticks at first, and I thought that{QUAL laughing} - {VOC laugh} Uh, do we have a clothing s- Um let's see - Tsk, if I - Well -

Socks I'd put there with the shoes and the shoelaces, and then we have gas powered cook stoves.{QUAL laughing}
Paper 'bags{PRN long}. I say they go to carry lunch to work in, so put em near that. How bout the canvas bags? Grocery shopping, and therefore in the same area?
Egg timers.{QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} We could put em back in the bathroom or we cou-{QUAl laughing} {VOC laugh}

Electric heaters.
Hmm, not in the kitchen.
Not in the bathroom.

And let's see, tow ropes -
Huh.. Over there. Okay, and th- this is - This is another one. {VOC laugh} And our precut wood.
Sounds good to me.. I think we have an empty box.
Okay. {NVC} So -
Boating and siding and power cords. That's hardware.
Here's travel guides, and toys and mouse traps, and then pet food is in with that.
Yeah, and then there's toilet paper, and paper goods I guess, and that's all food.

Let's see how that goes.
Okay.
Yeah.. Yeah.. Right.
{VOC laugh} .. {VOC breath} You bet. (??)

Yeah.. Yeah.
Mmkay.
Yeah.
Beets.
Tool section.
Yeah.
Yeah, we don't have a garden section. These are the same as the lists so we sorta don't - Yeah.. I think so.
Yeah.
Yeah.. Yeah, (??)
Bagels{PRN long first syllable}, yeah.
(Yeah.){QUAL muttering}
Well not to be confused - Yeah, guess it would. Yeah.. She say we could move it? Yeah, she said we could move it.
Yeah.. Yeah.. Right.. That's (??) Broke the rules.
We moved it. Yeah.
Dried figs is -
We're not using this at all, so you wan-
Yeah, so -
Yeah, start putting in the food - more food stuff there.
Hats. Hats would go over here in the -
In the, uh - .. with heavy coats and stuff.
Yeah.
Books of matches would be there.
Easy 'enough{PRN no f}.
Yeah.. That's all the guilty stuff, yeah? Right.
Oh yeah.. that's right. {VOC laugh}
Bottles of juice. Yeah.. {VOC laugh}
Flags. Flags are kinda camping - .. deck chair kinda stuff. How does that sound?
Yeah, we don't{QUAl laughing} - {VOC laugh} Oh, books. Um -
Pet food, okay.
Loose leaf paper. I'll go - {NVC} .. Yeah, r- {VOC laugh}
Small saws. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.. Okay.{QUAL muttering}
Oh.. Hm.
Here's bundles of sticks, small axes, and power cords. Maybe we should just put em there.
Yeah. Huh.
This is a good store.. So, okay.
Yeah.. Yeah.
Yeah.. Good.. Like bottles of juice and whiskey right next to one another. (1x)
Backpacks.. would be -
Mm{PRN long}, travel guides. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. (1x)
Oh, *box knives.
Yeah.
Okay, yeah.
Okay, good. Oh, rolls of duct tape. That's good.. Yeah, that's great.{QUAL muttering}
Tow ropes.. I think that should be over here. That's a heavy duty thing.
Wetsuits, that's going{QUAL laughing} - {VOC breath} That's what we had to have before(QUAL laughing) - Yeah. Precut wood, that's here.
That's a big section. Yeah.. Okay.
Yeah.. Yeah, we did it.
Well. {QUAL rising}
For jus- {VOC start} .. maybe it's in the schools.
Yeah, when I was a kid *we were the assistant cooks.
Well, I would sort of -
Start out with the sugar-free juice machines.
Yeah.
And. {QUAL lengthened}
I'm sorta thinking -
How many are there? There are three, six, nine.
Fifteen. So if we took five from each one it would be a third of a -
{VOC breath} That might be a little excessive, huh?
Okay.
Okay
{VOC laugh} (2x) {QUAL laughing} .. {VOC breath} So .. that makes it a lot easier. Cuz we can get rid of sugar for juice machines.
{VOC start} Well, we can get rid of -
In my opinion we can get rid of football equipment.
{VOC breath} Well, it -
{VOC breath} .. {VOC breath} Yeah.. H- h- home ec.
{VOC start} Well, and I - I don't know if this is adult education as well, it may be, teaching people who are diabetic to cook in a responsible way. {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} .. Um. We like the music teachers. .. Probably math tutors are pretty good. Sex education, I think is critical.
Maybe. .. {VOC breath} We could have the kids in the schools do the assisting. Or they could be custodians.
Yeah.
W- well, quite honestly you probably could cut that one cuz you could just buy Quicken.
{VOC laugh} {VOC start} {QUAL laughing} .. Takes care of it. {VOC laugh}
Well, for starters we're d- going to do the three sugar, football equipment.
And assistant cooks? Okay.
{VOC breath} We did three. We're done.
{VOC laugh} {VOC start} {QUAL laughing} .. {VOC breath} .. Let's see, reproductive education we definitely need that .. Chicken pox vaccinations, I like.
{VOC breath} Invasive species removal, I'm in favor of.
S_T_D_ we definitely need that. {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Toxic waste disposal, gosh we kinda need that. .. {VOC mouthnoise} .. Hospital additions. {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Probably need that. {VOC breath}
Well, I - you know, I don't like bagels so it'd be fine with me if we didn't do bagel factory inspections. {VOC laugh}
{VOC mouthnoise} Well maybe they inspect them for kosherness, I dunno.
Yeah.
Well they wanna know if we say bagel {PRN bag ul} like my sister does in New York City. {VOC laugh} Yeah. She says bagel. {PRN bag ul} {VOC laugh} Needle exchange, we'd like that. I think a sex offender database is really pretty useless quite honestly but {VOC mouthnoise} .. Veteran's medal. Well, you can't cut that cuz then the (human cry) would go off.
{VOC breath} Egg farm regulations. .. {VOC breath} Well, neighborhood watch support, I'm afraid they've cut that already.
I was gonna say neighbors do it, we - on their own, yeah. So we're - we can get rid of that one, can't we? And then we - I'm happy to get rid of bagel factories. Yeah. Yeah. So we just have to find one more.
{VOC mouthnoise} Well and I guess if I were looking at this I'd look at hospital additions.
Children's has just finished theirs, they don't need another one. {VOC laugh}
Yeah, yeah. .. {VOC mouthnoise} .. {VOC mouthnoise}
Yeah. I agree. I agree. .. {VOC breath} *Now. We did three there. {VOC mouthnoise} So recreation and public services. .. {VOC breath} Let's see. What is a public news sta-? Oh, is that like K_ U_ O_ W_?
Oh yeah!
Get on. {VOC laugh} Yeah. {QUAL laughing} One in the nude as I recall. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Well if it's that I could get rid of that. That would be alright with me. I wouldn't wanna get rid of K_U_O_W_. {VOC breath} .. Uh.
Yeah. And, I dunno. Junior soccer league. I dunno if we need that.
Um, well here. I think the boys' basketball club. They don't have a girls' anything.
So I think we c- don't fund that until they make it co-ed. Yeah. Yeah. {VOC breath} Um. P- {VOC breath}
Oh, okay.
Oh okay, let's get rid of the public access. Yeah. There's - we don't need that. .. {VOC breath} Um.
See, I'm not a big football fan. I'd probably get rid of the football stadium upkeep.
Pest control we need, spaying we need. .. {VOC breath} Uh, food banks we need. Kitten and puppy adoption I guess we don't need but we've got all those puppies and kittens because nobody's spaying.
And neutering their cats. {VOC breath}
It is, yeah.
Yeah.
That's where we've gotten all our pets. {VOC laugh} .. Soup kitchens we need. Housing assistance.
Well, I th- how about boys' basketball and leave junior soccer? It's very popular now and -
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then, uh -
The public access.
Mm-hm. {VOC mouthnoise} .. And then we can choose betw- as far as I'm concerned, either football stadium -
Or - {QUAL lengthened}
Huh.
Veterinary hospital. Why would we have to be supporting the veterinary hospital if we're supporting the spaying and neutering?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I c- I could cut the veterinary hospital probably.
Is that our three? Okay.
{VOC laugh} Oh, licensing. {VOC laugh} .. Well, pothole maintenance we definitely need. Uh.
Subway system. Interesting, since we don't have one really in Seattle. But - {VOC breath} .. {VOC start}
May- well, then we'd like that. Well, could we agree on flagpole repair not being the highest priority?
Way down there. Okay, so that's one we could get rid of.
{VOC breath} Um. Additional bus stops. Since they're cutting our bus services right and left maybe we don't need additional stops.
Well as long as they're not funding the busses, it doesn't do much good. {QUAL laughing} .. Might be chicken and egg, I don't know. Now, what is a massage certificate? Is that a license to practice massage therapy? {VOC mouthnoise} .. {VOC breath} .. Oh, I suppose {PRN spossss} .. What's the greater public good? Fishing licenses, massage certificates, tattoo artist licenses?
Speed limit signs, I guess we need cuz people keep -
Now, why do we have to pay for taxi stops?
Okay.
No.
Right.
Yeah, I was gonna say the - the port oughta run that. Okay. So we're gonna get rid of taxi stops and flagpole repair.
And then what else, do we think we could do? Additionally bus stops?
Is that okay? .. Alright. That's our three.
We're done.
{VOC laugh} Good liberals that we are. {QUAL laughing} ..  {VOC laugh} .. {VOC breath} ..
{VOC mouthnoise} Oh, somebody would. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Hm. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} What do you think, starting on the first one, what do you think assistant cook ..  involves?
I dunno what that means. In school. I guess that's in schools. .. In the schools that they had more people in the lunch room. .. Yeah.
Ah, yeah.
Mm.
Yeah, I would t- I agree. I agree. I think those are nice, but it's not something you really - I mean all these other things need it - need it more if we use that. Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm. {VOC breath}
Oh, we try for three.
See if that goes. Then if we can't handle that we'll just - {VOC laugh} .. {VOC start} .. {VOC breath} .. Yeah. Yeah.
{VOC start} Absolutely. We know that's true.
{VOC start} Yeah, I think that's true because there are any number of sources for that money. .. Um.
Although you don't wanna go to those sources. There they are.
And, um. I also think that, um -
Uh, I was gonna say cooking classes. But that's I guess that's actually really useful stuff. I - I grew up with that and, I mean, our high school had .. home ec. {VOC breath} Yeah.
Yeah that's it. Yeah. .. {VOC start} Yeah, yeah. You're right.
Mm-hm.
So maybe it's the assistant cooks. {VOC breath}
Yeah.
Yeah. This is interesting because we're uh - volunteering at our neighborhood elementary school. You can see all this stuff, going into the big public - big public, you know elementary school. It's really fun. {VOC breath} I mean, bookkeeping classes. {VOC start} That's a real skill. I just -
I don't - like, it sounds more like a - it sounds like a high school class, or so- well, I guess you just don't fund it cuz you'd have to get someone.
{VOC laugh} You could, yeah. .. Yeah. .. Uh.
{VOC start} Sugar. .. Football equipment.
Yeah. Okay. So we did three. We did three. Okay. Alright. {VOC laugh}
Alright. {VOC breath} Mm.
Hm.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Mh-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah. {VOC breath}
{VOC start} Why do we need to inspect bagel factories?
{VOC laugh} Is there some particular reason why bagel factories in particular are being singled out for being cut? It's jus-
Yeah, but it doesn't - I mean bakeries are bakeries and, you know they - they don't -
They get r- they get the regular, um, health inspection.
{VOC laugh} Ba- really? Says bagel? {PRN bag ul} Huh. Huh.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. {VOC breath} Attra- yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
{VOC breath} Yeah, and it's something that you can {VOC start} it depends on what you're funding. If you're funding somebody to organize it or make it happen. .. It still happens.
Neighbors do it anyway.
Okay, so we got one.
Uh, bagels. That's two.
Hm. {VOC breath}
Additions. I would, too. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, right. {VOC laugh} They've just, they've got a big one. Yeah. Well, it means, yeah, it means they have to go to private sources instead of government.
But, I think not building a wing in a hospital is -
W- uh - is - is - I mean, th- that's okay compared to removing some of these other things. I mean, it's really - yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Mm-kay we did three there. Three there. Okay. Oh.
Hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Um, I'm wondering if - public news station. I'm wondering if it's like the thing - the s- someone was reminding me of this yesterday that Seattle had this thing that was an open station. Do you remember that on television? On cable? And anybody could sign up. And you had all these wackos that were there doing half hour shows. Um. I don't - Yes. Yes. I don't know if, um, that's what it means.
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
Yeah. .. You're right.
Food bank you gotta keep. Yeah. (Alright).
Soccer league.
Mm .. kitten and puppy adoptions. (2x) {QUAL whispered}
Oh. Very good. Yeah.
Until they have boys *and girls. Okay. Good. Yeah. .. Public access station is the same idea as what I was talking about. So, one of those. Public news station and public access station. That's - that, that was called public access TV. Let's get rid of that. Yeah. .. Yeah. .. Yeah.
{VOC laugh} .. {VOC breath} Yeah. .. Yeah.
Yeah, right.
Yeah. .. It's actually a huge service.
I mean, yeah. We've been in to see that and it's really. Yeah. .. Yeah, right. Exactly. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} .. Mm-kay, so we have junior soccer guard - did we cut junior soccer league?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Junior soccer league sounds co-ed. .. Yeah. .. Uh, but boys' basketball club does not.
And.
Uh, what'd we say? Th- oh, the public access station and the boys' basketball club.
Reuse.
Mm-hm.
Veterinary hospital.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's not something that the county would run. I mean, there's private ones.
That's interesting. Okay. {VOC laugh} Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We've got - we've got three. Yeah. We did it.
Yeah. Oh, boy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That might be the money for building them. Or planning them. Yeah.
{VOC start} Yeah. Way. {VOC start} Way down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. .. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, I dunno why you would need additional stops, or money for additional stops.
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah.
Huh.
Yeah.
That's a licensing thing. Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, that means that, yeah. They keep knocking them down and st- stuff.
Well, I don't underst- I would take - that's one of my first candidates. It really is. Because taxi stops, uh, exist in places, and they're useful. But nobody u- I mean, we're talking about Seattle. They don't really get used. I mean, in *some places. There's huge lines for them in airports. You have a specialized - but the airport runs that.
Yeah. Yeah. {VOC start} Taxi stops.
Flagpole m- repair.
{VOC breath } .. {VOC breath} .. Yeah additional bus stops for sure. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. We did it, we did it!
And we're cutting!
But nothing very vital.
You look at this and see, see how- yeah, and see - {VOC start} and see what the uh - constituency is. .. I mean, who's gonna go out and protest about flagpole maintenance? Right?
Not gonna happen. Somebody will, but they can go out and paint the darn pole themselves. (Alright?)
Oh, just one at a time! One at a time. They said one at a time.
So here, stick those back in here.
{VOC laugh} Just pick one at a time. {QUAL laughing}
I don't know. That's - that's how I read the rules, anyway. {NVC throughout}
Okay. {NVC} Alright. {NVC} Just {NVC} pull one out. {NVC} {VOC breath}
Okay, well - {VOC breath} 'It {PRN glottal stop} looks we have better organization than we did on our lists. So -
Do you think we should group the foods together? Should we put the preserve foods.. differently from the fresh foods?
You know, these are -
These are groceries. (There's) definitely *groceries.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, they're probably dried, would be my guess.
{NVC} Yeah, that looks like a good choice to me.
Okay. Alright.
'Fish {PRN ish} hooks, that looks like it would probably go pretty much right there.
With the boating supplies.
Thick sweaters. Oh, we get to pick that ourselves.
'Should we {PRN /ʃʊwɪ/} put clothes in the middle?
Okay, toys - {QUAL lengthened, quiet}
Well, there was paper and scissors that could maybe be grouped with that.
Um, so these are sorta more sundries, I think?
So yeah, maybe h-
We have bathroom supplies, that kinda stuff. So that could go here, mm-hm.
So we'll put the clothes here, sort of opposite some of the travel stuff?
Okay.
'No. {PRN mm-no}
Mm-kay, electric heaters.
So that's kind of household items, maybe?
Maybe could go on this side with the mousetraps?
These are more sporting and hardware, perhaps?
What do you think? {VOC breath}
Mm-kay, we'll try that.
Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah, kinda house -
Care, garden care -
Sorts of stuff. Empty plastic jugs. That looks (??) like we need a recycling bin, but we {QUAL laughing} don't have one.
Okay, so that's gonna be.. I would think with -
Would that be more of a sport thing or more of up with the refrigerator magnets? {VOC breath} This would be, like -
You know, just for carrying around a *drink. No, we have to do this one. {QUAL laughing on 'do this one'}
I'll put it up here with the empty plastic bags with refrigerator magnets.
Mm - mm-kay.
Yeah.
{NVC} I think so. {VOC breath} 'Unless {PRN less} we go with {NVC} electric heaters, but that's more *appliances. {NVC} This {NVC} is more - {NVC}
Do it yourself.
Liters of water. {VOC breath} How bout that? Would that go near the plastic jugs? Or do you think it would go -
In the refrigerated unit? {VOC breath}
(They don't) *have to be refrigerated.
They have thrown some things in here that were not on our list.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
So should we put that in this group?
Okay.
Okay, w- yeah, maybe we'll have 'something {PRN /sə̃m̩/} else we wanna stick {NVC} in there.
Small *axes.
'Okay. {PRN mokay}
Heavy coats!
Somewhere in here?
{NVC} Gas-powered cookstoves. {QUAL long s} That - {QUAL long release burst}
Hm. {VOC breath} Gas-powered cookstoves.
(Yeah), it's definitely an outdoor thing. {QUAL muttering}
How bout here?
{NVC} Kay.
Grab and go. {VOC breath}
Kay, face cream. Hm, looks like it should go there. {NVC}
'Okay, {PRN hokay} so five-pound weights. Are those sport things or are those, um, hardware things?
A fishing weight?
Okay.
Oh, look! Here's something to go with it. Fishing net, yay!
Okay, loose-leaf paper. {VOC breath}
Paper and pet food?
Or -
Maybe closer to the toys.
So maybe in this section where the clothes are farm- forming up?
We had boots and stuff, too, and they're gonna probably end up in there.
Sticks of 'butter. {PRN buttah}
Over here?
Yeah. That's the refrigerated stuff.
'Bars {PRN ars} of soap. Okay, rolls of duct tape.
Rolls of duct 'tape. {PRN popped release burst}
Oh.
*Could be in this section. {VOC breaht} Yeah.
Large cups. So that'd be, like, paper.
Dried figs. {QUAL whispering on 'figs'}
{VOC start} This section?
Soy beans?
Heavy cable.
On our list I think it was there. Or, one list or the other.
Or was that the tow rope?
Okay. Scissors, probably up here?
Bagels. Where would you put bread? Bread would be near the -
'Packages {PRN /pækəʃ/} of cookies or near the cake mix.
Okay.
Case of whiskey, grab and go.
Socks.
Half-inch tubing. {VOC breath}
(Over in the) -
Okay.
Box knives.
Huh, kind of a tool thing. Hats.
Mint toothpaste.
If it wasn't *mint, we'd have to put it over here. {NVC} (??).
Cushions for *deck chairs. *That's the kinda cushions.
Yeah, could still just go in this section.
Yeah. {VOC breath} Okay, fleece-lined boots. {QUAL lengthened s}
Wai- wait, wait. This is fresh -
So let's put the fresh stuff on this side. {NVC} Okay.
Buckets.
Over here? I'm thinking hardware-type buckets.. {NVC} Yeah.
Okay, egg timer. {VOC breath}
We don't have that yet.
Not yet.
(But that's) kind of a -
Tool, a house tool? Yeah.
Chocolate bars.
Boy, our grab and go section and our bathroom section's filling up fast.
Bottles of juice.
W- should that go in the cooler?
(I don't know), just because we're - (2x) kinda -
Running out of space around some of these columns
Backpacks.
Light jackets? {QUAL long s}
Small saws.
That'd go over there. {QUAL quiet}
Canvas bags
Over {QUAL long r} here, maybe?
Yeah.
Maybe. I mean, we still have the -
Pouches of oatmeal. I think that would go in *this section here.
Boxes of doughnuts.
Let's - let's change *this. Let's put the - this one down here by the pet food.
Okay. Flags.
Books of matches.. maybe that goes in this section too.. You think? Yeah. {VOC mouthnoise}
Wetsuits.
Yeah, that could go back to back with the boating supplies.
And books. {NVC}
{NVC} Tow ropes.
Well, we're pretty low in the *food department.
We're done!
Yeah, and refrigerated items -
Non-refrigerated food items.. toiletries.. f- clothing type stuff.
Backpacks *could be moved, but, you know, that's probably okay there.
{VOC mouthnoise} Office-y stuff and kid toys, wetsuits, books - {QUAL long s}
Household sort-of equipment-y things -
And then all the sporting and outdoor and hardware stuff.. Yeah! I think we've got it.
I think we have a *much better store than we started out with.
We're all in agreement on that.
One at a time?
Okay.
Oh.
Okay. Pull one out. {VOC breath}
Okay.
Cans of peas.
Over he-
We - (1x) much better!
Um -
These are refrigerated. These are refrigerated.
Box.
Bag.
Soybeans. We don't know if those are -
Dried.
I would say canned peas would be going over here some place.
Okay.
We'll leave space to put more.
Fish hooks! Boating supplies?
Okay.
Thick sweaters. Where was -
Okay! Let's put clothes in the middle?
Yeah. There were toys. I don't remember that much else to go with toys.
Okay.
Oh, and we also have to have space for the bathroom supplies. Okay, there's the bathroom there.
Thick s-
Yeah.
Cuz I don't think it would go - i- tha- to me, that's more refrigerated - siding -
'Unless {PRN less} (1x) - {VOC mouthnoise} No.
Um -
We- I would th- you could put it down with mousetraps.
Yeah.
Bag of peat moss. My {QUAL laughing} favorite.
*I think it should go with, uh -
'The {PRN devoiced th} siding, outdoors.
Yeah.
Uh -
Empty plastic -
Let's do a different one! {VOC breath}
Okay.
Pre-cut wood.. Outdoors -
With outdoors?
Yeah.
We don't have any -
Yeah I don't think so. Um -
I think there were nuts?
(1x) - there w- there were, um -
Figs.. There w- there - there was -
Easy grab - what I would say was -
Food for - for the trail.
Li- liters of water would be f- food for the trail.
Where do you think? {VOC breath}
Um -
We could put it right up - uh, right afterwards.
We knew this to begin with. {QUAL laughing}
Reproductive education.
Okay, so if we ta- A_, we have to cut equal numbers from each one, so -
Football equipment. {NVC}
Acting coaches.
I think we *might need those.
Sugar-free -
I - we had talked about cutting the classes, {VOC hesitation} and I don't know whether we wanna stick with that idea or not.
So, if we - if we cut sex ed here -
And -
Football equipment?
Acting coaches.
Um, and sugar-free machines. That's four.
So let's see if four ends up being a good number for all {NVC} of them.
Keeping reproductive education.
Are we.. cancelling it?
Well yeah, but w- I'm not sure we can -
Do we get to plan that? We have to -
Maybe that's our *thinking. Maybe that's our thinking. {VOC laugh}
Okay.
Okay, so there's one, and reproductive education we're keeping. Let's see, which one did we decide - ? So, if we're cutting S_T_D_ education -
Yeah, can we get rid of four things? Oh, hospital *additions we were gonna cut.
Uh, I don't know. Can we get rid of weed control?
Then we can get rid of weed control. So we need one more, if we're gonna do four.
Yeah, you could certainly be -
Uh, we figured we should keep all that.
Okay, well we've got three so far from this group.
Uh -
(Well), maybe three. Maybe we only end up being able to cut three.
Spaying.
'Reusable {PRN reezable} bag campaign?
Well, okay. So.. um -
So that - boy, I really hate cutting that - {VOC hesitation} the -
Effort to support people i- by providing the food bank. I just - {VOC mouthnoise} {QUAL regretful}
Food bank or soup kitchen.
One of those two things I think the county should keep.
'Cuz {PRN hz} we've got housing assistance, so which is more valuable? The soup kitchens are sorta for the homeless people more so, and the food bank is more for people who have a place to cook.
Um. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}
So, {VOC breath} maybe the soup kitchen is more of a *county function, cuz 'there's {PRN thiz} public health involved with *that, whereas with the food bank you're handing out packaged things.
So maybe we can let a non-profit take over the food bank.
Keep the f- keep the soup kitchen.
Um.
But get rid of - which one did you suggest, the public news station?
Public news station -
And food bank.
Um, did we also say the adoptions?
Or -
{VOC mouthnoise} Outsourcing that.
Okay.
Dog catcher. So there's three things right there.
{VOC breath} Pest control we need, veterinary hospital I suppose we need.
Uh, football stadium upkeep - {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
So the 'reusable {PRN reezable} bag campaign -
I mean, that *is good for the environmental.. issues that it brings up.. Okay, so we've got -
Three, three for that.
Okay, infrastructure and licensing.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And the taxi stops.
So, there's three in each category except this we had *four, so we can add one back in.
So, let's see, assistant cooks, sex ed, (??) - {QUAL reading to self}
We could ei- keep the sugar-free juice machines.
Um, let's see, which ones did we decide to get rid of? We got rid of {VOC start} the sex ed -
And.. was it the football equipment?
And the acting coaches.
W- yeah, we - okay, so we - we didn't make that choice.
Mm-hm.
Football equipment? Does the county need to provide that?
Not so sure. It's also -
Well that could also be girls *and boys, whereas this is - football's just boys.
So.
So, sex ed, football equipment -
Mm, the acting coaches we thought were maybe optional.
And the sugar-free juice machines, we keep that for - for their health purposes, and get rid of the acting coaches?
You like Coke, do you?
So, should we.. knock that one out? That's not a county cost, anyway.
So then we're down to three. So then we keep the coach.
The acting coach.
Okay, so we're down to three in each category then.
I wonder how much money we're saving the county? {VOC breath}
I think we - we made our decision about it.
No, they just said we had to do the same number.
Mm-hm.
Maybe we're supposed to discuss each *item. We didn't discuss each {NVC} item in absolute {NVC} detail like we did over there. {NVC} I mean - you {NVC} know, there were things -
Like, the neighborhood watch support we thought was valuable for -
Everything.. Pre-natal checkups is something, you know, for public health.
I thought I heard the door.
Uh, regulations. We need that.
We have to support the veterans.
Sex offender database. Needle exchange, really important for public health. And the inspections are important. {NVC}
Right.
Right. Toxic waste disposal's really important.
We decided S_T_D_ education could be grouped in with reproductive education, right?
Uh, we're gonna keep the 'invasive {PRN ins- vasive} species removal and the vaccinations, job training programs, and reproductive education.
Uh, I think we discussed everything under public, uh, services.
And we decided what to keep and what not to keep on there. Um -
This one we didn't go through in detail, infrastructure and licensing. We decided to keep the teaching certificates.
All the public safety signage.. not {VOC start} increase the bus stops -
We decided to keep the licensing as well. Tattoo artist, boating licenses.
Keep the standards high. Pothole maintenance, *subway, of course. Hunting tags are important. *Towing services are important. Certificates for massage.
Flagpole repair, not so important. Taxi stops, not so important
Fishing licenses, keeping the buses up, and keeping the drainage ditches in good repair, that all seems very -
Important.
Yep.
Yep. {VOC breath}
Um.
'Is there {PRN sr} anything we missed?
'Education {PRN /tʃkeʃn̩/} programs -
Um.
Notetakers for disability services. That's the only thing there *is for disability, so -
In the whole list, so definitely need to -
Serve their needs.
Well good!
I think we've got a plan. {VOC breath}
I don't know.
Maybe we weren't clear enou- were we clear enough?
Okay, so I.. can see -
So we need to keep.. math tutors, assistant cook-
Sex ed.
We put that under s-
Public health and safety.
Yeah, we - yeah, we -
Okay.
So we count.. 'sex {PRN ssssex} ed -
Two.
Three.
Poetry books in the library?
*I think - *I (2x) go with those, too.
Sugar-free machi-
Mm-hm?
Football equipment, yeah.
Mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay.
Okay.
And cancelling s- S_T_D_ education.
Ke- well, w- those three went to one.
Sex e-
It's in *my book, we ca- {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
*My book, we can!
Okay, um. Hospital additions, we're not expanding at the moment.
Okay -
Yeah.
If we keep invasive species removal - we keep that, we can get rid of weed control.
Yeah.
Cuz weed control can go under 'invasive - {PRN /ɪ̃vɛʃɨz/} invasive s- species.
{VOC start} Put up there, {VOC breath} yeah.
'Pre-natal {PRN pre-nattle} checkups was - we put that with the chicken pox vaccination.
And the needle exchange.
'We {PRN reduced/devoiced} put that under th-
Yeah, that was w- under (2x), okay.
Three.
Um. {VOC mouthnoise}
Okay.
So we're gonna keep the k-
Spaying f- 'we're {PRN devoiced} cutting the food bank. {PRN back}
Junior league soccer.
I would cut a lot of - yeah, here.
Cut the adoption, the soup kitchens -
Uh, we outsourced the dog catcher.
'Oh, {PRN /ɛ:/} I think that's probably good.
But that could go under -
We could've -
Public news station and public access station -
Betcha we could cut public *news station and keep the public 'access - {PRN /ækstɛ/} access station.
(Okay).
Which one?
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
And keep the soup k-
Okay.
I (woulda) suggested the public news station.
Yeah.
Yeah, we were sending kitty and puppy 'adopti- {PRN /əbdapʃ/} adoptions - outsourcing that to -
Um -
We were outsourcing dog catcher.
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
Three for that w-
Kay.
We were gonna get rid of the additional bus stops.
The flagpole repair.
And the taxi stops.
So there's three.
Okay, so we had -
Um -
And the football equipment.
And the acting coaches.
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay, I still think we can get rid of sex ed because we got it over there under reproductive health. (??)?
Kay.
Um {VOC mouthnoise} we need math tutors, we need the assistant cooks to help.
We need custodians keeping -
Speech therapy, w-
'It's {PRN s} expensive.
But I think it's - it's - i- it's, um -
I'd rather ha-
Cut football -
And keep -
Junior soccer, because that's less expensive.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
So -
Sex e- football equipment.
Yeah.
No, I'd r-
No, I'd rather get rid of the.. juice machine and keep the *acting coaches.
I don't think it sh- I don't think it should - {VOC start} *any of it should be in the - in the schools
I mean, when *I was in school they didn't have it. I don't think they really need it!
And why is the county prov- providing them?
I mean, um -
I'd knock that out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
We're good.
I don't know. {QUAL laughing}
'Unless {PRN less} it was telling us to - that we had to cut five or four?
We just have to be the - do the same number, yeah.
Oh!
That's true.
Right.
'Weed {PRN we} control you need.
Oh.
You need - {VOC start}
Yeah, you need that.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
That goes with the, uh, egg farm regulations and -
Keeping the food healthy.
Uh, we don't need to expand hospitals at this time.
Any toxic was- mm - I guess we need to do - take care of.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Uh-huh!
So, under -
'Right. {PRN mright}
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Yeah, because it brought money in. We need to keep the 'potholes {PRN 'p' unreleased} maintained.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, w-
No.
No, th- y- right.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Because that's, uh f- for water.. runoff, yeah.
I don't think so.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I wonder if they count things differently?
*I think we're clear enough.
Hats.
I don't see any clothing {QUAL lengthened}
Yeah, the sides look like they are also aisles.
Um. Let's see.
I would say could put clothing in this area sort of near the -
Travel guides and -
Okay.
Alright. I've got some tweezers.
That's - .. Sort of toiletries, beaut- health and beauty. Which goes well with the toilet paper.
Here's the refrigerated section it looks like. With the ice cream and eggs.
Alright.
Alright. I have beets.
Which - .. Those are vegetables - produce. So I'm gonna put them with the soy beans. .. So right underneath the - .. Soybeans.
Alright. I've got a couple liters of water here.
That could either be food or sorta utilities sorta things.
Um.
Yeah. I'll go ahead and put it - uh -
With the - yeah, I'll put it beneath the bottles of juice, because -
Yeah. With liquids.
(Lemme) grab a few more things off this truck.
Let's put it with the boating supplies. People need flags on their boats.
I have some cases of whisky. .. *Cases. .. Of whisky.
Ah, let's see.
I wanna put these -
Mm.
We'll go ahead and put it with the juice and the water.
Liquids with liquids.
I would say that goes near the cake mix.
Okay. .. Now we have some paper bags.
Which seems like they go well sort of -
With -
The power cords here.
Probably better with the mouse traps.
(I'm gonna) put them right underneath {QUAL lengthened} the mouse traps
Alright. .. I have some box knives which go really well with the power cords. I'm gonna put them .. right above those power cords.
Yes. A whole aisle of things you can hurt yourself with.
Let's see - Wetsuits. Which are more recreational than just regular clothing so le-
Yeah. I'm gonna put em right underneath the boating supplies.
Yeah.
Alright. Fish hooks go .. fairly well with the -
Wetsuits and boating supplies. It's going to be underneath those two.
Yeah. You do.
And some small saws. .. Let's go ahead and put those with the rest of the sharps. Right above the small axes.
Yeah.
Alright. I've got some electric heaters. Which, that seems to go hand and hand with the power cords. .. So I'm gonna put that right underneath the power cords.
Let me grab a few more.
Yeah.
Works for me.
I've got some books of matches which -
If we're continuing in that sorta camping theme - .. I'm gonna put them above the bundles of sticks.
That sounds good. I've got some rolls of duct tape which I'm just gonna put underneath the siding here. Cuz you can use one to repair the other.
Alright.
I have some large vests.
Which, we have a clothing section. I'm putting it right underneath the fleece lined boots.
Yeah.
And I have some five pound weights.
Which .. let's go ahead and .. {VOC start} we'll put that .. underneath the rolls of duct tape.
In that sorta utilities section.
Yeah.
I have sticks of butter which seem to go well just underneath the sugar.
Mm-hm.
Alright. Mint toothpaste.
Will go -
Uh we'll put it underneath the tweezers, in that sorta health and beauty section.
Oh yes.
I - gas powered cook stoves.
Let's go ahead and put that underneath the electric heaters.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Face cream I'm gonna go ahead and put above the toilet paper.
Alright.
Bags of peat moss.
We don't really have a gardening section so I'm just gonna put it with the paper bags and mouse traps. As things you find in the garage.
And then I've got loose leaf paper.
Which we don't really have an office supply section but - yeah, they can go with the travel guides.
{VOC start} I've got some packages of cookies.
Which I'm gonna go ahead and put with the pouches of oatmeal. As sorta that prepackaged .. deal.
There we go.
I've got some backpacks. Which go great with loose leaf paper.
Alright. .. I've got some empty plastic jugs. Which are fairly utilitarian but still sli- somewhat miscellaneous.
So we'll put that with the canvas bags. It's looking like it's just .. things that carry other things.
Alright.
Bagels. I'm going to put underneath the package of cookies.
Mm-kay. I've got some egg timers that I'm putting with the larger cups, just above the there.
Yeah.
Alright. .. I've got some light jackets that will go great -
Right over those thick sweaters. So you can (label) that so - then - (I'm) putting those right underneath the thick sweaters.
Alright.
And across and dow-  up from cases of whiskey. So also celebratory.
So looks like we're done.
So, first out of the truck. .. What do we have? .. Let's do hats.
Hats. Is there any clothing anywhere else? .. um.
Suppose we can just make a place.  .. So I think - .. Like the sides count as aisles too.
Okay. So we can just choose one for clothing maybe.
Some.
Or maybe like this - this aisle is al- almost all empty.
So I think there's -
So {QUAL lengthened} food looks like it's over here on this side.
More like -
Useful stuff like -
(3x) Like construction, boating supplies.
So clothing -
What do you think?
Maybe.
On the -
Sounds good.
So travel guides on like the first like full column maybe. Let's put that up - up at the top. .. Since hats - hats go on your head.
Tweezers. .. Alright.
Okay.
There we go, let's do that.  So right underneath the toilet paper. .. Alright. So next uh bottles of juice.
Um bottles of juice. So we have food stuffs - .. Um.
Oh. .. That -
That would be very good. Ice cream's frozen so let's put that bottles of juice underneath the eggs. That's a - I see that in the grocery store sometimes.
Beets. Alright. So -
Produce.
Yep. So -
Sure. Sounds good.
Sounds good. I've got some shoe laces next. So I pulled those out of a random box. Um. Those -
Can go with clothing stuff. So I'm going to put ne- with the hats at the top of the -
Left side of the store.
Okay.
Cool. Yeah, like supplies and stuff.
Um. I think - .. You may as well just put it with like - .. the other - .. like the other - like food stuffs.
Consumables
Sure. Sounds good. They're both liquids that - that - that counts.
Alright. So I've got flags next. So where do we wanna put some patriotic stuff?
Alright. .. Yeah. .. There we go. That's a good idea. So right above the boating supplies.
Ooh. Very nice. Not - not - not just - not just normal whisky
Alright.
Okay. .. Keep liquids with liquids.
Sounds good. .. So I've got some pouches of oatmeal. Um. Those can probably go in like near the cake mix, maybe.
So right un- right underneath the cake mix in the right of the store.
Paper bags. Kay.
Sure.
Sure. Sounds good.
That'll work.
(I've) got some heavy coats next. So those'll go up with the - .. up with the clothing aisle. So near to the hats and shoe laces on the other side of the aisle from the travel guides.
Box knives.
I'm th- I'm thinking yeah.
(Go and) grab a couple more.
Um. And I have some small axes which would probably go very good with the box knives as well.
Alright.
I think they go near the boating supplies. That sounds good.
{VOC start} Just incase you fall in.
Alright. So I've got socks next. Um. Socks are gonna go up `in {PRN win} the clothing aisle. So near the heavy coats and shoe laces and hats and stuff.
Very good. Very good.

I'll put those (where) the socks. Cuz you gotta kinda wear those together, so.
Kay.
Sounds good. Alright. So I've got  some - .. Bundles of sticks. So those are probably good -
As like uh for like fire wood and stuff so.
Um. Maybe a - .. patriotic bonfire. Um. {VOC start} Near the flags and boating supplies.
Kay.
Oh. Very good. Very good.
Sounds good. .. {VOC start}
Alright. Got some large cups next. So those'll probably go in uh -
Where should I put those? Maybe with like - .. Kitchen supplies near the refrigerator magnets there.
Sounds good. Near the middle of the store.
Sounds good.
Got some cans of peas next. So peas are g- small green {VOC start} circular things. I'll put those with the soy beans.
Sure. Gotta -
Stick stuff together. Sounds good.
Alright. Got some pre-cut wood. So that would go up there but we're looking a little crammed up in that corner of the store -
So I'm gonna put some with the sidings. .. Wood siding maybe.
Sounds good.
Alright. Got a fishing net. That'll go great with the fish hook and wet suits and boating supplies
Kay.
Sure.
Sounds good. .. I've got some thick sweaters so that'll - those'll go nice with the large vests. Gotta get extra warm.
Very good. .. Awesome.
Got some heavy cable next. That sounds pretty utility-ish.
So I'll do that over there. On that side of the store.
Oh.
Sounds good.
Sounds good. Gotta get some bars of soap there too. So. .. Gotta - gotta stay clean.
Grab some more stuff off the truck.
Alright.
Yeah. .. Gotta keep warm while you're cooking.
Sounds good. Got some chocolate bars.
Maybe put those above the sugar. That sounds like a good idea.
Sounds good. Got some half inch tubing that'll go over on the far left side with the heavy cable, five pound weights.
All the other utility stuff.
Alright.
Sure. Why not.
Got some canvas bags. Um. Let's see, where should I put those?
Maybe.
With just miscellaneous stuff with the bags of peat moss and paper bags {QUAL laughing}
Kay.
Maybe. .. Maybe near the travel guides?
Sounds good.
I have some dried figs. Those are - .. kinda produce-y - .. So I'll put those with the - underneath the beets with the soy beans.
Oh.
Very tasty.
Sounds good.
Yeah. .. Yeah. That's a good idea.
Alright. I've got some buckets. Um. Where should I put these buckets? Buckets'll probably go in the utility area so.
Underneath the half inch tubing and heavy cable.
Kay.
Oh. Yep. School supplies. Gotta get them (travel ta-) guides.
Alright. So. Tow ropes. Um those would probably be good with boating supplies but since that area of the store is pretty crammed up -
Um. And I won't shove it in the middle of the aisle. Um. I'll just put those underneath buckets.
Yeah.
Alright. So, I've got some scissors next. S- A nice shipment of scissors here.
Um, let's put those near the backpacks. Gotta get kids ready for school.
Sounds good.
I've got some books. Those'll go great with uh travel guides. In like the literature section maybe there, up above the loose leaf paper.
Kay. .. I've got some cushions for deck chairs. Um those are -
Let's see, those are probably good - .. Miscellaneous stuff cause we already used up the boating area. So those'll be right above mouse traps and paper bags.
Sounds good.
Very nice. And the last thing we have. Uh. Celebratory box of doughnuts. Um, let's put those -
Near the cake mix and the butter.
On the right side of the store.
Alright. And looks like our -
Ooh yeah. .. Oh yeah.
Yep.
Let's just go left to right.
Math tutors.
Math tutors are pretty important.
Yeah.
Um. Assistant cooks.
Yeah. {VOC laugh}
Yeah. Uh we're not going to cut sex ed. {VOC breath} That is a bad idea.
Let's not cut the custodians either.
Yeah.
Football equipment.
Yeah. And if they have - if they're using sub-par equipment that could be a public health risk.
And then {VOC breath} acting coaches {VOC breath{
I don't know how (necessary) the coaches are - .. In education. Because drama teachers usually -
Are not - .. Acting coaches.
So.
I'd say let's cut funding for the acting coaches. Just for a little bit and see how things do. .. See if there's a complete fallout of society.
Uh.
We don't need to continue funding poetry books. .. Because they have poetry books.
Yeah, let's keep the special ed. .. And get rid of speech therapy.
Cooking classes
Uh. .. Just - .. Turn on food network.
That is pretty different and -
Yeah. .. It's pretty necessary for access.
Eh.
Let's go ahead and {QUAL lengthened} axe those. .. No more sugar free juice machines.
We could lump that in together with the math tutors and - .. keep one or the other.
Yeah.
Em.
I know so many music teachers. I don't wanna cut them. {VOC laugh}
And it's important.
Mm-kay. So how many have we cut from this one?
Speech therapy.
Acting coaches, poetry books.
The cooking classes - .. And the sugar free juice machines.
We'll see.
Reproductive education. That's staying.
Um.
I guess they're kinda similar.
Well the sex ed is under education while the reproductive education is under public health.
And that could be - also be more along the lines of like prenatal.
K- Or not necessarily prenatal. Checkups which was on there - .. but just -
Okay. Yes. This is what you need to be doing for your baby's health and all that. So.
Mm. .. We definitely don't want an unemployed populous so.
Yeah,
Invasive species removal.
But I don't think we're necessarily cutting these things forever until the end of time. .. We could probably - .. Do a trial cut for a year. .. {VOC laugh}
It is important.
I don't think we (can) cross the streams, no.
{VOC laugh} I'm so glad you got that reference {VOC breath} Okay. Uh. Toxic waste disposal.
We don't want to be - .. wallowing in our own toxic waste.
Um. Hospital additions.
What are we adding?
I ne- I know that mine really needs a new operating suite but -
Yeah {VOC laugh} Who c- {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} Who cares about the bagel factories.
Bagel factory inspections, they can go off for a little while. .. Hospital additions. .. Ehm.
They don't need public funding, really. .. So we don't (really need) do public funding for hospital additions so we can cut that.
Probably not because I know that needle exchange also includes uh diabetes equipment for homeless and so on and so forth.
Um.
(Moon of) .. Yeah.
Yeah. It's broken. We need to come up with something else for it.
Yeah.
Keep it.
Egg farm regulations.
They're pretty well regulated at this point.
So we can cut that.
Let's get rid of weed control. Invasive species removal is more overarching.
Totally. .. Well -
Um.
I mean the prenatal check ups are pretty important.
That would be unpleasant to the microphone.
Um. .. Let's see.
Uh. Gosh.
If we were to cut one then the duties that its cut will fall under the other
And prenatal checkups are a larger -
Financial thing so we - we should probably keep that.
And then -
That way -
The funding from e- reproductive education that isn't completely cut will be funneled into that.
{VOC start} There's like no funding that really needs to go to that.
And for the most part people don't know their neighbors anymore anyway.
Okay. So how many do we have from there?
Reproductive education.
Uh invasive sp- no it was the -
Hospital additions. Bagel factory.
Sex offender
Egg farm.
Weed control. Yay!
We got - .. Oh. And we got rid of - .. neighborhood watch so there's seven.
We can keep one.
Um.
Then let's keep the reproductive education.
Alright.
Excellent. Moving right along.
I don't wanna have a whole bunch of cats. {VOC breath}
Mm-hm.
And then it cost money - It cost more money to put em down than to spay them.
Public news station is important. Oh no!
Oh no! {VOC laugh}
Nobody watches it.
Yeah.
We can come back to it.
Food bank we're keeping.
Yeah. Junior soccer league.
I mean the Y_M_C_A_ has their own and - .. We don't need a county one.
Uh. Kitten and puppy adoption.
I don't know why we have to have that publicly funded.
Yes. And no more kitten and puppy adoption
Let's keep the soup kitchens.
Let's keep the housing assistance.
Mm we're not really doing anything with them. Just catching em and putting em in pound
That -
Seems rather ridiculous.
I'd say we get rid of the dog catcher.
Or lump it under (??) pest control. There we go.
Yeah. No more boys basketball club.
The public access station {QUAL lengthened} we can {QUAL lenghtened} (we) kind of -
Combine that with the public news station.
So we can get rid of one or the other.
Yeah.
Mm-kay. .. Reusable bag campaign.
Uh {VOC breath} Do we really need to campaign over it anymore?
People are doing well and for the most part their keeping their plastic bags anyway. And -
Well - {VOC mouthnoise} I'm gonna assume that we're - .. in the perfect society that has now adopted the reusable bag campaign.
And we don't need to campaign over it anymore.
Veterinary hospital.
I'd like to keep it but at the same time - .. publicly funded -
Yeah. Football stadium upkeep.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So we've - we're getting rid of the public news station -
The junior soccer league -
Adoption -
Dog catcher -
Basketball -
Reusable bag campaign.
So we can keep the -
No, let's keep the veterinary hospital.
Nn-yeah.
Let's go ahead and keep the adoption.
Because I really don't care about that football stadium. {VOC breath}
It's not bringing {VOC start} in any money and -
Exactly.
Alright.
Okay.
Infrastructure and licensing.
Oh god keep the teaching certificates.
Everyone speeds anyway and don't we already have them up there? Are they pai- {VOC start} do we have to pay rent for having them? .. {VOC laugh}
I mean, people aren't stealing them, are they? {VOC breath}
So we'll get rid of the speed limit signs.
Yeah. So let's just keep - .. {VOC start} Let's get rid of the additional bus stops.
Yeah let's keep licensing them.
Yeah we'll keep the licenses. So we'll also keep the boating license.
Yes let {VOC start} .. Pothole maintenance is necessary.
Subway system. {VOC breath}
Kind of - .. It's a subway for like a mile and a half. {VOC laugh}
Yeah. That's true.
Yeah we need to keep funding it until it's done. Because a half done one isn't gonna do anything.
So we'll keep the subway system for now.
Hunting tags. {VOC breath}
I mean every time someone gets a license they are paying for it.
So that's a source of income. .. So let's keep that.
Towing services should be privatized.
So -
Yeah. So no more towing services.
Um. Massage certificate. .. That's another certification.
How many flag poles -
Do we have in this city that we need to have a flag pole repair department?
How many people are we putting out of a job if we cut that? Like one {VOC laugh} His name is Larry and he works part time. I think w- it's okay if we get rid of the flag pole repair.
I have never heard of a taxi stop.
I'm standing outside the grocery store. I'm gonna call a taxi.
Let's get rid of the taxi stops.
Or at least stop funding them.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes and no more taxi stops.
Go ahead and keep that.
Yes. We'll keep public bus upkeep.
Yes they are. We did not c- cut a whole lot here.
Additional bus stops.
Towing services, flag pole repair, taxi stops -
Need one more.
Hm {VOC breath}
Yeah.
There isn't much hunting in the count- this particular county.
But if you go hunting anywhere do you need a -
License from that county.
Does it have to be where you live? Or does it have to be from where you're going?
Okay. Well let's get rid of hunting tags.
Alright.
Yeah. Six from each one.
Um. Sorry Larry.
But you can - .. Start your own private business repairing flag poles.
Alright.
We're done {VOC breath}
Flag pole repair. I mean really {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Alright. Here we go. {VOC laugh} Which category do you wanna start at?
Sounds good. Alright, education programs. Math tutors, how important are those?
I agree. .. Um, they -
There may - .. Uh, yeah, they're - they're important. It depends on like what kind of math obviously. .. Um but if - if - if I think it's like - .. Everyday stuff like um -
Important things like taxes or uh stuff like that then math - math tutors can be very, very handy.
We already have normal cooks, don't we?
Um. So the assistant cooks maybe cut those guys. Um.
No. No. .. Dear God no. No. That a - yeah. .. That is - .. needed everybody.
Custo- yeah gotta keep stuff clean. .. Um. Speech therapy.
I really like it. And it's a good idea. .. Um. Let's see what else we have uh before we do that.
(It's) football equipment.
They could (deal) with a little less.
Maybe. .. I'm not a big fan personally but I can't let like personal {VOC start} opinions gets in the way.
True. That's very true.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe - .. cut - .. (4x)
Yeah. See - see how things go. Maybe next year we can vote on it {VOC laugh}
Sounds good. Poetry books?
I don't think so. There's - there's enough.
There's enough. .. Yeah.
Um. Special ed teachers. Speech therapy could fall under that. So we could keep the special ed teachers and get rid of speech therapy.
Alright.
Um.
Yeah, yeah. Not - not too bad.
Um. Note takers, disability services um those co- .. Maybe fall under special ed teachers.
Um, although it's {VOC start} (it's) pretty different.
Yeah.
It's - .. Pretty necessary - .. For those people.
Just as a side note, I actually did that my freshman year.
I took - took notes for the disability services people.
Okay. Um. Sugar free juice machines.
Eh. .. It's - I - I don't care. .. Yeah. .. Not un-
Bookkeeping classes.
Um.
Eh. I don't think we need to keep funding that.
Um. It's not -
Too hard to learn.
Maybe. I dunno.
True. True. Let's keep math tutors.
I think that's a little better. .. Music teachers.
Yeah. .. I know {VOC breath}
Yeah.
I think we can keep that.
So assistant cooks. {VOC breath} Um. Speech therapy.
Acting coaches, poetry books.
Cooking classes. (I thought you said someone) .. Sugar k- - Six.
Can we manage to get rid of six from every single thing else?
{VOC breath} Alright. {VOC breath} Sounds good. So.
It could fall under sex ed.
Or -
Cause I mean they're - .. Pretty similar.
Sex ed could -
True.
True.
True. Yeah. .. Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah. Reproductive education. Yeah. That - that - yeah that should work for that.
Job training programs.
Yeah.
So I think keep that. Keep the vaccinations.
Um. Invasive species removal.
Not *as important. Um. It's still - .. It's still a big issue. Um.
Yeah.
These are all the drastic trial cuts. Alright.
I - I think it's important.
Um it could -
Uh {VOC breath}. I dunno if we can like cross things between categories.
Okay {VOC laugh}
Yeah it's {QUAL breathy}
No. No.
We already are over at Hanford.
Um.
Pfft. This is tough.
Um.
They're already pretty good.
Um. .. Hm.
True.
Could screw bagel factory inspections. {VOC laugh}
Uh.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Do you think needle exchange could fall under S_T_D_ education? Potentially?
I'm not sure about that one.
Oh.
Makes sense.
Yeah.
Sex offender database. .. I think personally it's pretty broken because people who just like - .. Drunkenly pee in public or moon somebody they get put on there, ruined for the rest of their lives. I think it's pretty broken.
Um.
Yeah so. Cut that for now, come up with something else later.
Veterans medical assistance. .. Keep it. Yep. Yep. Yep.
Eh.
They are. They're good enough.
Um. We - we can - .. keep either weed control or invasive species removal. They're pretty much - .. They're -
Yeah.
It's a little more important. Yeah. Prenatal checkups could fall un- fall under reproductive education cuz like you - er.
Which one were you talking about for that?
Oh, yeah, they're definitely important.
Um.
It's just a matter of - oh, I can feel a sneeze coming.
Okay. I think I'm good.
Oh yeah. {VOC laugh{
Listening to random thing, oh hey there's a sneeze. Okay, okay. Continuing. Uh. Prenatal checkups.
Yeah.
Reproductive education.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay. Sounds good.
Um. Neighborhood watch support.
No. {QUAL lengthenend} I think people are good enough on their own.
Exactly.
Sokay. So that was - .. an -
Yes.
No, keeping that. Um.
Did you just say hospital additions?
Bagel factory.
Um. Sex offender. Egg - or - .. Egg farm and weed control.
Perfect!
Six.
Okay. So that means we can keep one.
And if we - if we wanna keep with that.
Yes. Yes. That's a good idea.
Perfect. .. Awesome.
Okay {QUAL breathy} Recreation and public services. Um, stray cat spaying.
And it's so sad when they all have to get put down. I'm such a cat person, I can't do that. .. {VOC laugh}
It's - yeah exactly. Than it does to spay them. .. Okay, keeping that. Um.
{VOC start} {VOC laugh} Scre- Screen went dark. {VOC breath} Okay. Um, public news station.
I think it's good but - .. Honestly -
Personally I get all my news from the internet.
Um.
That being said there are still a ton of people who watch it. Um.
I dunno.
Yeah we come back to that. Food bank. .. Yes. Um. Junior soccer league. They can play on their own.
{VOC breath} I know. It's - that's fine.
Yeah.
If the spaying does good - as - as much as it does -
Um.
Then that won't have to be as much of a -
No.
There's plenty of people -
Who would do that on their own. Out of their own good will.
Okay.
Yes. .. Um. Housing - yes.
Um. Dog catcher - .. can -
Uh.
I dunno. Cuz we have something for cats. Stray cat spaying.
(Only) that like encompass dogs too.
(It's) true.
{VOC laugh} .. Yeah.
Okay. .. Um. Or maybe lump it under pest control?
Alright. Boys basketball club. Same thing with the junior soccer league.
Um .. Public access sta- Is that like -
That's kinda what I was thinking.
Yeah. Pub- public access station's like - um - like P_B_S, right?
Okay. .. So tha- yeah those can be - those can be merged.
It's pretty -
It's - I know. People are doing pretty good.
Yeah.
At least - at least now, in here, if we're doing that.
Yeah. Yeah. Me too.
{VOC breath} Sounds good. Um. I'd - .. I'd like to keep that.
True.
Yeah.
I mean, we have the stray cat spaying.
Um.
Let's - .. {VOC start} I'd - we've already like cut a few so let's go ahead and just see what we have. Um, football stadium upkeep.
Isn't that already private anyways?
Screw that.
Okay. Yeah, no. And {VOC start} then keep pest control.
Okay. So -
Yes. Um, junior soccer league.
Adoption. .. Um. Dog catcher. Basketball.
Um. Reusable bag.
Oh, okay. So we can keep (vets). Um.
And maybe, um.
{VOC start} Um. Maybe keep the public access {PRN asseks} ac- ugh - access in favor of the football?
Or keep one of the other things in favor of the football stadium upkeep.
Like maybe - maybe adoption or something like that.
Okay. .. And so -
No. No. I don't either.
And (3x) all the money that's bringing in goes straight to the other peoples' pockets. So (there's) not public so screw that. Okay. Um. .. So I think that's - I think that's good. So get rid of public news, lump that into - .. public access. Um.
Uh, so public news, junior soccer.
Dog catcher, boys basketball.
Reusable bag and football.
Cool. Sounds good. Those are the six. {VOC breath} Last but not least, infrastructure and licensing.
Yes please. Yes please. Um. Speed limit signs.
Everybody speeds anyways.
Those - yeah those - .. {VOC laugh} Those things - yeah. Those - those are already up there.
I hope not. That - that'd be a little crazy. Um.
I think - .. They're already planning on cutting the bus stops. I really don't want them to - um -
We don't need additional ones. We just need the ones that we already have. To keep them.
Um.
Yeah. So keep what we have. Um. Tattoo artist licenses it's .. definitely a good idea to keep them licensed.
Keep licensing most things. So like boating -
Yeah. Pothole maintenance. .. Oh God, yes please. I - I hate potholes. .. Unless there's - unless there's something we can lump it under.
Um. .. (I) kinda already have that and it's already -
Hm.
Well, I mean -
The sound - the like - the link light rail is already kind of a subway.
Like it's - it's - it's -it's -
Yeah. It's - it's - .. like being built right now underneath Capitol Hill and the U_ District.
Um. So I mean it's already there. It's already getting funded. Um.
Eh.
Well we need to keep it until it's done.
No.
Keep that for now {PRN thaow}. Um.
Uh.
I dunno.
Yeah.
Yes.
Um.
Yes. {VOC start} It mostly already is anyways.
Okay.
Yeah. Don't want random people touching you.
Like two, maybe. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
Yeah.
I think we should get rid of taxi stops. Um. Because - .. No.
Yeah. It's stupid. It's unnecessary.
Yeah. I mean ther- they're -
They're getting run out by like all these ride share programs anyway. Which are so much better because taxis are creepy. .. And they're expensive as hell.
And they're - .. just annoying. .. Okay. So no more taxis. Fishing licenses go ahead and keep.
Public bus upkeep. I - I can keep that.
Uh. Drainage ditches are good for flooding.
Um.
Okay. Yeah {VOC start} let's see what we (oh so) speed limits. Um. .. Additional bus stops.
Um.
Uh. .. Towing.
Um. Flag pole. Taxi stops.
One more.
So -
Hm.
What do you think? I'm thinking maybe either -
Like - .. Hunting or fishing. I dunno.
So th- this is just county.
So there's not much hunting in the county.
Like there's plenty in eastern Washington.
Not - It depends on like what you're hunting. .. It -
I'm pretty sure it's where you're going.
Um. And - .. Yeah. Those are state funded anyways, not county.
At least - pretty much. I think my dad's - my dad has done stuff like that. So -
Okay. So. I think those are our six.
Sounds good. I think that's six from each - each category.
Dang.
Sorry Larry. Yeah.
{VOC start} Or you can just like start something else cuz there'll be plenty of funding in everything else.
Awesome. .. Very good. .. Done.
Paradise
Like really {VOC laugh}
{VOC laugh} Now we can be as obnoxious as those lists were. Or not.
Tow ropes.
Mm. .. Well this is - actually that's pretty good.
Food.
I think. Travel guides (??) {QUAL whispered.
Oh. Do you wanna do that? Oh that's a good idea.
And we used to like playing game- You know, where you can only like -
One at a time (but) we don't have that uh -
Oh.
Backpacks.
S- packages of cookies.
Flags.
Uh.
Liters of water.
Mm. That look? Drinks.
I dunno {QUAL whispered}
Do you have? Uh -
But ye- yeah. But you had like - yeah.
(1x) cups. When did - I saw -
All paper bags. Yeah.
Books of matches. (1x) pre-cut wood.
Canvas bags.
Is there a backpack somewhere?
Fish hooks. {VOC start} Yes! Fish hooks. (??) {QUAL whispered}
Bags of peat moss.
I'm n- {VOC laugh} We may have a few of those like okay that just in -
Flags.
Oka- .. Oh, that's - small saw. There we go.
Pre-cut wood. Matches.
Ah, small axes. We -
Mm-hm. And knives too, box knives.
Look -
Oh. See - the- that's very - I think that's a - yeah - just {VOC start} and what's so interesting is the gender thing. {VOC breath} How tweezers {VOC start} you see as a small tool, I'm like -
I'm li- no i- it's a toiletry thing, it's for plucking your eyebrows. Isn't that funny? {VOC laugh}
Mm. Yeah. Box knives. I would think.
(Tee) and half inch tubing - .. and duct tape - .. I would think like heavy cable -
Yeah and peat - .. moss is sort of -
I - this seems like a total outlier. And flags. (I'm) just as general hardware, right?
D- yeah. Yeah.
Electric heater. You need that to heat up after your wetsuit. Paper bags and large - or there - are there other like - um -
Or just carrying. Ye- household.
Well canvas bags -
So it's kinda like in this little - loose leaf paper, maybe books.
Oh. Cook stove. That goes - .. (see this is like) camping stuff, right? Camping-ish
Okay.
Okay.
Ah, yeah. Backpack there.
Mm-hm.
Either one. Camping.
They're in our camping thing.
But - but -
Empty plastic jugs for camping? Car camping. {VOC laugh} Uh - un - er - fishing I guess. If you go -
When - {QUAL laughing}
Yeah.
Cushions for deck chairs.
Uh. .. It's kinda this whole sort of - I think - you think? Mm-kay.
Oh. And the five pound weights. (Where'd ye) gonna work out? {VOC breath} Yeah. That's -
Nn-yeah.
Okay.
What about food - .. stuff?
Yeah.
And this is all - .. like - .. clothing stuff, yeah? Okay.
{VOC start} Yeah. Mm-hm.
{VOC breath} {VOC start} Ingredients versus or - or ingredients versus already made. .. Yeah.
Either - .. {VOC start} .. uh.
Yeah. And I just wanted to check and make sure that - yes. This is good so we still have all the -
{VOC start} (Uh-huh).
Sugar, ice cream, cake mix, and eggs.
Okay.
Sugar's obvious- like a main staple.
Um.
That is - it's a weird thing.
Sticks of butter.
See I immediately go to, okay what does it take to m-
{VOC start} The thing is - is you have cake mix.
I would have the su- You don't need to put sugar in cake mix, right? Cuz it's already in there.
So I would look {VOC start} So - cu- right here there's - this looks like baking stuff to me. But I normally would have sugar in the baking stuff but I'm not allowed to.
I would think so.
Oh. We'll just do that. .. But here - here -
Oh. It's the aisle, right? So -
Is this?
{VOC breath} No. That's - that's like - is this walking down the aisle and down the left you have the sugar and on the right you have ice cream?
Yeah - but then eggs and butter are by each other in the store.
Maybe it should be down here.
Okay.
Do you want all the food first? The easy (2x) seems like - easiest -
Okay. Mm.
Yeah. .. I'm going to have - oops - .. ice cream.
Don- .. yeah.
Like that?
Like -
You'd have doughnuts on one side of the aisle and cookies on the other. This is my virgo. Or would they be all like -
Over here.
Cuz that's - that's (an a) -
That's gonna be in the -
{VOC laugh} This is just think - my brain {QUAL laughing} .. this is - .. in a f- I know! This is in a freezer!
We don't have to be -
I think we should put the whisky next to the - .. ice cream. {VOC laugh}
Yes! Yes. Is it?
Really?
Ah.
Whisky and ice cream.
Okay.
Uh.
And then -
Well let's just - okay, so we've got  -
That's like a -
Um.
A b- What do I call it?
A s- Yeah. Thank you. An ingredient as opposed to something that's already -
As a processed item. But still.
It doesn't really matter. {QUAL whispered}
Yeah.
Mm-kay.
Do these things just - ?
Go down here then.
Peas and soy beans.
Yay.
And -
Figs. {VOC laugh}
They can just - {QUAL whispered}
There's something else that should be there. {VOC laugh} Nother legume that we don't have.
Well like - .. Oh wait. You were saying whisky and the ice cream, right? {QUAL laughing}
We can make this {VOC start} store however we want it, right?
Oh God. Yeah. {QUAL laughing} That would be - .. there.
Looks nice, see. {VOC laugh}
Can't help it.
I have - {QUAL whispered}
Even - {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} You can go ahead and rearrange that all if you choose. {VOC laugh}
{VOC breath} Hey.
An actual -
And a travel guide sec- boating supplies - .. {VOC mouthnoise}
Yeah.
Yep. I think so.
Kay.
And small saws in case you wanna sink your boat. Cuz you can -
Fishing net, fish {PRN fif} hooks, and wetsuits.
Kay.
Power cords.
Mm.
I think so.
See - um - I think -
I mean - .. I would think all this stuff could just go down -
Here. {VOC laugh} You know. {QUAL laughing}
Siding, mouse traps, power cords, and {VOC mouthnoise}.
What do you think?
Sure. Yeah. Kinda small -
Small -
Things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. .. {VOC laugh}
D- do you think?
All the stuff's just kinda all - it's just the - yeah - Oh. A tow rope though. That's - that's boating.
Yeah.
But like power cord and heavy cable -
Roles of duct tape.
Half inch tubing. {QUAL whispered}
I think the five pound weights should go - Oh wait. Electric heater.
(guess) the power cords.
Then -
Of course you need your five pound weights between your scissors and your duct tape.
Half inch tubing, bags of peat moss.
Buckets.
With the - yeah.
Okay.
{VOC breath} It is.
Toys, refrigerator magnets, toilet paper, ah-ha. That's kind of - that's either a paper good or a toiletry but I think - yeah.
Yeah.
Hm.
I think since we got a lotta clothes - .. we may need to put the clothes - .. in between the toys and the pet food. {VOC laugh}
I don't see anything wrong with that.
It's our {VOC laugh} It's our store {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} We (could) put the whisky by the -
Pet food.
{VOC laugh} Yeah. Refrigerator magnets. {VOC laugh}
Most - I act - and just thinking of the store. T_N_C_ .. In Bainbridge - .. you know, you've got the pet food -
And kinda like - .. the cups and the paper bags and stuff on one - you think?
And canvas bag. .. {VOC laugh} Think? {VOC laugh}
If it works for the (Nakatas), yes. .. {VOC breath}
Okay.
{VOC breath} Yeah. {VOC breath} I'd s- like yeah.
I - .. s- I'd see - we could have clothes here. And then the rest of the -
Other bundles of s- .. ticks and wood
Travel guides, mouse sh- kinda here? Or?
K-
Backpack could go over there, yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe the empty plastic jugs and the buckets by the - .. {VOC breath} Well these are - .. I'm think - yeah I was like - is this - are these the like -
Welcome to Seattle magnets or - .. you know the - .. industrial -
No frills ones.
Cuz then we could put the -
{VOC mouthnoise} Empty plastic jugs and buckets by em maybe.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
You think those two by the -
Small axes, small saws.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.
(Oh) Socks and shoe laces and boots.
Hat and backpack maybe?
Large sweaters - .. I mean large vests and thick sweaters and light jackets.
And - ah, heavy coats.
Oh, I don't know which one {QUAL whispered} {VOC laugh} This goes on someone's back.
Hm.
Looks good?
Alright.
Put tha- the -
Oh. That's a great idea.
Hats, thick sweaters. {QUAL whispered}
Large vests, heavy coats.
(Wait) heavy coat then thick sweater.
And large vests and -
Oh. Very good.
Oh ri- ight.
I s- bucket next to plastic jug and siding or -
Here. Looks like pfft yeah.
{VOC breath} Or we could have buckets for those people who need to bail out their {QUAL laughing} sinking -
Boats.
And then um -
(Up) just keep going? Yeah. Okay. .. So we have socks.
Shoe laces and then boots.
Oh. Look at that.
Are we pleased with our - ?
{VOC breath} I'm good with it.
I think it's a mighty fine - I mean for what we had to start with, right? W- I mean I would never have put the mouse traps there. {VOC laugh} I'm just {QUAL laughing}
Couldn't yeah (like) - hm.
Wonder if the butter and the eggs though should go by the sugar. {VOC laugh}
{VOC breath} We can call it done.
Oh! We didn't do the eggs. Ah. Okay. Good point. Mm-hm.
So it works.
Did we move those? Or were those there?
Do you remember?
Okay.
Oh I did. {VOC breath} Yeah. Cuz I was like it doesn't fit {QUAL lengthened} with -
Kay.
{VOC breath} You are bad. {PRN ba-ha-had} Go down there.
Off the side.
Okay. Are we done?
Are you comfortable with this - ?
Layout of our store.
{VOC breath} Boy (it) could use some colors this is really -
Okay.
Okay.
I'm good too. We're done.
So -
Yeah. At least they have all the food stuffs in one.
Would it be helpful to spread everything out on the table?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
There are oatmeals and pouches.
And they have gas powered s- cook stoves.
So -
Hm.
Books. {QUAL whispered}
{VOC breath} I don't have a particular -
Or - it's just kinda a loose grouping of like {QUAL laughing} .. well these seem to go together.
Then that should go with those, right?
These should go together.
Mm-hm.
So -
Maybe we could like -
Look at -
Outliers or something.
These seem to got well.
Hm.
Box knives. .. I'd put them more with like - .. small utens- small tools like -
Tweezers and - those are -
But those go with -
Cuz scissors, right?
Uh-huh.
Yeah. Well I'm thinking that's no (sh- could) also go with 'face {PRN frace} - face cream though.
Yeah.
How bout scissors? Those go with -
Yeah. Those are just weird.
Tow rope-y things.
Mm-hm.
Yeah. Or - .. what do you do with wetsuits? I suppose they could go with fish hooks. {VOC laugh}
Baking supplies? Or house hold supplies?
Uh -
Yeah. Those seem to go well.
Camping-ish. Yeah.
Electric heaters. Yeah.
Mm-kay. So if we're doing kind of a camping-ish thing then backpacks should go in here.
Matches. I'm not sure if those should go with -
Household supplies or -
Okay.
Yeah. Sure.
You're right.
{VOC breath} I don't know. We can put those down kind of in the weird stuff that need a -
(And these are) .. books and loose leaf. Yeah.
Much better.
Mm.
That all seems like a logical grouping to me, right?
And then - .. would - .. these kinda things be - ?
More -
Together like - .. sweet things -
Mm-hm.
These are all -
Beverages, right?
Oh, yeah, that's right. We have to contend with that too.
Mm-hm.
That's a weird thing. {QUAL whispered}
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
{VOC laugh} Would sticks of butter then go with the sugar?
Alright. Let's put it there.
I th- {QUAL lengthened}
An - naw. I think it goes on that.
That -
On - no. No
Oh.
I'm not sure.
This is true.
Okay. Let's do that.
An -
Seems like the -
Be the easiest thing, right? These would seem to go with ice cream, right? With all the sweets together.
And chocolate.
Well that would be frozen, right? {VOC laugh}
Mm-hm.
Eh that makes sense to me. Cuz - .. whiskey with (smooth vanilla) ice cream and it is lovely.
Oh yeah.
But -
Mm-hm.
An ingredient? {VOC laugh}
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
(You know) these seem to be good together cuz they're - .. they're -
You know, they're breakfast-y
Probably. Yeah.
Legumes.
Juice, water, whisky.
'That's{PRN s} right.
Ranging everything alphabetically.
{VOC breath} What would seem {PRN seev} that. .. So we have a boating supply up there.
That -
That seems {QUAL lengthed} that these kinds of things would go with them, right?
Alright.
Mm-hm. {VOC laugh}
Yeah. Seems right.
And maybe loose leaf paper and 'books {PRN boo-..ks} up by the travel guides?
Okay.
Yeah. Cuz these all kinda would group around mouse traps, right?
Unless we go over here and put that with.
(That a bit better?)
Alright.
Oh yeah. All that's just kind of weird - .. things.
Is it? Oh yeah.
Yeah. Makes sense.
Let's put that up over here.
Camp supply stuff.
This store's heavy into camping.
Yeah.
All through here, yeah?
Mm.
The whisky goes by toys, right?
Mm-hm.
Okay. .. I can -
They - they go with that.
If it works for the (Nakatas) then -
Huh.
Mm-hm,
Well let's see if we can split this group up into something smaller then.
Like - .. {NVC} this could go with it, right?
These are more tools.
These are burnable things.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
I think it's probably ease- yeah it's probably easier to split these guys up into then other stuff.
They might work with -
Like in here?
And then -
Wood product with them?
Okay.
That makes these guys kinda weirdos -
Now. Which can go in here.
{VOC breath} And then - {VOC breath}
Let's put some order to these.
Mm-hm.
That looks good.
Yeah.
Here. We can do a transition with backpacks and toys.
Matches. .. {VOC start} {VOC start} Buckets.
Damn you buckets! {PRN stage whisper}
Here.
Let's move that up.
Oops. Can't touch the mouse traps.
Okay.
Yeah.
(Those) go underneath the -
Yeah. I thin so.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Mm. .. Yeah I guess so.
Can't - .. do that though because the - .. eggs are stuck.
Yeah.
They're fixed.
Oh of the - the dried figs we just kind of like eh. .. You don't belong with anyone.
I think we put those there.
Mm-hm.
No I'm - I'm a - I agree. Dried figs should be ostracized. {VOC laugh}
If they were raisins they should be just completely left alone.
Yeah.
Uh. I -
Mm-hm. {VOC laugh}
Yeah. I guess so.
We could start off with just picking some - .. random number. And then -
Or we could be more -
Appropriate and look through and see.
I was thinking five.
It's sorta in between ta- okay.
Okay. Mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Nope. That's -
That's and easy one for me too. .. Okay. So that's one.
Mm.
Can.
But - .. we don't - .. have to - .. discuss that too much. Cuz I agree with you. Bu- act- no - {VOC start} like that's - I'm -
I'm a social worker for goodness sakes {QUAL laughing} so this is - Not that I - I mean {VOC start} I do like football too. Except -
Well. Oh god, here we go.
Um. .. Depends on what it is. If we say okay the football equipment is just to upgrade the stuff they already have and the stuff is pretty darn good.
Then again, if it's these brand new helmets for - you know - to supposedly minimize the um -
The um - yeah - uh -
Concussion.
Issue.
Bookkeeping. {QUAL whispered}
I think - {VOC start} I mean I'd {VOC start} If we have to cut stuff. And to me I think assistant cooks -
Unfortunately. I mean I know that's a job for those people. (I mean) but some of (this) is jobs for everybody (and we just) -
I think so.
Poetry books. {QUAL whispered} (??) {VOC laugh} Exactly. {QUAL whispered}
So.
Let's see bookkeeping. Music. (??) {QUAL whispered}
Let's me- .. Let's see {VOC start} The most important for me I guess would be sex ed. Keep it.
Math tutor.
Um.
Of course I'll (2x) speech therapy.
I mean acting coach I could see if it comes - you know if we don't - I could see that - .. necess- that kinda going away. I mean if you have a drama -
The - the you know. Anyway. That c- that could go uh -
It's a lesser than a - {VOC start} er - special ed teacher and uh - .. I think note takers for disability services are very important. {VOC mouthnoise} And music teachers I think are important {QUAL whispered}
So then assistant cooks. .. {VOC start} Assistant cooks.
Uh. Football equipment.
{VOC cough} Pardon me. Juice.
Bookkeeping. That's four. {VOC cough} And then - .. acting coaches. That would be my five I guess.
Sorry. I'm not a fan of poetry but I don't wanna take poetry away from the child that might be {VOC laugh} interested in it. Assuming it's for children.
So.
It's an important. Yeah.
Okay
Oh, here we go. Yes. {VOC breath}
I know. .. I know. {VOC breath}
Yes.
I know {QUAl laughing} - It's like I should - .. Five. Why did I do that!?
Why did we choose five!? {NVC} .. Okay but - .. Let's see.
Yes. Bagels gone.
{VOC start} {VOC start} It's low on the -
Mm-kay. Um {QUAL lengthened}
One would hope.
But -
It's sorta like if people already have -
Are {VOC breath} They are - they are different. But. Okay.
A budget that's - Yeah. Weed control and, unfortunately, invasive species removal.
I would - .. Think um -
That's true. Or they could focus on those -
Those invasive weeds.
Okay.
(2x) Bagel factory {QUAl whisper}
{VOC breath} I know. Um.
Hospital additions. Did we talk about that?
Oh h- how bout we just put it in.
{VOC laugh} The usual terms of all the hospitals. At least here at the U_ dub and {VOC breath} They just - you know - .. They can get money from the Gates foundation or somebody else. Who cares about the bi- Not that they don't care but -
We'll just say that.
Yeah. Not around here. Maybe in the south. {VOC laugh}
Bagels.
Um.
(??) Weed control. That's four. {QUAL whispered}
Um.
{VOC breath} Well. I'm sorry but I would go to invasive species next. Because I mean plants are important but people are more important {QUAL laughing} I mean I - uh - so -
But then I'm concerned about the egg farm regulations because of - .. so many people eat eggs and if we're talking about salmonella and stuff.
If um -
Yes. Okay. That's five. That's good.
{VOC laugh} There's {VOC breath} .. Pass the buck.
Mm-kay.
Yep.
Works for me for -
Mm-kay.
Alright.
I think I know one we might agree on at first but -
{VOC start} Could that be the second from the bottom? .. Or were you thinking something else?
{VOC laugh} I was thinking football stadium upkeep. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} {VOC laugh} We don't have poor people. {QUAL laughing}
Um.
So public access is like -
P_B_S_, right?
P- Public news is like N_P_R_? I mean, just what's the difference between public access and public news?
Oh.
{VOC laugh} Scary.
I don't think we need that.
Okay.
And there's national
Stations. But that - then again that would be like - .. that's like getting rid of K_U_O_W_ right? Yeah. {VOC breath} Mm-kay.
Football stadium {QUAL whispered}
Yeah.
Oh, not puppies though.
But yeah, the -
And it doesn't actually because people are so -
Irresponsible with their animals that - .. And or they -
Especially on your side of the mountains.
I ain't gonna do that to my dog {VOC laugh}
{VOC laugh} Food bank is important.
Okay {VOC laugh}
Yep. Then there's boy's basketball club. But that's just boys. Junior soccer league is for - .. both.
I would think.
(Veterinary hospital) {QUAL whispered}
I mean it sound - there's this theme here - I mean {VOC start} of - I mean you've got stray cat spaying, kitten and puppy adoption, dog catcher, and veterinary hospital. And it's like whoa are they having a serious issue with - or they just want to like -
So let's just - let's just hypothesize that there's a fine -
Animal hospital {VOC laugh} And {VOC start} So I would say let's not expand. I mean (that) and that's a huge chuck of change - uh capital. F- Yeah.
Yeah.
Football stadiums that (can)
I - {VOC start} {VOC breath} Yeah.
Well, almost.
{VOC cough} I'm a - I'm a major animal advocate so I'm not so sure about that but - {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} But yes, when it comes down to this. .. But -
Um.
But I think - Do we have four? {VOC starts} Yeah. .. Say the vet hospital now.
Um.
A public -
Access station?
That's three.
And dog catcher maybe?
I - I'm a -
(That's all we need) two more. .. Oh. Um.
I mean - I guess if we have to - {VOC start} Between stray cat spaying and kitten and puppy adoption.
Oi.
Oh.
I guess - .. let's - we could - I mean {VOC start} That we could cut the kitten and puppy adoption. I - to me I would think that would be -
If you're like {PRN dike} trying to do a campaign.
Have them be adopted. There (we) go.
I think stray cat spaying's more important.
To keep the number of -
Okay.
Mm-kay.
Is that four {QUAL whispered} (??) Okay.
Um.
Did we talk about the reusable bag campaign?
{VOC breath} I know.
I guess to me on the - you know on Maslow's hierarchy - .. it's sort of like -
{VOC start} Because we live in this world and we are rich enough to talk about how we don't like plastic bags we can - .. {VOC start} not - we can do this so - {VOC breath} .. I um -
(I mean, as much as) - again I'm like - you know - the total green -
Wash out my Ziploc {QUAL whispered} bags and all that. If there's something we have to cut
I mean if we cut pest control that could be really bad for everybody. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} And you're right, I - I mean the boy's basketball club, the junior soccer league, those things are very important for kids.
To -
For public {QUAL laughing} health and safety. Even though - you know - in a way - keep kids interested in -
Okay.
(Yep.) Got our five there? Okay.
Oh boy. Now this.
Okay. {QUAL whispered}
Subway system. Okay. {QUAL whispered}
Mm.
Yeah.
Subway system. .. I mean {VOC breath} It all depends on what it is but that's -
I mean to me it's like you just {VOC start} I mean these - the numbers are so - you know - flag pole maintenance is probably what? Twenty thousand and a subway system is eighteen million. {VOC laugh} So - but - who knows? {VOC start} It just, that's an- totally expensive thing. Um.
I'm not saying keep it or leave it. It does seems a little on the -
Sorta frivolous but then so does tattoo artist li- but no it's not -
Licensing is important cuz you don't want -
All the tattoo artists not being licensed for obviously healthy reasons and things but -
Hm. Alright.
Taxi stops. What's that mean? Do you think?
Taxi stops. {QUAL whispered}
Okay.
They don't have any.
Flag pole repair is one that's easy.
Mm.
But aren't there private -? {PRN pribate}
Like triple A_ and private companies so (1x)
That do that.
{VOC breath} Yeah.
They did - mm-hm.
They just - private that goes and gets it - and they get - yeah.
Okay.
Mm.
I think we have enough speed limit signs.
{VOC cough} They don't light up and - .. change.
Let's do a happy -
Um.
Minimize the number of - .. hunting tags as - as  opposed to increase the number - .. I'm - cut it.
If it means eliminate - you know we're gonna have a little N_R_A_ issue I think. And {QUAL laughing} people but - .. uh.
I'm - hunting tags outta here -
For me. {VOC breath} {VOC laugh}
{VOC laugh} Yes. It's not moose season. {VOC laugh}
Um.
Okay. {NVC} Now.
My public bus upkeep has to be done to keep up the busses. {VOC laugh} That was very (??) {QUAL whispered} Um.
{VOC start} {VOC start} Taxis. Did we - .. do taxi stops? Cuz I still don't know if they are -
Un. .. Yeah.
Yeah. .. Yeah.
Mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
{VOC breath} Well what - and then just looking (at) - See when they say massage certificates it's sorta like what? (are we) Is the city in - or this - .. department in the business of training mass- mas- massage therapists to get certific- ? Cuz it says - as opposed to licensing but I'm assuming it's licensing. .. Or certifying. Same with so- then I - I think that's important. And keeping the teaching.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Pothole maintenance too. Oh {VOC breath}
{VOC laugh} Mm-hm.
So - .. Okay.
Okay.
Me too.
Score.
Done. .. We're done.
We're done.
Hm?
{VOC laugh} Oh that - {VOC laugh} Oops.
(Yeah.)
Alright. Five seems like a good -
Base number. .. Yeah. .. {VOC cough}
Education and programs. Math tutors, assistant cooks, sex ed, custodians. {VOC breath} Speech therapy, football equipment, acting coaches, poetry books, special ed teachers, cooking classes, note takers. {VOC breath} Sugar free juice machines, bookkeeping classes, and music teachers.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Yeah the sugar free book - .. sugar free juice machines don't really seem like a huge priority here.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Um.
I'm not a huge fan of football equipment. {QUAL laughing}
Although, I do also - {VOC start} recognize that it's -
The -
Way it works (within the system) to keep kids in - .. school. .. Mm.
Can.
Yeah.
Not yet.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
That'd be a good thing.
Mm.
(If they need a -)
Computerized blocking sled. Then I don't think they need that.
But it calculates the force vectors automatically.
Yeah. Bookkeeping classes probably could go. I don't think -
That's becoming pretty much automated now, right? {QUAL laughing}
Mm-mm.
Assistant cooks. Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Bu- Cooking classes.
Holistically are - .. more - .. important.
{VOC start} Cuz if you know how to cook then you don't have to go to McDonald's.
Mm-hm. {VOC cough}
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
It's a lesser thing than a teacher. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Juice.
The fr- sugar free juice.
The bookkeeping. Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
I think that's a good thing.
Public health and safety.
Reproductive ed, job training program, chicken pox vaccinations, invasive species removal, S_T_D_ education, toxic waste disposal. Goodness, it's gonna be hard to - .. do five. Except for those bagel factory inspections.
Hospital additions, needle exchange, sex offender database.
Vets (medical), egg farm, weed control, prenatal.
Neighborhood watch support.
Mm.
Yeah.
We can deal with dirty bagels.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
{VOC breath} Now, wouldn't reproductive ed and S_T_D_ ed go in the - hand and hand.
One would hope.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that weed control can go.
Especially if you're looking at -
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
{VOC breath} Or however if you - .. kept.
If you kept invasive species removal that takes care of most weeds.
Mm-hm.
Everything else seems pretty darn important.
No (I) haven't talked about hospital additions. I mean I think that that -
Mm-mm.
Yeah.
Yeah. The additions probably can -
Hold off. .. I - .. wouldn't think that most hospitals are working at full capacity ri- {VOC start} .. full holding capacity right now, right?
Yeah.
(So the) hospital additions, bagels -
And eggs.
And weed control. That's four.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yes. Totally
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
But that's a U_S_D_A_ thing. Push that off on the government.
That's not as local.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so.
Recreation and public services.
Yeah.
Yeah. Definitely we'd n-
Oh. I was thinking of housing assistance. Cuz - you know - in my - my district we don't have poor people (3x).
Yeah. Gone.
Gone.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Public access is more like the - that cable station.
That anybody can go on and do - it's what - it's what we did before Youtube.
Yeah.
I think that's - with Youtube it's pretty redundant.
Yeah.
No. But I think - I think that public - yeah. I think that public news stations are important just because of the - of the -
Um.
No. If we keep the stray cat spaying -
Then kitten and puppy adoption becomes a little less of a -
Issue. .. This is true
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm. .. {VOC laugh}
Food banks are important to keep.
Eh. Junior soccer league I'm a big fan of. {QUAL lengthened} Just because {QUAL lengthened}
Mm-yeah.
Okay. .. {VOC laugh}
Yeah.
Soup kitchen's definitely to keep. Housing assistance need to keep. But dog catcher - .. mm - .. yeah, I suppose.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
O-
A public - a public veterinary hospital is just like no.
No.
Priorities.
Humans above - .. pets any day.
Mm.
Yeah. {QUAL laughing}
Mm.
I don't remember. Football, -
Vet - veterinary {VOC start} veterinary hospital. Yeah.
What is it? The -
Public access station. Yes, three.
Mm-mm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Er.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay. They can go with that, totally.
It's four.
No we didn't. .. Um.
I think that -
That -
You know - I dunno.
It is -
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah that seems like a logical one to cut.
That could be really bad.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah. I think we got our five.
{VOC breath} Infrastructure and licensing. {VOC breath}
Teaching cert- speed limit signs.
{VOC start} Nobody listens to them anyhow.
Boating license, pothole maintenance, subway, hunting tags, tunneling.
Massage certificates. Flag pole repair,
Taxis.
Bus upkeep, drainage ditches.
Er.
Well - .. flag pole repair bye.
Seemed like a no brainer.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Places where the taxis get to hang out.
Yeah.
Towing services. Well I dunno. Breakdowns on the highway that's pretty important.
Yeah. That's true.
Mm that's all contracted out anyhow.
Like when D_O_T_ -
Flags someone for being - you know - parked for -
They - it's private.
Yeah. Okay. That's gone.
That can go.
Yeah. I can't -
That'd be awesome.
Yeah. {QUAL laughing} - Yeah. Let's get rid of the speed limits.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay. {QUAL laughing}
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm. {QUAL laughing}
I could go with that.
Yeah. .. Especially since we're -
Living in Seattle. There's not a whole lotta moose hunting going on {QUAL laughing} - .. here.
(That's) four.
Mm-hm.
Yeah. {VOC start} And we haven't really talked about em but taxi stops just don't seem like they would make a whole lot of - .. sense. You know -
One -
Taxis o- .. Are not listening to the laws {QUAL laughing} to begin with then they're being - {VOC breath} You know - pushed out by Uber and all these other folks. So -
Nn-yeah.
Yeah. I don't think that's so important. Like boating licenses, that's a source of income and -
You know - .. Tattoo artists {QUAL lengthend} I would certainly hope that they're licensed.
Mm-hm.
Maybe -
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Drainage ditches. Yeah, we live in high-rain area that'd be bad if they didn't work right.
Additional bus stops I'm always for.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think that's our five.
Yeah.
And end scene.
End scene.
Oh that's right, we cut the drama coaches so - {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
We can't. {QUAL laughing}
Well we're just looking for discussion points and looking at the smallest list.
Well maybe they're all the same number. I guess they are.
Fourteen.
Little more under infrastructure.
Well there's certain things that are - absolutely must be done.
Teaching certificates.
I'm over on the right.
Speed limit signs.
Public safety, don't you think?
Uh.
That's up for debate. Okay. We'll put a check next to that one.
Tattoo artist licenses. .. I think that's - .. pretty important. .. But it - .. oh.
We can't move em to another department can we?
But it is a license. It is a license.
Boating license.
Potholes are -
Infrastructure.
Towing stop - towing services are very important. You know people are -
Parked in the wrong place.
Massage certificates. .. I wonder what that means, certificates.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
The bus stops.
Yeah.
So we only got two on that one.
Although, massage certificates sounds to mean it doesn't say license.
Mm-hm.
And if we're looking at flag pole repair -
Pretty infrequent thing. But you never know, maybe not.
Alright. Let's see. So we have two for sure, maybe three under that one.
They all look good.
Now I believe in a public news station.
Public news station. That's a good thing.
Has to be the -
Well you gotta - I would s- I'd say you'd have to do at least two.
What would - what in the world is a public veterinary hospital?
It's under recreation and public services. The veterinary hospital. {VOC breath} Well I suppose if a -
Injured animals are found in the street or something.
Yeah.
How bout the stray cat spaying?
(ell)
Gotta -
Mm-hm.
I dunno.
We're looking for what doesn't fit.
I don't know. {QUAL whispered}
Alright. Dog catcher's definitely outta there.
People call -
They say there's a stray dog out here and along comes a truck and they pick em up and put em in a little place.
What's (a) difference between a public access station and a public news station?
I dunno.
Public access sta-
Oh! C_ span. Yeah. I love that.
Oh.
Dear. This is the one that's hard.
Yeah.
Okay. I'm still under public service - You take out the soup kitchen.
Because it's done by faith based groups.
They'll do it anyway.
And they're
Reusable bags.
Those are easy. .. Okay.
Public health and safety. Shou- you wanna go to education next?
Right.
Remove reproductive education.
We'll remove it. Yeah.
All over.
Yeah.
Okay. We'll leave reproductive.
Um. In under public health.
They're more talking about S_T_D_ but -
Weed control can go. .. Don't you think?
Well I'm having trouble with reproductive and sexually transmitted. One or the other.
And I say sexually transmitted. .. Because it should be under the other one.
I dunno.
No, it isn't.
But let's go with uh -
Reproductive education.
I don't know.
It's real important for public health though.
I'm - I'm just seeing a duplicate in s- uh - sexually transmitted diseases and reproductive education. Whoops.
Maybe we're not fast enough.
Uh.
They're sorta the same.
Okay. Sexually transmitted disease education. .. Gone. .. Although under public health you know what they do.
They give tests to people. {VOC breath} And if they come up positive for something there's a whole army of these little - .. public health cars that park in my parking garage.
And they have to say well -
To whom may you have spread this disease?
Then they get a list. .. And they go out and knock on the door. Say how do you do?
It's best you come to the public health department and be tested.
And treated.
And um -
That's not education though.
It's - .. public health.
{VOC breath} .. I guess it's education when they find them.
I say remove reproductive education. And we'll call it sex ed under the education.
Yeah.
And reproductive education and the weed control.
Is that okay with you, Cynthia?
Because we're going to get sex ed -
Anyway.
Right.
And weeds - .. well weeds - .. generally don't kill people. Sometimes controlling them kills people.
Right. So now we have two -
To go on education.
What's an acting coach?
I dunno.
Cooking classes. .. Is gone.
Yep.
Alright.
Okay. The answers are, we are going to remove, from education and programs cooking classes -
But we're keeping poetry books, right?
They're in the library. They're in the library.
So I would say we're removing -
Poetry books. I love poetry but we're removing that and what's the other thing? Cooking classes.
Yeah.
The cooking, you know, helps people know what's healthy but -
Okay.
But everything else is very important.
Alright. .. Are we agreed?
Poetry books and -
Cooking classes.
And cooking classes. {QUAL whispered}
You go to the library. Find them online.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Alright.
They're online.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I learned to make a good chocolate cake but uh -
Alright.
So we're agreed on the poetry books and the cooking classes?
Okay.
It's a hard one.
The next one - .. we agreed on reproductive education -
And weed control.
The next one we agreed on -
Yeah.
What - i- I'll tell you what they're thinking about. They're thinking about certificates of need for hospital beds.
That's what they're thinking.
Well, it just is there. .. Now if we were to find two under recreation and public services. .. We were there once.
Dog catcher was gone.
And reusable bags.
Okay. {QUAL whispered}
And infrastructure?
No that's important.
They were all go- Additional bus stops. We were -
Yeah.
Alright that's our f- our - our final answer there Valerie.
Um.
Okay. We're not done yet Valerie.
Alright. Um.
{VOC breath} Well, you know, you have a good point because it could be - .. preventing pregnancies.
And that has a *disastrous effect - .. on teenagers. .. Disastrous.
Maybe that needs to be in there.
And uh -
(Kudzu.)
Okay.
Why don't we - alright. We're changing our mind. .. Invasive species removal and weed control.
There you go. That's putting the humans first. Thank you Cynthia.
Alright. So here we go.
Uh. We eliminated on the first one -
Alright. That's our final answer. .. Poetry books and sugar free juice machines.
On the second thing, our final answer is invasive species removal -
Weed control.
And our third thing we came up with was - .. was it dog catcher? {QUAL whispered}
Dog catcher and reusable bag campaign.
And on the fourth one we came up with -
Additional bus stops -
And taxi stops.
We're done.
That was hard. {QUAL whispered}
Well I think it's better to just take a five percent cut across the board and let everybody, you know, cut the fat outta their own department. But - the - we'll go with this.
Yeah. It looks like.
Maybe one or - well yeah because they're
Mm-hm.
Oh. Okay.
Mm-hm.
Additional bus stops.
That's up for debate right now. {VOC laugh}
(Nah) It's public health.
Yeah.
It'd have- We're just cutting.
Boy I wouldn't wanna have this -
Taxi stops.
I would think you could get rid of the - of taxi stops.
Oh yeah. .. Specially in bad weather.
That would be like a license I would think.
Everything s- helps -
I thought maybe the taxi stops.
And -
The bus stops.
Can be fewer and farther between.
Uh. We can't get rid of the subway system that we don't have. .. We cannot get rid of {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} Wish we had one. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath}
Oh. Well let's look at the next and see - I don't know.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah that isn't - that wouldn't be the same, would it?
Mm-kay.
Now recreation. Uh -
Definitely keep s- stray cat spaying.
And public news station.
And the food bank.
What would you get rid of?
Uh. If you had to get rid of 'something {PRN some-ing} maybe reusable bag campaign.
I mean it's important but hopefully people are -
Yeah.
Uh.
Where?
Oh yes.
How many do we have to get rid of? Why don't we just get rid of one outta each one call it the budget. Did they say how many we have to do?
Where do you see that?
Oh.
Oh.
Mm.
Cause that could go private.
Yeah. You gotta -
Cuz they'll just breed more stray cats. {VOC laugh}
That sorta go- goes along - I think the veterinary hospital - I wonder if that is the same thing as like PAWS or something.
Or -
You know, where do they - ?
{VOC breath} Well the police do the dog catching, don't they?
Don't they have a department? I don't know.
Yeah.
Uh, I dunno. Sesame Street versus -
The news. {VOC laugh}
Oh wait til we get to public safety.
Now there's two things here. Education, sex ed and reproductive education. .. You could take one outta one of those lists.
Job training programs. (It's) chicken pox vaccinations.
Invasive species removal.
That's like -
They'll do it anyway.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Um.
Oh. It doesn't matter?
We might as well just go on down to public health too.
Um.
But we can choose - .. here or there.
Um. I would think this one.
'Or {PRN orb} to remove? Or to remove that one? Cuz they're sorta the same thing. This is - this is like -
In highschool, right? .. And this is like {VOC start} Planned Parenthood.
Mm.
Job training programs should stay. Chicken pox vaccinations should -
Well that could be don- Well.
Mm.
Oh.
Yeah this is.
Hm.
Toxic waste disposal, hospital additions.
Bagel factory inspections. {VOC breath} .. That's weird.
Yeah.
It sorta leads to to blight down the road though.
Egg farm regulations is sorta important. Everybody eats eggs.
Prenatal check-ups. .. Neighborhood watch support.
Mm-hm.
It's most - .. urgent.
Good heavens, this isn't easy is it? {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
What about the toxic waste disposal?
Take it off? Put it back next year? {VOC laugh} It's sorta like down the road kind of thing in a way.
That - yeah. Oh all that stuff's important.
Yeah.
Um.
Well they're sorta the same th-
Department. I mean they'd be done in the same place I would think. .. Or else this and this would be the same place.
Or that all three of them.
Are sorta -
Together {QUAL whispered}
Mm-hm.
Wow.
{VOC laugh} That's - yeah.
They're being informed of something they didn't know. {VOC laugh}
And we'll keep the sex ed.
Mm-kay.
Mm-kay.
Yeah. It's - it's uh -
One way or the other. .. It'll be kept over there.
Reducing blight. So I guess that a - a luxury in - in a way.
Kay.
Math tutors, assistant cooks, custodians - (??) {QUAL whispered}
I guess ones that they pay for as opposed to - my guess - volunteer.
Cooking classes.
Sugar free juice machines.
I'm all for books. They're in the library. .. Why would that be -?
Even part of the list?
Sugar fr-
Yeah. Cuz you can get em online anyway but {VOC laugh} I - I like to, you know - .. yeah it's hard.
That's true.
Mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yep.
Cause you can find poetry books.
{VOC start} Library.
Cooking classes you can't get for free I'm sure. But there's -
Or would they s- they wouldn't sign up for em. {VOC cough} .. Would kids do em if they didn't have em?
I dunno. I took cooking class in high school and it was totally worthless cause - {VOC laugh}
Oh that's good. Well we did stir-fry and something else but um -
I didn't take it with me. .. I - I learned cooking because - when I had to when I lived on my own for the first time.
(And) I learned it from my - .. from my friends.
But -
Cooking classes.
Mm-kay.
What about hospital additions? I know that's important but -
It's a lotta money.
That could -
But, you know - .. against -
Okay.
Yeah that's your - that's your line. Not mine.
(1x) Don't know.
Yeah.
Hunting tags.
That's right. It was the taxi stops and the bus stops.
Yeah.
I guess so.
I'm on the fence about this one though. Because (do you know) just can't have -
People gotta know what - where babies come from. {VOC laugh} Which is about - what it start - you know - in the basic way.
Dah that's okay.
That's okay.
Maybe they'll just bundle it into that.
We'll ext- ext- extend the S_T_D_
Yeah.
Now invasive s- Is this - species remo- is that like um -
(Gorst) and stuff {VOC laugh} (got all this) and just cl-
That goes along with weed control in a way.
Weed control. There we go.
The - .. What about this instead? Or - poetry books and cooking classes was it?
Or how bout poetry books and the sugar free juice machines.
Okay.
Juice machines.
And w-
And weed control.
Uh. Dog catcher and reusable bag campaign.
And taxi stops.
There we go.
I'm gonna take our - our answers and - over to the city council and - {VOC laugh}
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, sure.
You wanna go first?
Um.. that - that seems like - yeah, just put that next to the boating supplies. I doubt we'll have anything else that will be 'there. {PRN hair} {NVC} Here, I wanna d- {NVC} I wanna do one. {NVC}
I think this would be kind of in the construction area, but *close to siding.
So I'm gonna put it, like -
Well.. small axes *and mousetraps both kill things. How's this? Is that good? {QUAL laughing}
Wh- {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} (right) there, {NVC} okay. {QUAL laughing}
And this is our edibles, obviously, on the right here.
Um -
Well, I mean, this is, like, useless crap, and this is, like, *useful crap. {VOC laugh}
So, *useful inedible, *useless inedible.
Sure. Maybe put it just a *little bit closer to toilet paper?
That's fine with me.
Okay, so {NVC} let's do.. half-inch tubing. I'm assuming this is for, like -
Home improvement, you think?
Okay. So -
Not *quite deadly, {VOC breath} but construction-ish.
Yeah, alright.
{NVC} Moving on. {NVC}
{VOC mouthnoise} Well, this is in our - let's put is across from boating supplies, because if you fall (off) the boat -
Oh yeah, hey, how bout that? S- s- {NVC} So maybe, like, traveling stuff. Maybe fi- if we ever find car junk, we'll put it over {NVC} here.
Gas-powered cookstoves.
Y- y- yeah, okay. So -
We don't have anything *like this, kind of, I don't think.
Which is-
You think this is, like, a tiny portable one?
Alright, if we think it's a tiny portable one, then maybe we want it next to, like, travel guides? But, like, on the other side. So this is, like, fishing and then camping.
Or do you want it over here? .. Like -
Put it over here?
Just in case we find something else fishing, wanna put it right here?
Outdoors. Yeah, sounds good to me.
That's gonna be over here, but - {NVC} but *where over here?
So we've got healthy stuff and *unhealthy stuff. And then, the unhealthy stuff mixed together is over here.
Well, you can use oatmeal to, like, make cookies. Do you wanna put this, like.. over - cuz that's kind of a r- uh -
Yeah. Raw materials doesn't matter because we see eggs and sugar, like, in a - in different places. {NVC} I'm {NVC} happy with {NVC} that.
Books.
Um.
Useful s- crap.
Huh.
We agree that it's in this one, right? The middle one?
Okay. So d- maybe we could put it next to toys! I mean, those a- th- they're for entertainment. {VOC breath} {NVC} So let's do that.
That's gonna be over here somewhere, right?
Yes. Put it next to the axes. {QUAL laughing}
Okay, let's see. Backpacks, that's traveling stuff. 'I'm gonna {PRN ahmuhnuh} put it *across from the gas-powered cookstove, because -
Cuz then it's, like, already on your back.. n- you're looking at cookstoves. I don't {NVC} know.
Uh - {QUAL lengthened}
So, we have, like, this - 'I don't know. {PRN /aɪdno/} This isn't quite arts and crafts yet.
{VOC mouthnoise} I think I'd put it next to here, with all our sharp things.
{VOC laugh} Sharp and potentially deadly things. {QUAL amused}
Um.. across from ice cream, obviously - no. Uh -
No, this is in fishing supplies.
Um.
We could put {VOC start} like -
Our unhealthy stuff is, like, kind of in this area. Maybe we should just stick it across from the sugar?
Yeah.
Right, right. True. Like, so this is consumable.. but where do we want it? Like, how are we ranging this?
Like, soybeans are healthy, sugar is not. So this is, like, the unhealthy half, and this is the healthy half. {VOC breath}
But s- s- whiskey's usually, like, on the *end of the aisle.. Do we wanna, like, put it at the end?
Okay.
Oh, that's gonna be over here somewhere.
Kind of in the middle, maybe?
What do you think?
Yeah, sure. {NVC}
I'm {NVC} not really {NVC} particular about where my bottles of juice go.
*Loose-leaf paper.
Next to the books, maybe?
Yeah, books are made of paper.
{VOC laugh} I don't know how people shop. {QUAL laughing}
Um -
Maybe next to the travel guides. Maybe just, like, stick them up here.
Shoelaces. Oh, are we gonna run into clothes?
Maybe we should, like, reserve this area for clothes.
What do you think?
I don't know. They c- it could creep into toys.
Here, I'm just gonna stick this, like -
Here-{NVC} ish. {QUAL lengthened 'here'}
And then we can, like, fill this area with other clothes items if we needed. {VOC mouthnoise}
Oh.. next - right here. {NVC} Yeah.
That goes with boats.
'It's {PRN s} gonna be bad.
Paper bags.
That's like packing lunches, right?
Yeah! Tha- no, that's a good idea! I like that idea. I'm gonna put that here.
{VOC mouthnoise} Uh-oh.
Yeah.
'Sure. {PRN /tʃɹ/} That's fine.
D- we just - we did the best we could, under the circumstances. Socks.
Right across from 'shoelaces. {PRN shoelacesss} Maybe *up one. {NVC} Just in case we {NVC} find boots to put {NVC} there.
Oh. Um -
Next to our - yeah, next to cord-y thingies.
{VOC mouthnoise} {NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} I'm happy with that.. Like, *normally I'd put that near boating supplies, but.. whatever.
Uh, I'd put that in the healthy section. Next to the soybeans, maybe.. Are we allowed to put them down there?
Yeah, let's try to - we'll rai- we'll, like.. scope ourselves between the things.
Liters of water.
Next to bottles of juice!
'That's {PRN hats} how I see - that's how *I see stores. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Um.. {VOC mouthnoise} yeah, maybe put them next to the boots. The fleece-lined boots, because we're getting into, like -
Um -
This is, like, the warm stuff.
Like, if you're going ou- this is the outdoors. And then -
Books of matches.
Yeah it would. Maybe we just put it next to here. As close to the stove as we could. {QUAL laughing}
Alright.
{NVC} We {NVC} go.
Uh, down here, probably. This is, like toiletries.
Just in case. Alright, {NVC} sounds good to {NVC} me.
Bars of soap.. (1x) just snap that next to the face cream.
Hm.
Maybe - we're kinda going in to kitchen stuff here, like with 'this - {PRN lengthened /ð/ and /ɪ/} I mea- {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
'Do you  {PRN d'you} wanna just start yo- doing that here?
But we *do have refrigerator magnets here. We *could put it over here.
D- no, technically you already put it up, so you can't move it.
It's fine, I don't care. Well, I can already see heavy {NVC} cable, {NVC} so - {NVC}
Put that next to the tow ropes.
{VOC start} Um.. well here's our, like, electric crap
Put it on the other side of the power cords.. That would kinda make sense. So you can plug in your electric heater. That makes -
*Exactly!
That's pretty healthy. I'll put it next to the {VOC breath} eggs, cuz they kind of sound the same.. Figs and eggs.
Um.. yeah, somewhere in here.
Yeah, sure. {NVC} That's good.
Sticks of butter. {VOC breath} That goes -
Eggs and sticks of but- yeah, that's dairy.
Yeah, we don't really have milk anywhere else, so that's fine.
{NVC} Good idea.
Next - next to th- {VOC mouthnoise}
Oh, right next to the sugar.
That makes se- I think that makes sense
This is, like, kind of our cold area.
Cans of peas.
That 'would {PRN w} be down here, right?
Yeah, that's -
Hm.. Just in case some of this comes in, I think (I'm gonna) put it right y- like, bout here?
Yeah, these are f- this is, like, {NVC} fresh stuff over {NVC} here.
Sharp objects. Next to the small axes. Yes!
Doing *some good.
*Mint toothpaste.. Next to toilet paper? That's, like, toiletries.
Oh, do we want that next to the eggs or in, like, the random section?
Next to refrigerator magnets!
Um -
This is outdoorsy. But, this is, like, on the - this is, like, the outside stuff, and this is, like, the {VOC mouthnoise} tools, or whatever. {NVC} I don't know.
Hm, hm. {QUAL high, then low pitch}
Take your pick! Somewhere in here.
Sounds good.
Tweezers. That's, like -
Toiletry tools.. Like.. how bout next to toothpaste?
Like.. that.. sounds like they kind of {NVC} go {NVC} together.
Um, how bout next to the packages of cookies, yes! {QUAL excited on 'packages of cookies'}
Five-pound {QUAL laughing} *weights?! {QUAL incredulous} We don't have *workout areas. Maybe next to the toys?
You think s- ?
Well, let's look at this for a second.
I wouldn't -
They're not really {VOC breath} blunt weapons.
Or sharp weapons.. This is all kinda done.
I think they're more recreational, which is why I'd put it up here. And this is more, like, I need to build my house.
'Would you {PRN /wʒu/} mind here?
Okay. {QUAL creaky}
'Go {PRN /ŋo/} ahead.
What?! {QUAL very high pitch} {VOC laugh} Who sells that?
Um. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Put it, like, near this stuff. Maybe, like, put it here? Or here?
Yeah. Yeah, {QUAL high pitch} okay.
Yeah, you can cut them with scissors, cuz they're s- they're {VOC start} little sticks. They're not - d- if it was bundles of wood, maybe use -
Pre-cut wood. Maybe next to the saws and axes?
Huh.. clothes.
{NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} Without looking, I got.. bagels.
'Do we {PRN dwee} got bread stuff?
Pouches of oatmeal.
Yeah, put it next to the pre-cut wood, maybe?
'Let's {PRN n} see what we got. {VOC breath}
Rolls of duct tape.
That.. should be, like, right here, next to the box knives?
Exactly. {NVC}
Um.
'Put it next {PRN /pdɛs/} to the large cups, cuz they are containers also.
Let's see -
Heavy coats. Next to the thick sweaters!
Oh, good, we're done.
Next to ice cream, yeah.
Yeah.. uh, good thing, too.
'Yeah. {PRN spoken as laugh} We only messed up a little bit cuz of the 'overpopulation {PRN oferpopulation} here.
Uh, we're done!
'If {PRN f} you'd like to come in and rescue us again.
We just do, {NVC} uh, one at a time, then?
Okay, so.. yes, let's {NVC} do a {NVC} random draw.
Uh, fishing net.
S- s- gotta be near here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Alright, go ahead. {NVC} Yeah, go for it.
Ah- uh - {VOC hesitation} Yeah yeah yeah.
Uh -
Yeah, that's true. Any - any - any deadly weapons. Yeah.
Kay, {NVC} let's {NVC} see.
We got - we got empty plastic jugs.
Maybe - I feel like it should be r- somewhere around refrigerator magnets or something.
Yeah. Yeah yeah, let's do that. Let's do (2x).
Yeah. Yeah yeah. This is, like, Home Depot a- part.
Yeah, yeah, this l- that {NVC} looks good.

Kay, books.
'Don't know {PRN /n:oʊ/} if we have anything like books.
Maybe books and - {QUAL lengthened}
Yeah, I agree.

There's a couple - {VOC hesitation} Yeah, there's a couple arguments. Um -
Mm, yeah. Just keep all the weapons together. Yes.
Uh. {QUAL lengthened, creaky}
It's gotta be s- {VOC hesitation}

Mm -
That's true, yeah. Let's keep it on the end. Let's just keep it on the end. Yeah.

Oh, yeah, that's true. You always see flags near i- travel books.
Shoelaces.
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
Uh, do we have enough room?
Oh, that's true. That's fine. Yeah.
Yeah, we'll just - {VOC hesitation} (do) a little placeholder there. Yeah.
Yeah. 'We'll {PRN w} use it as {NVC} a placeholder. Canvas bags.
Nice. Perfect
Yep.
Paper bags.
Mm-hm.
Maybe - maybe.. here?
Okay.
See, fish hooks. Oh, dang.
Well, we kinda hafta -

Oh, nice. You called it! You called it.
Beets.

Nice. Beverages
Large vests.. is clothes, right?

Oh, yeah yeah.
Books of matches.
That'd go well with, like, the camping stuff.

'It's {PRN s} kind of random
Oh.
Oh, that's true.. That's true, yeah yeah. Let's do that. Yeah, that's good. {NVC}
Alright, bundles of sticks.
{VOC start} Who sells - yeah. What kinda store has this?
Bundles of sticks. I guess it's kinda.. outdoorsy?
Yeah, let's do (next to the) scissors. {NVC} (??) middle o-
Yeah.
Yes, perfect. Perfect.
(Alright), we got thick sweaters.
{VOC start} Yep.
Ooh.
N- {QUAL lengthened} I don't think so.
Yeah, let's - let's keep it - yeah. All that stuff's in the middle already.
Okay, bags of peat moss. This is definitely outdoors, like, home improvement.
Yeah, 'that's {PRN s} good.
Yeah.
You need the box knies to cut {NVC} the {NVC} duct {NVC} tape!
Buckets.
Maybe, li- I 'would {PRN w} say here or here?
Oh, okay.. Yes.
Nice!
And, chocolate bars.
(Like), next to ice cream, yep.
(Well) we got less food than I thought.
Huh.
Yeah. This one filled up a lot.
Yeah.
Alright!
{VOC mouthnoise} Have to cut the *same number of items from each column
No.
We're good, we're good!
Gotta cut the same number of items. So -
I think we'll go through a list and be, like, this is how many useless things we found, and then we'll cut that same number.
But if it - i- but the- be - maybe if we agree that it's too low then we'll switch it up.
So {QUAL breathing out loudly} let's just think about these things. Math tutors, assistant cooks, sex ed, custodians, speech therapy, football equipment, acting coaches, poetry books, special ed teachers, *cooking classes, notetakers, sugar-free juice machines - {QUAL laughing}
Bookkeeping classes, and music teachers.
I think we can - {VOC start} th- any one that jump out at you?
Yeah, I think so too. {VOC mouthnoise} Bring your own juice.
And b- I think bookkeeping classes.
Why would you need an education program {QUAL laughing on 'education program'} for that?
Um -
How bout, uh, assistant cooks?
Because you already *have cooks, why do you need assistant cooks? The cooks will 'just {PRN /dʒ/} have to work a little harder, I'm sorry.
Let's keep k- sex ed.
Let's keep custodians! They're really important
Um. {VOC start}
Oh, cooking *classes? Yeah, cut that. That's not really necessary. We got the internet. (1x) learn on your o- learn on your own.
Uh, special ed teachers we kinda need, because that - well - we'll run into that. Math is important.
Speech therapy is.. pre- um -
So, the thing about speech therapy is, we would either - we would either need them - if we cut that, we'd need the to do that on their own, which is kinda n- of -
Kind of a burden.
We could cut - d- we c- yeah, w-
I guess -
That's - well, I mean, it's just a program, it's, like, an acting program. So we have, like, the music program, we got the math program. I might wa- we - maybe we keep the acting one, and we cut the poetry books.
{VOC breath} Because we - {VOC laugh} s-
Get your own boo- !
Go to the library! Yeah, do that.
So how bout we cut five {VOC start} from each of these?
Okay. {QUAL lengthened} {VOC breath} S- So let's just read all of them. Prob- reproductive, job training, chicken pox, invasive species removal, S_T_D_ education, toxic waste disposal -
Hospital additions, *bagel factory inspections, needle exchange, sex offender database -
Veterans medical assistance, egg farms regulations, weed control, pre-'natal {PRN nolo} checkups, neighborhood watch support.
Things that jump out at me -
Um -
Get rid of the *needle exchange.
Uh - {VOC laugh} That is - I don't know what that is, but it seems terrible.
Uh - let's get rid of the neighborhood watch support.
Invasive species removal and I think weed control overlap, so - and I think weed control does *less. And so I think we could get rid of tha- is that three?
And stupid. {QUAL laughing}
Let's get rid of that. {VOC mouthnoise}
Um -
I think we're going to k- have to keep.. toxic waste disposal. That seems important.
Vaccinations are important, {VOC start} job training is important, reproductive is important.
That's true. {QUAL high pitch} Maybe if we cut the S_T_D_ education, we can just keep 'reproductive? {PRN /ɹɛipɹdəkʃɹ/}
Sure! Let's do - let's 'do {PRN /dœ/, lengthened} that.
I think pre-natal checkups is fine, I guess.
Yeah, sure, we'll keep it in.
Okay. (Over) to recreation public services. What we got? We got stray cat spaying, public news station, food bank, junior soccer league, kitten puppy adoption, {QUAL laughing} soup kitchens, housing assistance, dog catcher -
Boy's basketball club, public access station, reusable bag campaign, veterinary hospital, 'football {PRN food} stadium upkeep and *pest control!
U- I don't know how badly this neighborhood needs a dog catcher.
What? Where - where are we? Are we doing this for a county? Like, county-wide dog catcher? I don- I don't see k- dog catchers.. I think  - I don't think we have to worry about that.
Yeah, don't think that's a h- I don't think that's a problem right now.
So that's two we can get rid of.
Um - {QUAL lengthened} {NVC}
Hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} How bout public 'access {PRN /æsɛk/} station?
Just cuz there's not a lot of (1x) - football stadium upkeep! Let's get rid of that.
I don't care about the football stadium.
{VOC mouthnoise} I (think) the public news station would be - {VOC mouthnoise} we - we should probably keep *one of these.
Uh, keep - {VOC hesitation}
I like soccer more than basketball.
Okay, that's five.
Teaching certificates.. speed limit signs, additional bus stops, tattoo artist licenses, that's going away.
Pothole maintenance, subway system, hunting tags, towing services, massage certificates, flagpole repair, taxi stops -
*Fishing licenses -
Public bus upkeep -
Drainage ditches.
Ooh, this is gonna be tough.
We got the pot - {VOC hesitation} tattoo artist licenses, we can get rid of that because you can look at the art on their wall or get recommendations or whatever. You don't really need a *license to do that.
Teaching certificate. I think you 'freaking {PRN ffffreakin} need those.
Speed limit signs.. Uh - {QUAL louder} {VOC laugh}
I don't know about those, actually. I don't know.
Um, additional bus stops -
I know how bad bussing is.
But the subway system is, like, a centralized thing. {VOC start} I don't know.
Subway system kinda goes, like - is the *main.. s- stop- thing, and then you take buses around, like, the outsides an- and junk. I think you need *both of those.
All these things are pretty p- important. Oh, oh, oh.. oh, let's get rid of that.
Massage certificates, get out.
Flagpole repa- Get it - get out!
'Repair {PRN pair} your own.. freaking flag.
Yeah, get rid of that.. (Oh good), this (is becoming) easier.
I think we need to keep drainage ditches.
Why don't we just get rid of speed limit signs? No one follows them anyway.
You could get rid of towing services. We can keep it privatized.
Yeah, no one uses government towing services. That's silly.
Alright, that's five! We're good.
{VOC breath} You didn't even know what they were! {VOC breath}
We could've cut the toxic waste disposal, you (with) *no *idea!
Let's {QUAL laughing} just build the worst -
The worst community ever.
Oh yeah, that one was fun.
Okay.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah, we got it.
Alright, so -
Maybe we should, uh, pick - either pick a - a number right now -
Or just go through a list, and then, like, pick based on th-
Yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah. Okay. So, let's go through education and programs.
*That one's getting cut.
Sugar-free juice machines.
Yep.
Yeah, bookkeeping classes.
Uh, so that's - that's two.
Um - {VOC start}
Cooking -
Assistant cooks.
Yeah.
Um.
Yes. {VOC laugh} We don't want the toi- toilets to overflow. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Um.. {VOC mouthnoise}
Cooking classes - I feel like you could cut, too. You don't really - generally don't have that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe acting coaches could be cut?
Yeah. I don't know what that -
That seems like, if you wan-
Yeah, if you wanna do that, you can do that on your own.
We're not tr- th- like, how many actors are there gonna be?
Oh, I see, I see.
Oh, I see, I see, I see.
Yeah, let's do poetry. Let's do poetry.
Yeah, you go th- go the library! Go to the library! {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Okay, we got five. Yeah, five cut. Okay, sounds good.
'Let's {PRN s} go on to public health.
Um, let's see -
Yeah.
Yeah. That's - that's - {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Yeah. {QUAL laughing}
Yeah, I agree.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, I would do - we'll do weed control.
I feel like bagel factory inspections is very specific.
Okay. We have one more.
Yeah.
'I {PRN h} feel like reproductive and S_T_D_ is very similar. One of tho- is kinda - kinda - k-
Yeah, yeah, we could just cover in reproductive, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That looks good.
Okay. Recr-
Think dog catcher {VOC breath} stands out for me.
Yeah. {QUAL laughing} How many - how many, like, feral dogs and cats are there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't think (we) have to worry about stray cats, either. Like, {VOC start} 'there's {PRN /z/} not that many, like -
Abandoned animals.
Yeah.. Just so they- they don't produce more.
Yeah, i- yeah.
Yep.
Yep.
Hm.
Yeah.
And even -
Yeah, yeah, tha- there's four. I - I feel we could even get rid of the public news station.
Oh, that's true, that's true.
Uh, let's see -
We could cut - we could cut one of the sports.. So we have boy's basketball club and junior soccer league.
Okay. That's fine.
{VOC laugh} Yeah, yeah.
Okay, that's five. We got that one. Now, infrastructure and licensing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Obviously need those.
Kind of import-
Well, if we get a *subway system we don't need these additional bus stops.
Oh, that's true.
Oh, that's true. That's true.
Yeah. I feel li- may-
I really don't know.
Maybe we can get rid of them. {VOC laugh}
Oh yeah. Okay.. There you go.
Flagpole repair, get out! {QUAL laughing}
Get out! {QUAL laughing}
Yeah. Uh, so we just 'need {PRN n} to pick one more.
Yes, we definitely do.
What about, um -
What was the one I was looking at? {QUAL to self}
Yeah, that's what I was thinking of.
Yeah, it's already privatized for the most part.
So.
Yeah.
Nice. We got it.
What is th- y- {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
We coulda - {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
Yep.. yeah.
There's no way to lose.
Yeah, it's, like.. Sims City. Where, like, your town is just, like, a nuclear wasteland.
Yeah. {NVC} {VOC mouthnoise}
I guess. Yeah. .. I guess you and I just went into business together. Um.
Kay. Large vests.
I actually wanna pass on this one, cuz I don't know whether they mean vests like -
You know, like a -
Patagonia fleece vest, or do they mean like a, .. you know - .. Anyway.
Yeah. That's - That's what I'm wondering. .. Like a *life vest.
Yeah.
Yeah. Alright. Yeah, yeah, yeah. .. No, it's good.
I'm not even gonna go there. I just - {QUAL laughing} Actually, I will. {VOC breath} So I was at Portland for this, um, ..
Oh really?
So it was down - It was down at the Mariott -
Oh. .. Too bad. Sorry.
{VOC breath} But it - it, you know, it's kinda fun. I mean, auditors love to make fun of themselves. It's like, you know - ..
{VOC start} The great thing about hanging out with auditors is that they're - It's kind of like hanging out with accountants. Except {VOC breath} not - They - Auditors don't have quite the scintillating personality.
{VOC breath} You know? {VOC laugh} Um.
But, there was this -
Yes, exactly. There was this - There was this one - .. This - There was a little bit of whiskey. .. Um. Just a little. .. Actually more, .. you know, like, uh,
artisanal beer-kinda stuff. {VOC breath} Um.
{VOC mouthnoise} .. Yeah. Yeah. We had a good time.
{VOC breath} But this one guy was giving a presentation, um, from the G_A_O_.
No. .. No, no no. I heard about that. I think (that) - I - .. Was that about Clinton? I thought that was like, Obama's people. {VOC breath} Um. {VOC mouthnoise}
And then, I turned out, and then they started speaking into their wrists, {QUAL breathy quoting voice} and - and I realized, Oh, they're also part of the Secret Service. And I'm like, you can't - What are you doing, man? Like, you can't do that! {QUAL pinched, high-pitched voice}
Like, (it was just) {QUAL pinched voice} .. crazy sexist. It was - It was a little .. awkward. {VOC breath} Um. {VOC breath} Yeah, like -
Some- Somebody needs to explain that it's twenty fourteen. {VOC breath} Okay.
Tow ropes. .. I think that would go next to boating supplies. Alright.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's a great idea.
(Well) (1x) We could go near the sugar, ice cream kinda stuff.
{VOC breath} (??) I mean, if they have pop and .. you know, .. {VOC start} .. other - *Gatorade, or whatever.
Yeah. {VOC breath} Yeah.
Yeah, let's put it next to the toilet paper. .. Think so.
(??) The hard part is remembering what we've put and - {VOC breath}
Can't move the other ones. {QUAL muttering} Scissors.
Maybe up by the refrigerator magnets?
Kay. {VOC breath}
Yeah. {VOC breath}
Yeah.
Perfect.
Do we even have any?
Yeah. .. {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC mouthnoise} .. Um. {VOC breath}
What if we - We've got this whole kind of open area. Here, I'm gonna do something weird.
{VOC breath} Yeah. Um. {VOC breath}
Yeah, let's just - Yeah. .. We'll just take over the middle of that aisle. {VOC breath}
Egg timers. Where was the, um -
Like, .. next to refrigerator magnets, maybe?
Yeah. Totally.
Kay.
That's interesting that you did that, cuz I actually did the opposite.
Yeah, I assumed that this was the aisle, and these were the walls.
You know? {VOC breath}
It does- I don't think it matters. .. You know. We'll just try and be logic about it.
{VOC breath} Yeah. {QUAL lengthened} {VOC breath} .. Yeah.
{NVC} Yeah, or even down here. *If there's things like the axes and the -
wood products and other stuff.
Kay. .. Cuz see, I still got this heavy cable. I got the large vests in my hand.
Or I can hang onto it.
Cuz - {VOC breath} I do think that these are all .. something in the same category. .. Unless we hafta deal with the clothes. But I'll pull that one out there.
You know.
Food. {VOC breath}
Perfect. {VOC breath} Yep. {VOC breath}
Dried figs.
Same thing.
'You wanna {PRN ya'wa} do that? {VOC breath}
Okay. .. Okay.
{VOC start} I - It - It work- Let's just see how crowded it gets. I mean, that's the other thing.
Buckets.
Put it with the siding.
{VOC laugh} You know. I g- Yeah.
Yeah.
Box knives. .. {VOC start} {VOC breath} See, I think we're all kind of in this - Box knives, buckets - {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} .. {VOC breath} Um.
Yeah, where did we put the scissors?
Let's put it with the scissors.
Liters of water. Um.
Maybe with the juice? {VOC breath}
Somewhere in that area?
Yeah.
Empty plastic jugs.
Buckets?
Kay. {VOC breath}
Axes. .. {VOC laugh}
(1x) Okay.
{VOC breath} W- Um. I'm gonna do this. So small axes. We can move em around later. Heavy cable.
{VOC breath} I'm just - Here, actually, I'll put the heavy cable with the power cords.
{VOC breath} But all these kind of things -
The box knives.
Yeah.
But these - These are all - {VOC start} They seem like Home Depot kind of .. *stuff. You know?
Maybe next to the -
(??) .. (1x) Okay. That works. {VOC breath}
End of - End of the aisle?
(Put it there.) {QUAL whispering} {VOC breath}
Sticks of butter. Um. .. I think butter should go near the eggs.
Dairy 'products. {PRN long /s/} Um. {VOC breath}
Yeah. Yep. {VOC breath} Totally.
Um.
Here maybe? .. I'm - I'm thinking like somewhere in the clothing area.
Kay. .. The pro- You know what's gonna happen though, Peter? I'm gonna forget which ones we had pre-assigned and which ones we put here.
Well -
(Yeah.)
Absolutely! I - .. Okay.
Okay.
Um.
I totally remember Eve's Buffet. Yes!
Alright.
No, yeah. The - The *Stadium Fred Meyer. Absolutely. So I useta, um, .. catch the fifty-one bus,
down and then switch to the twenty-two and catch it up Burnside,
{VOC breath} to school, and so -
Yeah. {VOC breath} Yeah. .. So, um -
Yeah, I've - I've .. spent some *quality time at the Stadium Fred Meyer.
{VOC breath} Now I'm trying to remember - There was like, you know, you'd go downtown, and there were a couple record stores I go to, like Django's and Dudley's and stuff,
I almost wanna say like a *Tower Records. I think it was a Tower Records. Or it mighta been a -
Any - It mighta been Fred Meyer's, right? But there was that weird, kind of off building that was on the corner .. of Burnside.
And I would - .. You know, if I had ten minutes to kill, I'd go in and look and see what - .. what was - .. what was happening music-wise.
Yeah. {VOC breath} ..
(1x) (They did it.)
Yeah.
Well that was - You know - .. In - In an era of hair metal, that was one of the few places where you could get cool things.
{VOC breath} Uh. {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} Yeah.
Oh yeah. .. Um. I - I remember I - .. What did I -?
I bought .. Sound Garden there. .. I bought a bunch of stuff there.
{VOC breath} Okay. Um. Rolls of duct tape. {VOC breath}
This - This area, in the .. bottom of the first aisle. {VOC breath} .. Yeah.
Why not with the travel guides? Yeah. {VOC breath}
Yeah, I think so. Here.
(We'll) move that.
Large cups.
Yep. .. Yep. .. Totally. {VOC breath}
Pouches of oatmeal. Same - Somewhere in there. .. Maybe - Maybe here. It's like dried goods.
H- Half-inch tubing. {VOC breath} .. That's a power cords - .. No, that would work.
Yeah.
I dunno what - What d-
{VOC breath} Um. {VOC breath}
Yes. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} Um.
I think - I think it might be. {QUAL laughing} Uh.
See, this one to me, it's like it - {VOC breath}
Does he?
Hm!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} I - I think, in terms of the whiskey, .. this is another one we should hang onto.
No. .. No. Not - I - I was tempted to put it across from the toys, and then I - {VOC laugh}
You could put this in a stand-alone almost anywhere. I'd probably put it at the end, by like, books or something. I mean -
{VOC breath} Um.
So, yeah, let's hang onto that one.
Yeah. .. {VOC laugh}
Um.
Ri-
Bars of soap, maybe?
Yeah.
Canvas bags. {QUAL muttering} .. Um.
Yeah. Or maybe next to the mouse traps? {VOC breath} Cuz this is all gonna be plastic stuff, right?
Okay.
Yeah.
That's - I think that's good for now.
Pre-cut wood. {VOC breath}
I'm gonna move the heavy cable.
Yeah.
Do that. .. Like that, or something.
Yes.
Totally. Here. In fact, {VOC breath} .. put it by the soap. {VOC breath}
Maybe it's just mint.
Beets. .. Uh, beets with the -
soy beans, cans of peas, all that .. stuff.
Now the soy beans were permanent, right?
Yeah. {VOC breath} .. Okay. {VOC breath} Cuz we may need to move the oatmeal, and the dried - You know, like - {VOC breath} Kay.
Just move it up.
Light jackets.
Wet suits.
Can we put the wet suits there?
With the - .. With the boating supplies?
(Ack.) What do you use a five-pound weight for? {QUAL whispering}
Could be. It could be like a *diving thing. .. Yeah.
Yeah.
I think - I think - .. Yeah, I think that'd be -
heavy. .. {VOC breath} Um. {VOC breath}
Right.
Well, I mean, you might -
That's what I'm saying, if you go diving. .. But - (??) That's actually a *lot. .. Like -
You know. {VOC breath} ..
{VOC start} .. Yeah. {VOC breath}
Or (a) - You might put, like, five or ten pounds. You - {VOC laugh} You wouldn't have like {QUAL laughing} a series of five-pound weights. {VOC breath}
(We'll just) .. throw it in there.
Um.
Why don't we put it with the weights? Same kinda thing.
Yeah.
Fleece-lined boots. {VOC breath} Um. {VOC breath} Were the socks here? .. We put all of this here, right? We picked that.
Put the boots there.
Hm. {QUAL lengthened}
Put it right there. {QUAL muttering}
Yeah.
Good call.
Okay. But we can - we can .. fix this. We could move - {QUAL lengthened}
The siding hasta stay there.
What if we do this? {VOC breath}
Yeah. .. We could do that.
I'm thinking of moving them all up, though, so they're next to the siding, too. .. (Go see -) You gotta cut siding.
So.
Do this. {QUAL muttering}
The plastic jugs just kinda ended up over there.
Sure.
Yeah, there you go.
Yes.
Yeah. {VOC breath}
Bagels.
I say canvas bag.
And I say bagels. .. Yes.
Yeah. {VOC breath}
'Uh {PRN long /i/} yeah. That'll work.
Yeah.
The flags. Where - .. Um. .. Let's put the flags here. .. Just - {VOC start} (1x)
Right.
You could do that. Um. I actually think we should put vests there for now.
Yeah. .. That works. .. That's perfect.
Yeah. .. Put em there.
Yeah. So we could put em -
there.
Kay. .. Cases of whiskey.
Right next to the toys. {VOC laugh} (n) Um.
I think so. Here- Here's - I do wanna do this, though. I know this is .. neurotic. Um. I wanna move -
the saws and axes and stuff next to the siding. .. Because -
Yeah.
Yeah. .. And then the buckets, we can just -
I dunno. Buckets are fine there.
We could do that. {VOC breath}
Right.
M- S- .. Switch the - {VOC breath} .. Yep. {VOC breath}
Buckets, rolls of duct tape, half-inch tubing.
Mouse 'traps. {PRN trass}
Mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} .. Um.
The only other thing - Well, for deck chairs, like a home deck -
Boating supplies. But I think we're fine.
I think that's close enough.
We could - {VOC breath}
We could do this.
We could do that. We can't move the .. power cords, though. {VOC breath} That was one of the permanent ones. {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} We could do this.
Like that?
And then move the knives in. {VOC breath}
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Well that's - And that's kinda what I'm looking at. Like, .. {VOC breath} if you assume they had to be equal in some .. proportion. Like this one's equal, but there's a lot less in these two.
I can't remember.
{VOC laugh} (Th-) There you go.
No, that's good. {VOC breath} .. Yeah.
The - .. It was cake mix. .. Cake mix hasta be there.
Yeah.
Yeah. .. You could move - {QUAL lengthened} ..
You know, you could m- we could move packages of cookies up there with the doughnuts and the ice cream and the chocolate bars and stuff.
Okay. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, let's declare victory.
We'll just move on. .. And s- I - You know f- .. Yes. .. Well done, sir! .. Um.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, if they mean a - like a boating supply thing.
That might be .. the best place to go. But it looks what they've - they want us to do here {QUAL lengthened} are put the, um, food -
on the right. .. {VOC breath} And then in the middle, like domestic supplies.
{VOC breath} And then on the left, like, more kind of, .. man stuff.
{VOC laugh} Or - {VOC laugh} I probably shouldn't say that, but - {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} D- In quotes, you know.
Oh.
{VOC breath} Actually, our professional organization is having a conference in Portland next week.
Yeah, the 'TESOL {PRN /'ti.sal/} conference is in Portland this year.
But I'm not going. {VOC breath} {VOC laugh}
Mm. Mm-hm.
Yeah. .. Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Ah, kay. Okay. Okay.
Being slightly sarcastic again. I - {VOC laugh}
But plenty of whiskey, right?
Oh, okay, yeah. That's what Portland's more famous for, right? Yeah.
Hm.
That wasn't the one that got in trouble down in South America, was it?
Okay. .. You know about that, right?
Okay, yeah, that was a different -
Oh, maybe it was Obama, yeah.
I can't 'remember. {PRN member}
Yeah, yeah. {QUAL lengthened}
Yeah.
{VOC breath} Uh, and then go back - Kinda like flash cards. Where you don't something, you just go straight - .. Put it back.
{VOC breath} Bottles of juice? .. That's obviously a -
{VOC breath} Unless it would be a - .. {VOC mouthnoise}
I mean, it would be a domestic supply, right?
{VOC breath} Oh, the weird thing though, is this is fixed, right? {VOC breath}
But the egg timers - {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
I wonder if they have kitty litter. That'll be really (funny).
{VOC breath} Yeah. (Bec-) Yeah. Things to drink. Drinkable -
{VOC breath} things. Um.
I wonder if there was some other, .. uh -
{VOC breath} Well, um - It's funny. I'm totally Fred Meyering all this.
{VOC breath} But i- if it's like *this at all, the thing we already did, they - they're not gonna have a lotta things that are related to books. {VOC breath} Yeah. {QUAL lengthened} It's gotta go - gotta go there. {VOC breath}
Uh, cups? {VOC breath} That's gotta go with the buckets, right? Maybe?
Ah, your favorite.
{VOC breath} And every Christmas, we'll go over to Murphy's here, or some other - *Murphy's cuz it's open on Christmas, right?
{VOC breath} It's the *only place that's open on Christmas, that I know of.
{VOC breath} And so we'll get, like, an Irish coffee or something like that. {QUAL lengthened} And Jameson whiskey, and he really likes that, so. It's kind of a little family treat.
Hm.
{VOC breath} Yeah, that's (a be) good one to hang on and - Or you could just take it home, you know?
{VOC breath} Yeah.
{VOC breath} Mint. Is there gonna be cinnamon and .. spearmint or -
{VOC breath} Five-pound weights.
{VOC breath} Electric heaters. Those have gotta go next to the power cords, right?
{VOC breath} Bagels? .. Not - .. {VOC start} Do you say bagels or *baggles?
Yeah. Cuz we're not gonna have other .. book stuff, right? .. We're almost at the end. {VOC breath}
Hats. {VOC breath} Would be with the coats, and -?
{VOC breath} {VOC start} Was this the one that was .. definite?
{VOC laugh} I just think it's really funny. {QUAL laughing} Oh, the only thing is, though, that uh -
So, basically, cut or .. continue funding.
That's kinda like being in the government.
Uh, the uh, budget subcommittee, or whatever.
Senate .. budget subcommittee.
Can't remember who sits on that now.
Um.
Well, does it say how much we're suppo- how many we're sposta take out? Or we just -?
Oh.
So we'd like, take .. two outta here and two outta here and two outta here and two outta here, or something like that?
Well, math tutors, I mean, we don't need math tutors. Uh. If kids can't add, then they're just hopeless.
I mean, {VOC breath} they need to, you know. What -
All they need to do is buy a text book. (And uh) If they can't -
you know, pay attention in class, and do their homework, and read the text book, then it's like - {VOC breath}
they should just become English majors.
Well, I think they should *try it for a while, but then if it -
if they just flunking out, it's like, switch to sociology or something.
{VOC mouthnoise} Mm-kay.
Seems like a w-
Seems like a waste of time, but alright.
Oh, we hafta have that. {VOC breath} Because -
Well, because -
Because if we're -
hiking through the wilderness in Canada, and we've got twenty miles to go to the next -
town, we're gonna need somebody to cook for us, right?
Oh, yeah, okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Plus you'd probably disagree with them after a while anyway. It'd be like, you know, it's like, hey, I don't like the way you made this. I just wanna make it myself.
Cuz nobody can really -
Yeah, yeah. It could get dangerous after a while.
Well, that's beyond question, right?
Well that never stops, right? Your whole life, right? I mean, you -
need that when you're (in) - {VOC breath}
You need that even more when you're in your seventies.
Okay.
Um, let's see. Custodians?
Uh, well, I mean, you know. Depends on whether or not it's a union shop.
Cuz you gonna hafta deal with the -
um, the stewards.
(Mm) they got a pretty powerful lobby. Well,
it real- what it really comes down to is whether or not this is teamsters.
Well, yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Right, yeah, yeah. That's pretty -
I've seen the classrooms here. .. Believe me.
We'll hafta come back to that one.
Yeah, good question. They don't specify.
Yeah, something could be *done with making these a little bit more specific.
Less ambiguous anyway.
Education? Um, well, okay, so,
we're gonna -
Um -
So, this assumes that we already have a bunch of football equipment, and we're gonna throw it away?
And buy new eq- buy new equipment?
Or is this a committee to oversee the football equipment?
Mm.
Well, see, this is - {VOC breath}
this is a *county.
So that stuff's probably (all) *moldy and -
from the seventies, you know?
It's just *gross! Throw it away!
Yeah, I am saying that.
Cuz I've -
I've used it in um -
I, uh, I actually worked for uh, Multnomah County for awhile. I worked for the uh -
Well, it was for the libraries. Multnomah County Library. At the Hillsdale library!
I worked at the Hillsdale library for three months.
One year.
It was one, one summer.
And, eh - well -
{VOC mouthnoise} Now,
I - I didn't actually play *football, but I mean, I did like P_E_, of course. At - you know, in school. And - And that stuff - Man, that - that -
It's so - You - You don't wanna - It's so *rank. {VOC breath}
You don't wanna *put that stuff on -
Not the football equipment. But I'm talking about the high school now.
No, the high school - This was all Multnomah County stuff, right?
And it said -
So when you got one of those -
I'm talking about more like baseball. Cuz I played baseball, right?
Inside the baseball helmets,
you know? It'd say Multnomah County. It was like, oh man, you wouldn't even wanna put that thing on! It was so gross. It was all -
They never - Well, of course that would be an argument for changing it. But -
I dunno. I - I - They could probably cut all that stuff.
Why -? W- It - It shouldn't be *football equipment, it should be *sports equipment. If it was sports equipment, I would say, yes, keep it.
But it's *just football equipment?
I mean, you know, not everybody plays football. So -
Of course, {VOC breath}
that could bring in big bucks for the - the county, you know. Cuz they got these football teams. They got these like, big football stars, and whatever. And they end up going to the N_F_L_. And they get all these contracts and stuff.
So -
Mm-hm.
Yeah. So maybe we should keep it. We should keep it.
Okay. I'm with you.
Acting coaches. {QUAL muttering}
Well you mean -
the - the acting coaches, like, not the retired ones?
Like, if you think about the football coach,
he's already -
retired.
And these are the actual *acting coaches. You wouldn't wanna get rid of them.
Exactly. Yeah yeah, right, yeah.
Yeah, like the Sandusky guy, or whatever, you know.
Could get rid of the retired coaches.
You know, honestly, I was not a -
*big into poetry.
So.
But I - I shouldn't use that as a basis to - I -
I'm not supposed to be biased, right?
So.
I'll leave that up to you.
E_ -
E_E_ Cummings? Okay. Robert Frost? Okay. Everybody else, forget it.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, you gotta keep them.
Yeah, cuz - {VOC breath}
You know, with our society, we're just gonna need more and more of those, as time goes on, I think.
Cuz they're creating new categories of special ed all the time.
They're subdividing now.
It's - It's a high need.
In fact -
Hey, here's the thing. It's funny because when I - I did my um, my TESOL degree, my - my M_A_ in TESOL here.
And uh, I ended up taking a course in how to teach writing to - Well, they call it learning disabled now. L_D_s.
But it's basically special ed.
And um, well n- {QUAL lengthened} I mean, there is a difference.
But um - And -
And they were saying that, you know, with all the teachers that were being uh -
losing their jobs, and whatever.
*That was the category that everybody was trying to become. Because that's where the jobs are.
So that's like, it's *booming business.
Yeah. That's a huge business now. (That's a) .. *big business.
Yeah.
Well, it's either that or starve to death, right? I mean, geez.
Yeah, that's true. I - I never took a cooking class, and I'm still alive, you know?
Just barely.
But still.
Well, some people gonna need em.
And the thing is, they - they have crossover with like, second-language learners, too.
Yeah.
Well, actually, at this point now -
At this point, that's pretty much what it's gonna be, right?
So then it should be under a different category. It should be under like, uh -
I was gonna say technology. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
I_T_.
Because they're the ones that're actually gonna issue the .. devices, right?
Just gonna stick a computer in your hand and say, here, punch this button, click this.
It's not gonna be any need for a person.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, the bookkeeping, I mean -
You're kind of a branch of that, right?
With auditing?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah, job security. Okay, yeah.
Get it rid of it.
Boom.
Sugar-free juice. But wait a minute. That was gonna go with the whiskey, right?
Yeah, it is.
B_S_.
That's water!
Translation?
H_-two-O_.
And they can just drink outta the f-
They can just drink outta the fountain, right? Yeah. So forget it.
Well, they gotta keep the fountains.
W- They gotta make sure the water fountains are working.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
Yep, there it is again.
Well, that was under public safety in your .. category, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. Mm-hm.
Mm. Mm-hm.
They don't need weed control, do they?
See, here's the thing. It's like,
they need to, um -
What they should have in - in a school, like in the -
They should have the high school kids go out and do like,
you know, one -
They get one credit for community service, right?
Go out, and - Well, yeah. So they've got them to do it. They don't need to have -
Yeah, they don't need to have that *funded, for special people to do that.
Neighborhood watch. Well, I dunno. How dangerous of a place is this?
S- like inner-city Chicago or something?
Well, there's another ambiguity.
Just s- g- you know, m- sell - th-
Isn't there like a G_I_ Joe where they can buy weapons and stuff?
Or like in the South Park episode where Cartman runs around with his pepper spray after he becomes the hall monitor.
Well, they m- they- Okay, so they make him a hall monitor.
Right?
Pr- Pretty simple.
And - And then he gets this thing in his head. He's like, alright, I'm gonna just pepper spray everyone.
And he gets this pepper spray, and he's like,
He's like, where's your hall pass? And the guy doesn't take it out fast enough.
There you go.
Yeah, you just need b-
But I mean, that was -
He was -
just a .. student, right?
He was .. given that responsibility, that was just a natural thing. I mean he wasn't *paid for that. That's not something you hafta pay for.
Yeah. If you're -
Tire irons. Ball peen hammers.
Chains and whips?
Yeah. Well. {QUAL lengthened}
I think they g-
Nah, they're gonna -
It's gonna be -
wherever they happen to feel like it.
They're just gonna dump it anywhere.
Well,
yeah. But still.
Yeah.
I just toss it in the street.
I mean, there's a drain, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I strain it first, but yeah.
That's where I toss my needles, too.
Do you have any cats?
Mm.
Have you spayed em?
Oh, so you had to pay for that?
So then -
Wait a minute.
Ah.
I don't think they paid for anything, right? They just fly around on Lear jets.
Oh my god. Gimme a break. There's - You don't even need - I mean there's like, millions of em, right?
So, why would you need a - ?
I guess you need to have a place to keep them, in order to .. provide them for adoption
But most people just kinda pass em around, don't they?
Isn't that how you got your cat and dog?
You just got em from your neighbors?
Oh really?
Was that useful to you?
But I mean, if they -
If they had not *had that,
wouldn't you've just been able to like, you know, go up to your neighbors and just say, Hey, you got any little puppies in there?
Would that've been a m- major problem, if you hadn't had an adoption service like that, to - to get your
kitten and puppies from?
And that made it easier for you?
Okay, well, we'll keep it then.
Just going to the park, and go
Yeah.
Okay, we'll keep that.
F- Well, food bank and soup kitchens go together, and we hafta have those.
Cuz otherwise, you know, people gonna starve on the street.
Well, we've a- We still got that case of whiskey, right?
And the bagels. .. And the cookies, and the toothpaste.
Yeah.
There's a Whiskey A Go Go.
We don't need a dog catcher.
Cuz we've got the community service, with the baseball bats and -
and the - and the pepper spray, right?
The neighborhood watch. .. The pepper spray.
Oh, I - We can -
We can combine them.
W- Why do they hafta be different? .. It should be the same people.
There you go. Two for one, right?
Just make em work overtime.
I mean, those people -
they just - What do they do most of the time? They just around and like, eat doughnuts in a room or something, right? I mean, they're not working *all the time.
The people who work
in both places.
The, um, the spaying,
the kitty and puppy adoption,
and the, um, and the dog catcher.
They're just spending most of their time sitting around, reading -
magazines and stuff, right? I mean, they can just -
Instead of - It's like,
okay, instead of having this down time,
just go and catch some dogs.
When you're not -
you know, facilitating the adoption of a puppy.
Right. .. Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, they just rotate it, right? ..
It's like, okay, so you'll catch dogs while I -
uh, facilitate the adoption of puppies.
And spay- Yeah. ..
Well, I mean, sp-
How long does it take to spay? ..
It's like five minutes, right? It's like
You know.
I mean -
How long can it take to spay?
Well, yeah, of course. Yeah.
Well, newspaper would work better for that, prolly.
Uh, well, I mean, people already know about that, though, right? We don't need to campaign for it.
People already know that they're sposta bring their bags in - a bag with them in to -
Yeah, we wouldn't - .. we wouldn't need a special campaign for that.
I mean, it's just -
Well, you could bring a politician with you, and he - use his bag.
You mean like a bag of wind.
Well, if we have the {QUAL lengthened} kitten and puppy adoption, then we *hafta have veterinary hospital, right?
Cuz they're gonna get sick, and then there's gonna be lawsuits.
Hm.
Today?
Mm.
Oh.
Mm.
Unless for the stray dogs.
Or the stray *cats.
The stray cats need to be -
Need to have some place to go. .. Right?
Maybe they could do it at the food bank.
Yeah.
Well, as long as they don't label their packages, it should be alright.
I think we could
combine almost all these.
We could combine stray cat spaying, dog catcher, veterinary hospital,
pest control, and um, the food bank.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay. .. Okay.
Well, you gotta have teaching certificates because that's what I have. .. So.
I can't help it. But I have a biased -
a bias -
I'm just too biased.
that would be fine because then, um, I - there would be less competition, for me, for classes.
So if we cut all the cert- the teaching certificates, then I wouldn't hafta compete with other teachers to get classes every quarter.
So yeah, we can go ahead and cut that.
Because currently, I hafta compete with other teachers to get classes.
There'd be fewer teachers certified.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, because they - they change that all the time.
No.
I d- Well,
I mean, I just go the same speed everybody else is going.
But you don't need the signs .. for that.
Well, yeah. I mean, as - as long as you gauge yourself by the traffic. So you don't - either case, you don't need a sign.
Because we got too many signs now anyway.
They're cutting that, anyway.
See, there's the - The things is, they're gonna cut it anyway.
You know they're gonna cut it anyway.
So, there's no point in - in making an effort to keep it.
Yeah, me too.
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, it's an oxymoron. Yeah.
No.
Uh, I don't personally have any tattoos. I don't know about you, but -
Well, you just hafta make sure that you don't get whatever, the hepatitis or something like that.
Yeah.
Mm.
Well, .. I think they have other ways they can get licenses, without having to -
you know, go through a -
a county program.
Well, that's a good question. Uh, is it about safety, or is it about the actual art?
Like the ability to actually draw?
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, but I mean, if it's like, I think they would need a license,
if they were expected to do like a (Rambeau), or like, you know, a nineteenth-century impressionist or romanticist. Th- *Then they would need a license. Otherwise, forget it.
Yeah, y-
If they're just gonna do like, Felix the Cat, forget it. I mean, Jesus. What- You wouldn't need a license for that.
Yeah.
Um. {QUAL lengthened}
Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Uh, y- they're pretty bad. They're pretty bad. Yeah, we need -
We definitely need to do that. Otherwise, the streets are gonna be just -
You won't be able to drive on em at all.
it's hard to say. It's kinda -
A moot point, isn't it?
Yeah, depends on who's hunting who.
I dunno. Is this kind of like a Dick Cheney thing, or - ?
Eh. {QUAL lengthened}
Tags.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, that's a privatized kinda thing, right?
It's been privatized.
It's a good thing they don't have air traffic control in here.
Oh, that's kinda ridiculous, isn't it?
Um. {QUAL lengthened}
Oh, well in my high school, yeah.
Yeah, we definitely needed to have that.
Cuz people would climb up the flagpole all the time. That was a significant form of protest, you know. They climb up the flagpole, and they just sit there, and -
And then s- I mean, that would, like,
cause *stress *fractures in the - in the flagpole.
And then you'd -
you know -
Well, mm-
But then you could have lawsuits, you know. Mm- Don't forget about the lawsuits. You don't want the county to be sued.
Oh, there's another problem.
That's sposta be taxis' tops.
Yeah, there's a lotta problem with taxis' tops. Cuz you know, that's where they put the advertise-
W- Well, that's where they put the advertisements, is on the tops, right?
{VOC mouthnoise} I caught a fish one time in Alaska. I didn't have a license.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
And neighborhood watch.
Oh, I see what you mean. Okay. You- You're misinterpreting that.
Or maybe you were *correctly interpreting it, and I misinterpret it.
Oh, yeah. Okay. Well there's no point. It's a m- Yeah, again, it's another moot point.
Not for *King County. I mean, if - if they mean King County, forget it.
Pierce County, maybe. They're a little bit more conservative, you know? But -
Football stadium upkeep.
Yeah.
Sorry, but -
Yeah.
Well, I mean the kids need to stop throwing their trash all over the place. They just need to have their parents, you know, slap em around a little bit.
Hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Hunting tags.
Well, I mean, as a - To cut?
Uh, okay. Okay. Yeah, we'll toss it out. You know, because, I mean -
The - Those kids, you know, they brought it on themselves.
Honestly.
Speed limit signs.
Yeah, we're -
we're gonna keep teaching certificates, but we're gonna get rid of the speed limit signs.
Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot. Yeah, you're right. Okay, yeah. So, nix the first two.
And the bus stops. And the bus stops.
The first three.
Okay. Let's see.
Yeah.
And tattoos. Yeah. Forget it. Forget it. And boating licenses. .. Right?
Did we say we're gonna -
toss that?
Well, there's so many lakes here, (and) so many boats.
I mean, ts-
place is full of boats. Okay, so we'll keep that.
But the hunting tags, it's gotta go.
Right?
And the towing services.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.
Fine. So.
Um. {QUAL lengthened}
Reusable bags.
Football stadium.
Well, {QUAL lengthened} you said you've got another place to take your cat, right?
So.
Yeah, sure, we could get rid -
Oh really?
Okay.
So you have a public animal, not a private animal?
Ah, okay. Okay. .. Okay, it's been privatized.
So (it's) like a - went through a special operation to get privatized.
Okay. Okay.
Public health?
Uh. Uh.
we needed.
Well.
How many *dog *catchers to you see running around?
Do you ever even see dog catchers?
Hm.
I guess if you've got - You know, you think about all these issues now, with like, pit bulls, chomping people and stuff like that -
Yeah, you're gonna - But they would need - Wouldn't they call that animal control?
Not - .. not .. dog catcher?
Okay. Okay. So we gotta keep that, then?
We do?
Oh yeah, it's the same number from each, right?
Uh. {QUAL lengthened}
Well the thing is, it - it could come back on us.
You know, like,
Ima- You gotta think like, ten or twenty years .. from now, they're gonna have this truth and reconciliation.
And you're gonna hafta *answer for all these *cats that you *spayed.
And it's like, Well I was just doing my job, I - And they're like, Oh, well that's what they said at Auschwitz, you know.
{VOC mouthnoise} So, .. I mean -
Yeah.
Yeah.
Veterinarian, I guess.
It - It depends on my mood.
It d-
It depends on how tired I am.
Uh, I -
Oh -
Actually, it depends on whether or not I'm teaching.
If I'm teaching - And that's changed my speech a lot. .. I'll say veterinarian.
But if I'm just conversation, you know, like with you or something, I say veterinarian.
The only problem is most of the talking I do nowadays is teaching. {QUAL laughing}
So I really hafta think about it.
Uh, yeah I guess I do say veterinarian.
Mm-hm.
Well, nobody gets chicken pox anymore, do they?
Have you given your kid a chicken pox -
vaccination?
Okay, well.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, I could stay home from school, yeah.
Mm.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, they screw everything up. It's a - all kinds of like, uh -
What do they call em? Side effects.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yep.
Um. {QUAL lengthened}
Yeah.
Exactly. Yeah, yeah. And a lotta people don't get that, either, when you start talking about fluoridation of water, and it's like, it's a major thing. Uh -
Well I remember that, too.
I refused to drink it.
Well for a while, I did.
Yeah.
Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. .. Yeah. I went through all that.
Yeah, right. (And -)
I think there's only gonna be more toxic waste. They're gonna need all the disposers they can get.
apps -
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well those are kinda the same anyway, aren't they? Sex offender database and the neighborhood watch support?
Yeah, so you don't need both.
Yeah, exactly.
Plus, nobody uses a watch anymore, (are they), right?
They use -
(Look at their -)
(Use their iPhone.)
You gotta keep it real, right?
Or surreal.
You gotta keep it surreal.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we could have that, too.
Math tutors, forget em.
Forget em. We don't need the - Yeah. We don't need the math tutors or the assistant cooks.
Nope.
Nope.
No acting coaches.
No poetry books.
No cooking classes.
Well, see -
We had all of these things in here that were not - .. we didn't need.
Yeah, that's the problem, is what should we keep?
what should we cut?
We can cut em all.
And sugar-free juice machines. We don't need those.
And bookkeeping classes. Well we do need those.
Uh, oh well, but those don't need support, right? They just kind of exist?
I mean, those are unbreakable.
Those are like Volkswagen Bugs. They never break.
Still drinking the same ones that were
made in World War Two.
Well, I mean, if (they're do) cholera (1x) one person, everybody's gonna get it anyway, so it doesn't matter.
I mean, (a) get -
Y- have a higher risk of getting cholera through bottled water than you do from those -
drinking fountains.
Statistically speaking.
Yeah, because they hafta inspect -
They hafta inspect the - the fountains, you know.
But they don't have to inspect the bottled water cuz that's privatized.
Well, they - they say you can inspect - it's your own -
Mm.
Bottled water.
Yep. .. Resist it.
Mm-hm. See, the water that comes from the taps,
any tap water, that's hasta be inspected.
But I think that's a government (that) does that anyway. Or I mean the - the - like another government, not the county.
Yeah, exactly.
Ah.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay. .. Okay.
Yeah.
Did we hafta write em down or anything?
Okay, cuz I forgot em.
But that prolly wasn't the point anyway.
So I guess we're .. finished?
Alright.
Yes.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Which expensive should be cut from each department, and choose the same number of items from each department.
So. {VOC breath}
Yep.
Yeah.
We must discuss 'each {PRN eess} - each item and reach an agreement about whether to cut it or continue funding it.
I - .. I disagree. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}
Why would anyone wanna be doomed to that .. narrow of a focus in terms of their future career options?
Um.
Um. I'm - I'm gonna disagree with you and say we should keep the math tutors for now.
Just, you know -
because -
What is it? Those who can't teach, teach P_E_? What's the whole -?
Those who can't do math -
Yeah. So, {QUAL lengthened} yeah.
I - .. Assistant cooks?
Really? Why? .. Why would you hang -? {QUAL laughing}
Wait a minute! Why would you hang on to the assistant cooks? {QUAL high pitch}
But that's the thing. Look. {VOC breath} The - You don't need an educational program for assistant cooks.
Cuz you know {QUAL lengthened} that the - if the assistant cook is the .. one on the boat, {VOC breath}
he or she would be the one to survive. Cuz it's always the cook that survives, right? {VOC breath}
So, um, .. I don't think - I don't think they'd -
they need any more help than they're already getting.
Yeah.
They work with large knives. I mean, {VOC start} there's just - You know.
Um. .. Sex ed.
Uh, I -
Yeah.
Well, .. you know.
So.
Ri- Exactly. {QUAL laughing}
Okay.
So, so far, .. I would suggest that assistant cooks may be - .. may be a - .. a program to cut. {VOC breath} Custodians?
What is being in a union shop have to do with that thing?
Well, {VOC start} yeah, but you're - {VOC start} every {VOC start} ..
(Lemme) just .. kinda tell you .. that *everybody in government is gonna *be in the, .. you know,
collectively bargained category. So, .. if - if you've gotta cut people, you're gonna hafta cut people.
{VOC breath} I wouldn't cut the custodians.
Have you ever *seen -
how public officials maintain their offices? Agh! .. (Be - ) You know, .. my seven year old does a better job.
Yeah, (see -)
It's a critical role.
Keep the custodians. Speech therapy.
Speech therapy? {VOC breath}
Yes.
Uh, .. football equipment.
Um, .. no. Why -? Football equipment?
Uh, is that *football football or American football?
Um.
{VOC start} I guess. Or we're - .. still - we're maintaining the equipment? We're buying the equipment?
{VOC breath} {VOC cough} Um.
We must choose the same number -
Which expenses should be cut from each department. We must choose the same number -
So, they're saying, cut the football equipment expenses. So, it leads me to believe there's an ongoing expense that we are now .. not ongoing.
Or, we're *off-going. {VOC mouthnoise}
What (1x)- What are you saying?
(Are you ta-) *I work for the county. What are you saying? You saying that we got moldy football equipment?
Come on, man.
Um.
Oh?
Right.
So the Hillsdale library maintained the moldy football equipment?
I understand.
Yeah.
Right.
Okay.
Well then - But then they'd come back, and they'd be like, I remember when they had to cut the football equipment, so I'm gonna .. spend my -
gazillions on helping out the -
youth football.
No! I think we should .. get rid of it. .. Cut it!
Cut it!
{VOC cough} Um. Acting coaches. .. Clearly .. the most critical role .. in all county services .. are acting coaches.
{VOC laugh} (??) I gotcha. {QUAL laughing}
The - The - Yes.
The - The - {VOC start} Right.
Yeah. {VOC start} Cuz the other coaches are being investigated, or something? Right. The acting .. coaches. .. Um.
Right. {QUAL laughing} Oh, ouch. {VOC breath} Um.
Well in that case, maybe we don't wanna get rid of the .. acting coaches. Uh, poetry books?
Poetry books?
I dunno.
Um.
Uh. {QUAL lengthened} I - I don't know. I think it depends on the poet.
I think we keep the poetry books. How hard can it be to maintain the poetry *books?
Really?
I'm thinking like, .. T_S_ Elliot and stuff. {VOC breath} Um. {VOC breath}
Uh, special ed teachers.
Okay.
Mm. .. Could be true.
Yes. .. {VOC breath} Um.
{VOC start} You - You make it sound like a virus.
Um.
Uh.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well cuz they're -
they're mandated to provide those services.
'Federal. {PRN feder-wall}
Kay, so keep em.
Cooking classes?
Eh. {QUAL lengthened}
Well, no. But why {VOC start} - You know. .. I mean - {VOC start} ..
{VOC start} {VOC start} Can't people take a cooking class at P_C_C_ or something? Why is the county paying for it?
{VOC breath} Well that - that actually says a lot. .. Um.
Uh. {QUAL laughing}
Maybe we don't wanna cut em.
Right. Um. .. {VOC breath} So - .. Note-takers. Disability services?
Do they? Okay. {QUAL yawning} .. I was gonna say, couldn't we just buy everybody {QUAL yawning} an iPad and call it good?
That seems to be the answer.
Public services? .. Infrastructure and licensing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um.
Sugar-free juice machines? I feel like there's a lotta things in this category that are not -
not particularly, um, dynamic. {VOC breath}
Uh. .. Bookkeeping classes, music teachers, .. sugar-free juice machines.
I mean - {VOC start} ..
Based on this list, I - {VOC start} ..
The poor assistant cooks go .. near the top. Football equipment goes near the top. .. For me. .. Like, meaning, get - .. Like we would cut it.
Cooking classes.
'Bookkeeping {PRN book-kee-ke-ming} classes.
Yeah, there's some accounting involved.
So I'd - I'd wanna get rid of the classes so that it would mean, .. you know, {VOC breath} more long-term, like job preservation. (And) people weren't -
{VOC start} Exactly. Exactly. So, you know, yeah. If we - we - That gets cut first.
We need *bad accounting.
Um.
Let's see. {VOC breath}
Well the sugar-free juice machine- That's a little oxymoronic anyway. I mean, .. what is sugar-free juice?
You know. .. I -
I - .. I guess. Um.
{VOC laugh} Pretty much. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} Um.
{VOC start} Yes. .. Uh yes. I think - {VOC start} .. {VOC start} ..
So what they're saying is water fountains. Yes.
Right.
Um.
Okay.
So shall we move to the next category, and then we can kinda come back and keep our numbers? Yes.
Absolutely. I - Don't get rid of the water fountains.
{VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Um.
{VOC mouthnoise} Music teachers. .. Eh.
{VOC breath} Uh, reproductive education. .. {VOC start} .. We should probably hang onto that. ..
Job 'training {PRN traiming} - training programs? Sure.
Chicken pox vaccinations? Sounds good. Invasive species removal?
Um.
Yeah. .. Yep.
S_T_D_ education, toxic waste disposal, hospital additions.
*Bagel .. *factory *inspections.
Absolutely the most critical role that the county can play, is bagel factory inspections.
{VOC breath} Um.
Yeah. .. I think so. Wasn't it?
Was under, um.
{VOC mouthnoise} Was it under public safety? {QUAL muttering} It was under, uh -
Yeah, environmental - .. environmental safety.
{VOC mouthnoise} Um, needle exchange, sex offender database, veterans medical assistance, egg farm regulations, weed control. .. Prenatal check-ups and neighborhood watch support?
Geez! And none of these things I would really get rid of compared about - .. t- .. five or six on the other one. Um.
I think they *do do that now, don't they?
Do the - Do the weed control?
Mm-kay. I'm with you on weed control.
Um. {QUAL yawning}
Um. .. I dunno.
Yeah.
(What - ) Getting rid of neighborhood watch. What could go wrong?
What could go wrong?1
I mean -
That's - {VOC breath} That's what we need. We need everybody to be *armed.
{VOC laugh} Then - Yeah. {QUAL laughing} Then we don't need any regulation. Okay. {VOC breath} .. Oh -
I - I have not seen it. I'm *not {QUAL lengthened} - {VOC start} I've -
Uh-huh. .. And then he starts pepper spraying everybody.
Mm-hm.
There you go. .. Um.
Right.
So, yeah. I think we .. could cut the neighborhood watch support, and instead, just give them all pepper spray and weapons. And - .. Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Pick axes. .. I think, you know -
Um. Pitch forks, torches.
Um. .. Yes. Exact- {QUAL laughing} Oh, my.
Uh, okay.
Toxic waste disposal?
Now see here's my question. If we cut the toxic waste disposal program,
does that mean that people will dispose of their toxic waste in another county?
So why don't - Let's just do that, and then they'll take it all to Pierce County.
Wasn't that what you do now?
You know, and I've used motor oil. I just kind of, {VOC mouthnoise} you know, spread it around in my back yard.
Yeah.
Especially, you know -
{VOC breath} I just look for those drains that are stenciled with the salmon .. pictures and .. make sure that I put em down there. Cuz I figure it's good for the salmon. {QUAL muttering}
Right, right.
Um.
Okay.
Um. {QUAL laughing} .. Recreation and public services. Stray cat *spaying, public news *station, food bank, junior -
Uh, I do. I have cats - .. I have a cat and a dog. .. Living together. Mass hysteria. {VOC breath} Um.
Um, have I *spayed them?
Personally? No. {QUAL laughing} .. I have had them fixed. Yes.
I did.
Ha- Okay. Stray cat spaying it is. Although, you know, we're gonna have a whole lot of stray cats.
Stray Cats paying, yes. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath}
{VOC start} Their last album. Which was a flop. {NVC} I - I have no idea. Stray cat -
spaying. {VOC breath}
Kitten and puppy adoption?
Kitten and -
No, I - I got them from kitten and puppy adoption.
Yeah, I really did.
Uh, soup kitchens.
The kitten and puppy adoptions services?
Um.
That's distinctly possible. .. But, {VOC start} you know, it's not - We're - we're -
We're - .. Uh, yeah.
I th- I think the difference would be that because there was a kitten-puppy adoption service,
that there was somebody to facilitate the adopting of the kitten and-or puppy.
Yes, absolutely.
Um. .. You know, I mean, you could always go with the, uh -
I don't know. Most of the world -
Greece -
Thailand .. slash approach, where could just have the dogs and the cats running around doing everything.
{VOC breath} Yeah. {VOC start} Um. .. But I - I - I don't know. .. You know.
Might be a little cold. {VOC breath} Alright. {VOC breath}
Soup kitchens, housing assistance.
What if they wanna eat something besides soup, though?
Could we have like a *salad kitchen?
(2x) we do. {QUAL laughing} We could have like a *vegan - {VOC breath}
Yes.
We could have a *whiskey kitchen.
Really? Actually, isn't there a wester- restaurant called that, or something? {QUAL muttering} {VOC breath}
Okay. Housing assistance.
Um. .. Dog catcher.
How - How we gonna have kittens and puppies to - ? {NVC}
W- Well what are they gonna do when they get the dog? {QUAL laughing}
I - I'm just worried about the kitten and puppy adoption service, if they don't have a dog catcher to catch the kittens and puppies to be adopted. ..
Maybe we need a *cat catcher in there. {VOC breath}
There is no cat catcher!
Holy -
The dog catch- {VOC start} .. Okay.
Dog catcher and stray cat spaying. .. Yes.
The boys basketball club?
Who?
Mm-hm.
{VOC breath} I think that's - I actually think - As a county employee, I think that's a brilliant idea. What they should do is -
They should take m- force me to take my lunch hour, and just reassign everybody who does all these other public functions {VOC breath} to go do dog catching.
You know, .. for an hour or two. .. Uh, every week. Yeah, okay. .. Yeah.
Yep.
(1x) spay-
And - And spay stray cats. Okay. {VOC mouthnoise} .. {VOC cough}
I have no idea. {NVC} .. Yeah. .. You know. .. Just -
W- Tha- But that's what you need the scissors and the case of whiskey for.
Um.
The loose-leaf paper? I don't know. {VOC breath} Uh.
Reusable bag campaign.
Reusable bag campaign. {QUAL muttering}
Well, I was gonna say. I mean. (Yeah) {VOC start} (2x) ..
I - I know. {VOC start} ..
(2x) I don't know why you'd need a special - {NVC}
We re-elect most of the politicians around here anyway. .. So.
Well that's what I'm saying. (1x) reusable bag. .. Um.
Uh.
I - I work with a lotta these people. I hafta be careful. {VOC breath} Um. {QUAL laughing}
So, uh, veterinary hospital.
What do we do with (veterinary hos-)? {QUAL muttering}
Um.
No, I'm - In all seriousness, I had to take my dog -
uh -
in today.
You know.
Yes. .. He's - He's old. He's like thirteen.
{VOC breath} So - .. I - .. I'm not taking my dog to a county hospital. I'm taking my dog to the, .. you know -
the West Seattle Vet. .. So, {VOC breath}
I don't know that the county needs to pay for .. veterinary hospitals. Like -
Yeah. .. Um.
I (spo-)
Well, b- yeah, but you could pay - {QUAL lengthened} I mean, if you have - if you have a program for stray cat spaying.
They could do that at someone else's, .. you know, vet hospital. They could do that -
I don't know. .. I just don't know that the county needs to pay for that. ..
They could do it at the food ban- That is a great idea.
Wow. I really don't wanna be going to the food bank any time soon. That's terrible, Pete! {QUAL laughing}
Oh, jiminy Christmas. That's just terrible.
Um. .. The football stadium upkeep.
And the soup kitchens.
Yes. .. Okay.
Uh, so -
W- Okay, we're gonna hafta come back and .. figure out what we're cutting. But I think we have a good sense of what it is that we would cut in that category.
Starting with the -
veterinarian.
Infrastructure and licensing.
Li- Like I said, we can cut that immediately. {QUAL laughing}
Um.
Why?
(n- dat) Oh. So you're saying that if there were no more teaching certificates, you would be - you would be the only - .. (1x)
Okay, well then let's cut that program.
Uh, speed limit signs?
I - I don't pay - Personally, I don't pay attention to the speed limit. .. Do you?
Yeah. Okay. .. Then we should be (gold-)
Oh, do you?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Kay.
Right. .. Uh, additional bus stops?
No.
No. We don't need - .. We don't need any additional bus stops.
Yeah.
Well they just spent - You know, I mean - It's - I don't know about you, but I - I do ride the bus. And there's - they have the Rapid Ride lines.
Which I think is funny, because a ride implies that you can sit down, right? And so, Rapid Ride, it's neither rapid nor a ride. {VOC breath} Right? {VOC breath}
Um. .. So no additional bus stops.
Uh. .. Tattoo artist licenses?
Do - D- I do. We - We don't - We don't need to talk about that. {QUAL whispering}
Um.
So, uh, but tattoo - Why -
You're going to a tattoo artist. Do you think that they're going to be licensed? ..
Is that really a .. reasonable expectation?
I thought that was - I thought that was - they put that -
You know, (there) was like, hey, you got that for free. .. You know?
Normally it's ten dollars extra, but today, we'll make sure that you only get hep B_.
Um.
Okay.
Yeah.
Is it in - Is it a license for like, how good of a tattoo artist they are, or, you know - ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought maybe, you know, it's like, oh, I've -
I've actually done *seventeen scorpions tattoos, and so you get some sort of special -
Yeah, okay. Yeah.
Right, exactly. {QUAL laughing}
Some - Some sort of phenomenal Maxfield Parrish reproduction.
Right.
Right.
A- Another Kid Rock.
Uh, okay.
Um.
Boating licenses.
Do we really need people to have a license when they go boating?
I mean,
what could go wrong?
You know?
Uh, .. pothole maintenance?
Um.
{VOC mouthnoise} (I dunno.)
(Wait,) how do you feel about -
Mm-kay.
Subway system?
The- It would be nice to have one. .. But since we don't, I don't think we need - I don't think we need .. the program for it.
Um.
Is that like a tag for hunters?
Yeah. .. Um.
I don't know. Is like, what do you do? Do you like, run up and tag somebody as they're hunting, and say, you're it? I -
Um.
uh, .. they were a number of other towing services that seemed to do a pretty decent job of that, at absolutely inopportune times.
Yeah.
Um.
Uh -
Massage cert- Massage certificates?
Yeah.
Is that like a cert- Do they give you a certificate .. suitable for framing after you had a massage? Is that what -? I don't -
Do they mean like a certification?
Message certificates, yes. {QUAL laughing}
You've got mail.
Um.
Flagpole repair? I don't think we need to repair any flagpoles. Taxi stops?
Problem solved!
Yeah. Taxi stops?
(Well -)
I - Can't you just stop a taxi by going out and whistling or waving, or - ?
Yeah.
So, taxi stops.
Fishing licenses.
Definitely a vitally important .. thing.
Public b-
Public bus upkeep. Well they're not really doing it now. .. So, um -
And drainage ditches.
Alright, so - What do we - Let's - Why don't we pick one from each category to cut, and then maybe pick another - Let's just do it.
Across the board. .. So -
Education programs? Do you wanna cut assistant cooks?
Kay.
Public health and safety?
Uh, weed control?
I mean, it - it is legal now.
Yeah. .. So -
Yes.
No, that's what I'm saying. It's legal now. So why'd (you) - Why - What's - Why do you need to control it?
Right. Um.
Uh.
The recreation and public services. Do we - Did we say we were getting rid of the -
veterinary hospital? What are we doing?
Um.
Football stadium upkeep. I'm with you. .. Okay.
Hunting tags?
D- You're - You're - You're not going with flagpole repair? .. That's a critical category for you, isn't it? You -
I -
Kay.
The - Yes, the f- the -
No weed control.
No assistant cooks. So let's go back the other direction then.
Um.
Uh, are we getting rid of teaching certificates? .. Speed limit signs.
I thought if we got rid of the teaching certificates, you got -
You were -
Okay. .. So, okay, w-
Okay. We'll nix the first three.
Kay. .. One, two, three.
Kay. Can we get three out of every - ? Then we'd have four in every category. I think that's pretty good.
So no teaching certificates, no speed limit signs. Who needs speed limit signs? Additional bus stops,
and tattoo artist licenses. .. Okay.
Well, you know -
It's kind of like a driver's license. Like, you know.
Right.
We could w-
But d- but see -
This is what concerns me. .. Is w- if we got like five things in this category, I dunno that we can get five out of every other category.
So let's go with those three for now.
Um.
Football stadium.
Well, we already got rid of the football stadium upkeep.
So, reusable bags, .. veterinary hospital, yes, no?
Yes, no?
Yeah, but that - W- I try not to - That's a - We don't talk about that in public. {QUAL whispering}
Yes. Uh. {QUAL laughing}
No, that's - Well,
it's my own.
Yeah.
Um.
We're getting rid of the veterinarian, we're getting rid of the .. reusable bag campaign -
and we're getting rid of what?
Pest control?
Um.
The dog catcher?
Pest control.
They do exist.
They are there. There's like all the .. all the cities in King County pay for a couple of em.
Kay. .. So we need one more.
Yeah. Cuz we've -
Yeah.
So, .. stray cat spaying.
Y- You're right. Y- .. You're right. .. You're right.
Plus the - Oh, man. Oh, god.
Um.
That's one for you. Do you pronounce that veterinarian or 'veterinarian? {PRN vet'rinarian}
I think it does, too.
Um.
Uh-huh.
I think I say veterinarian.
Yeah.
Um, okay.
So we got four in that category.
Public health and safety.
Vaccination?
Actually, yeah, it's kind of - It's par for the course now.
But that's the thing, is,
you don't run around and do it t- I think they should get - I think you're right. They should cut that program.
Somebod- Some- Somebody on the block had chicken pox,
*all the kids went over to their house and played with em and did all that stuff, so that the kids would all catch chicken pox and .. have it when they were young.
Yeah. So, you know.
Besides, y- I - I think that .. vaccinations - I don't - I - they just -
lead to all kinds of crazy things. You know. Um.
Fluoridation of water, and -
So, uh, yeah. No vaccinations whatsoever.
Um.
Can we - Can we ban all vaccinations? Is that .. a .. possibility in this category, or - ?
I think we can only do that if we live in Portland. ..
I -
I'm - I'm being very, very sarcastic.
When you were - When you were - ? I remember we usta hafta swish with the little fluoride cups. Yeah. .. Oh, I did it.
I'm - I'm uh, .. How do I put it?
I'm - I'm jaded in the sense that I'm - I'm old, and I'm like, of course you wanna fluoridate your water. Like, what is wrong with you .. people? But then I remember where I came from, and that's of course why.
Um, you know, it's a Portlandia kinda moment.
Um.
Okay.
Uh, what else?
Did we - Were we keeping or getting rid of toxic waste disposal?
Bagel factory inspections were out.
Okay. So we got bagel factory inspections, we got -
chicken pox vaccinations. We already got rid of weed control. So we need one more.
Who needs a sex offender database, really? I mean - {QUAL laughing}
Wha-
You know.
Um.
Oh, neighborhood watch support. That was the other one we were getting rid of.
So we still have the database.
That's good. .. Um.
That work for you?
So we've got - .. We've got those three. Sn-
that I have not experienced in .. maybe my entire life. It's - It's - .. Yes.
Yes.
Uh yes. .. Um. .. I thought you were saying cereal. You know, like, pun after pun after pun after pun.
So what do we have left? We already got rid of the assistant ca - cooks.
No football equipment.
Right? .. So we need one more.
What!
No! It - Acting coaches and poetry books are critical. .. Cooking classes.
I know. And now we hafta keep a lot of them. So -
No, we decided we wanted the sugar-free juice machines because when we thought through it, it meant that they were all water fountains.
I dunno. .. I'm - you know. Unless you wanna -
is a *cholera outbreak on the county's dime. So I think we keep those. Let's get rid of the cooking classes.
Kay.
Ah, I thought you had a higher risk of getting cholera .. central London.
Mm.
Good -
*That's where I caught cholera! I - See?
Yes.
Kay.
I - I'll keep that in mind. .. Um.
Yeah.
Yeah. .. I think the E_P_A_ does it.
But now, it's not being inspected anymore, since we are - ..
I - I don't know.
Um.
I don't think it was, either.
Are - Are we?
Well, I think .. this clearly should be f- the food aisles, right? {VOC mouthnoise} Are we doing - There's an aisle on either side, right?
Yeah.
Okay. So then, .. does this look like outdoor .. slash, like home improvement-y type stuff? {VOC breath} And then - {VOC breath}
Paper, miscellaneous, {QUAL lengthened} other things?
Okay.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Let's - {VOC mouthnoise}
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay. Scissors? {VOC breath}
I feel like, in this one?
{NVC} Um -
Yeah. You want this to be, like, household? {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} We *are gonna need to put clothes somewhere. Do we wanna decide - ? That's a big category that we don't have represented on here. {VOC breath}
'You {PRN nyou} wanna do em, like, here?
Okay. {VOC breath} So scissors, how bout by toilet paper?
{VOC breath} Maybe, like, by the power cords? {VOC breath}
Mm-hm. {VOC mouthnoise}
Okay. So, maybe just fill in this area right here? {VOC breath}
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Cases of whiskey!
Maybe at the end of the food aisle? {VOC breath}
{NVC} I'm trying really hard to avoid that noise. {VOC breath} {VOC laugh} Okay, pre-cut wood. {VOC breath}
Mm-hm.
You wanna do, like -
more outdoors slash home improvement?
Up here?
What do you think? Next to it, or - ? {VOC breath} .. Kay.
{VOC laugh} How bout mint toothpaste? {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, I would agree with that. {VOC breath}
Sticks of butter.
By the eggs?
Mm-hm. {VOC breath}
Oh, that does make sense that this stuff is refrigerated. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, do they mean like - ? {QUAL laughing} It probably doesn't - {QUAL laughing} I would say by the power cords. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Maybe in here somewhere?
That works. {NVC}
Bars of soap. {NVC} With this other bathroom stuff right here? {VOC breath} {NVC}
And then liters of water? Maybe by the whiskey? {VOC breath} {NVC}
Maybe by the cake mix? {VOC mouthnoise}
Large cups. {VOC breath}
This might be, like, a miscellaneous non-food.
Right here?
Yeah.
I have a small axes. Maybe with the wood?
{VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Mm. {VOC breath} Yeah.
Yeah, I think in there, probably.
Yeah. Sure.
{VOC breath} {NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} Face cream. More bathroom stuff?
(Right here)?
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah. That makes sense to me. {VOC breath}
Yeah. Yeah.
Definitely.
Thick sweaters.
{NVC} With the clothes? Where's the - ? Yeah. {VOC laugh} The heavy coats. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} And then, dried figs. {VOC breath} (1x) see, do we have anything else like that? This stuff is all dry.
Yeah. That makes sense to me.
Maybe next to the doughnuts?
No {QUAL laughing} it's fine.
Uh, anywhere in here would make sense to me. Maybe down here?
I- is there - w- 'was {PRN dwas} there more bread stuff? Do you remember?
We could do, like, under the soybeans.
{VOC breath} Now do you wanna do with clothes or over here? I'd say by the boating supplies. Yeah.
Backpacks. {NVC} {VOC breath}
With the travel guides. {VOC laugh}
Yeah.
Hats.
(Want) do with this stuff?
Thick sweaters.
Small saws. {VOC breath} There was another saw, right?
I don't think that spot is meant for something this {QUAL laughing} big. {VOC breath} Uh -
You think I can stick it there? {VOC breath}
Oh yeah. .. Okay.
Do that.
Like a box cutter? {VOC breath} ..
Yeah.
Maybe with the duct tape and the power cords.
Oh yeah, and the mousetraps.
{VOC breath} Yeah. {VOC breath} 'Let's see. {PRN let'th thee}
I think definitely somewhere over here.
What about in there?
Large 'vests. {PRN vessss} {NVC}
Okay.
Bottles of juice? Down here?
Buckets. {VOC breath}
Mm-mm.
What about with this stuff?
Just, like, miscellaneous house stuff?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's good.
We did.
Put it on the other side of egg timers? {VOC laugh}
Perfect.
{NVC} Pouches of oatmeal.
I think by the figs.
Or here.
Let's see. Five-pound weights. {NVC}
{VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
Yeah. Like here.
Yeah. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
{VOC mouthnoise} Uh -
We don't really have, like, a gardening -
I'd say somewhere here.
Light jackets.
Yeah.
Yeah.
{NVC} Okay.
Chocolate bars. {NVC}
Probably by the sugar.
Or maybe here.
Yeah. {NVC} {VOC breath}
Perfect.
(1x) where 'did {PRN wdid} our buckets go?
Yeah, maybe down here?
Books of matches.
{VOC mouthnoise} I think, yeah.
Perfect.
Mm-hm.
We have cans of peas.
Maybe {QUAL lengthened} .. here?
Yeah.
{VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} I think we ended up using up - But maybe go on the other side of the toys?
{NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} Beets.  {NVC} {NVC}
What do you think, somewhere over here? {VOC breath} .. Since we have all this space for food? {NVC}
{VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Um -
{NVC} {VOC breath} Yes, I'm sort of - .. Yeah, over there. .. Maybe.
{NVC} By the jugs or something? {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath}
{NVC} {VOC breath} We made fun of their organization, but I don't know that we're doing any better. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Books by travel guides?
{NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} Tow ropes. .. Boating supplies. {VOC breath} {NVC}
Yeah. {VOC breath}
{VOC laugh} There's a lot of empty space over here. {VOC breath} Okay. We're done, I think. {VOC breath}
Okay. {NVC}
Food aisle, probably.
I thi- I think so, cuz it looks like there's a lot in there, and I don't think we could .. fit them on -
the same .. side.
{VOC mouthnoise} This is, like, the outdoor - Yes.
And -
Yeah, that sounds - that sounds good. {VOC breath}
Let's see what they - {VOC breath}
Yeah, that sounds - {NVC}
Second .. aisle -
If I remember right, we had more, like, outdoorsy words? So second - {VOC breath} Yeah, so like s- second -
{VOC breath} Oh, yeah.
Where do (we) want the clothes?
{VOC breath} We could do them there, that's a big - {VOC breath}
Toilet paper. I would say that sounds good. {VOC breath} .. Rolls of duct tape. Do you think that's, like, outdoor, or inside?
Power cor- power cords?
If I was looking for a power cord I might also l- be looking for duct tape. {VOC breath} .. Yep, heavy coats.
Like, start with toys?
Where should we put {QUAL laughing} our alcohol? {VOC breath}
I know, avoid that {VOC mouthnoise}. {PRN /kx/}
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} That's probably -
out- 'Did we {PRN dwee} say outdoors were in aisle one?
Yeah, I'm say, cuz boating - {VOC breath} Yeah, so boating supplies - I- tha- f- pre-cut wood's probably more - .. Yeah, like .. outdoor - {VOC breath} Wherever.
That looks good. {VOC breath}
Mi- That's .. probably -
Th- household? Like, toilet, by - {VOC start} Kinda by toilet paper, maybe?
Sure, that's refrigerated, right? {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
Um, heavy cable.
Out .. door? Or is that home improvement? I don't even know what a heavy cable is. {VOC breath} Do they mean, like, towing rope?
Power cords. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} And then electric heaters.
Eh {QUAL nasalized}, I'll put it next to the siding.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, probably.
{VOC mouthnoise} That sounds good.
Gotta get your water and your whiskey at the same time.
Boxes of doughnuts. {VOC breath}
Cake mix.
Hm.
{VOC start} Yeah, just stick it - Yeah, just go ahea- Stick it with the pet food. Yeah. I feel like when I go into, like, Walmart or Target it's, like, pet food, like -
random stuff, and then everything else.
{VOC mouthnoise} Probably with the wood if you're .. gonna cut .. wood.
{VOC breath} Might need an ax. {VOC breath} Shoelaces. {VOC breath} Too bad we don't have shoes, cuz then we would put them next to them. But I think - Were we doing - ? {VOC breath} Here?
Or should I start at the bottom, so we can put maybe shoes there? (1x). {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Probably more bathroom.
Yeah. {VOC breath}
Oh, our egg timers. Those are random. {QUAL muttering} Maybe by refrigerator magnets! That seems like {VOC breath} it would be -
And then fish hooks. .. Do you wanna stick em .. up by our - {VOC breath} Like, I don't know - If you go boating you might need a f- fish hook.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Closing. .. Closing, I can't even speak. Clothing. {VOC breath}
Like, dried - Yeah d- put it with the dry stuff. {VOC breath}
{NVC} {VOC breath} 'Fleece {QUAL lengthened f} lined boots. Maybe by the shoelaces? {QUAL unsure} {VOC breath}
Packages of cookies. Doughnuts.
Sorry, I grabbed a lot. {VOC breath} 'Bagels. {PRN baggles}
I don't remember.
Soybeans.
{VOC breath} Wetsuits. {VOC breath}
I'd say over here, (2x) - I would say over by the boating supplies.
{VOC breath} That could go -
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} (I would say) it could go with travel guides. {VOC breath} I mean, that's kinda the, like, outdoorsy aisle.
'Hats. {QUAL lengthened s}
{VOC mouthnoise} Stick it with the - Yeah, stick it with the - {NVC}
Yeah, there was an ax. There was a small ax. {NVC}
Well, you could stick it across cuz we have the both, uh - I think we have both sides of the aisle.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Box knives. I wonder if they're talking about kitchen knives, or - ?
Yeah, like a box .. knife.
Ye- probably you're right, it's probably, like, a box cutter, cuz it would be box *of knives. {VOC breath}
Where should we stick it?
{VOC start} Duct tape, power c- yeah, that sounds like a-
That's outdoor? I don't know, it's kinda random.
I say b- it's be somewhere over here. That's where I would put it too.
'Electric {PRN lectric} heaters, sure.
Cushions for deck chairs. {VOC breath} {NVC}
Mm, probably with our clothes? {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} Yeah, (I'd) stick it with .. b- our box stuff.
Buckets. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}
{VOC mouthnoise} We don't seem to have cleaning supplies. {VOC breath}
Mousetraps, box knives, buckets, yeah.
{VOC breath} Loose-leaf paper.
That's like - We have scissors!
{VOC breath} Tweezers. Bathroom - {VOC breath}
Well, {QUAL lengthened} we kinda used up our bathroom space. {VOC breath} I wonder if we could just -
s- put it on th- Yeah, 'that's what {PRN st} I was just gonna say. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} If we have more bathroom stuff, .. (we) can put it there. And then bucket - I can't read - *bundles of sticks. {VOC breath} 'Let's {PRN s} put it up here with the pre-cut wood. {QUAL muttering} {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, by the figs. It's all dry. {VOC breath}
Sure! Put it .. between the cookies and the sugar. {VOC breath}
I would put it maybe over -
I feel like, on this - ?
Our random -
Yeah. {NVC}
Light {QUAL whispering} jacket.
They could fit there.
Either or. {NVC}
{VOC mouthnoise} Fishing net.
Fish hooks? F-
{VOC breath} Empty plastic jugs.
Our 'buckets {PRN bucketsss} were right 'here {PRN here-ere} Stick wi- by the peat moss.
Bundle - By bundles of sticks?
Gas-powered cookstoves. Maybe -
by the books of matches or the boating supplies?
(1x) maybe we'll stick it there.
Yes. Sure. Next to soybeans. That makes sense. {VOC breath}
Socks. {VOC breath} Where -
our are -
Where {VOC breath} are - Eh. {VOC breath} I think we ended up using all of our - Above toys, yeah.
{VOC breath} {VOC breath} Beets. {NVC}
Since we - Might as well, since we have all this space for food.
So somewhere over here.
{VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} I know. I know. I don't know if ours is any {QUAL laughing} better. {VOC laugh}
Yeah, that sounds l- logical.
{VOC breath} And .. our tow rope. Last one. Boating supplies.
I think that's a little better.
I mean, this is a little confusing, but that's okay. {QUAL whispering} {NVC}
{VOC breath} I know.
This is gonna be more, like, ideological. {VOC breath} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Okay, let's look at these.
Mm-hm. I think we should read through the whole list.
Mm-hm. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}
Mm-hm. {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath}
{NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} Okay. {VOC breath} {NVC} {VOC breath} {NVC}
Yeah, I looked at em all. I think the sugar-free juice machines. .. Cuz they can bring it from home!
{VOC breath} Yeah. {VOC breath} .. Um, do we wanna do one from each category? {VOC start} You wanna do one from each and then -
maybe more?
Mm-kay.
So definitely sugar-free juice machines. {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Oh, okay. {VOC breath} .. Okay. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath}
I think that's important. {VOC breath} .. People need extra help.
Particularly with math. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} I agree. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}
D- depends on how b- large of .. a school, too. It could, one -
Then definitely. {NVC} {NVC}
{NVC} I think it's important, too.
Mine neither. {VOC breath}
Yeah, I think it's important for public health, too, if you wanna keep, like, teenage pregnancies down. {VOC breath} Okay, so we'll keep that for sure. Custodians, clearly important. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} {VOC start}
Speech therapy?
Mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
Maybe that could be outsourced, too. {NVC}
{VOC breath} I think .. y- we have to remember that the - the extra-curricular stuff is important. Like, I would definitely not wanna get rid of the poetry or the cooking class, so we probably gotta keep the football equipment for .. that kinda kid. {VOC laugh} Right? {VOC laugh}
{VOC breath} Okay. {VOC breath} Um -
Acting coaches. 'Similarly, {QUAL lengthened /s/} the arts, probably kind of important.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
Individual.
I agree.
{VOC mouthnoise} I completely agree.
You're right. .. I didn't think about it that way, so.
{NVC} Yeah. {VOC breath}
Yeah. 'Think {PRN hink} we should keep that.
Yeah. Wh- {VOC laugh} that's already funded, right? {QUAL laughing}
{VOC breath} Special ed teachers, I think that's really important.
People don't know how to take care of themselves. I think that's really important. {VOC breath}
Yeah. {VOC breath}
That's required by law to be available, so we gotta keep that. {VOC breath}
Cut that.
I think that's another thing we could get rid of.
That's really specific. {VOC breath}
Um, music teachers. I think that's really important.
Okay. {VOC breath}
Yeah. And I think we could go back if we wanted to and get rid of (1x) right there. Okay. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}
That's like sex ed, but for adults, right?
I think that's important.
I think that's also really important.
It probably depends on whether you're old. .. I think.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm. {VOC breath}
I have the same feeling about that one. It could go, maybe. {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
I think that's important.
Invasive species removal? I think we could get rid of weed an- weed control.
If it's about being pretty, rather than, like, destroying the - the area.
To get rid of? {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath}
{VOC start} Should keep that, yeah.
They could go together.
Mm-hm. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}
Clearly.
{VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Hospital additions.
Mm-hm. {VOC breath}
{NVC} Yeah.
If it's a time of cuts, it might not be time to make an addition, too. {VOC breath}
Yeah.
Me too.
That seems .. important. .. Yeah. {QUAL laughing}
{VOC mouthnoise} Definitely.
Yeah, you can't get rid of that.
We'll cut that one. .. I think that's gonna be our one.
{VOC breath} Gotta keep that. {VOC breath}
Neighborhood watch support?
I don't feel that -
importantly about that one.
That could be, like, the next on the list to go. {VOC breath}
Stray cat spaying. Keep it, otherwise the cat .. population just explodes. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Is that, like, classifieds?
Mm-hm. {VOC breath}
{NVC} Yeah, maybe it's, like, postings about things that are going on in the community?
Considering the category.
That's - I mean, it's - .. Tha- that would be important as far as, like, keeping a community feeling like a com- community. But, uh - {VOC breath}
Mm-hm. {VOC breath}
County. That's a whole county.
{VOC breath} I think it could be low on the priority list, but probably we'd like to keep it.
Food bank k- (2x) Very, yeah.
That's, like .. not in addition - That's, like, in addition to what's in the schools, right?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm. {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath}
Yeah. .. Yeah.
Otherwise they're gonna get euthanized, right?
Oh my god! {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} I can't have that happen on my watch. {VOC breath} {VOC laugh}
{VOC breath} Okay. .. Soup kitchens, obviously. Have to keep that. {VOC breath}
Really important.
Is that even something that still exists?
I don't know if it's high priority. If you're looking at, like, cutting a food bank or cutting a dog catcher.
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Oh, you've never seen that? They're - it's a station where .. pretty much anybody can have a show. {VOC breath}
{NVC} Any kind of show. Yeah, it's on T_V_. {VOC breath}
It's usually very weird. {VOC laugh}
Like Wayne's World, actually. That - that whole idea behind that, yeah. On T_V_. {VOC breath} {NVC} {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
*I think that could be towards the bottom of the priority list, though.
Or public access. {QUAL laughing} Yeah. I would cut that before I would cut the dog catcher, too. {VOC breath}
{NVC} I agree.
Mm-hm. Then it's important. Yeah.
Yeah. {NVC} {VOC breath} Well, I mean, if we're not gonna - They have to upkeep it if it's gonna get used. Right? {NVC} {VOC breath}
How bout pest control? Clearly. I mean, we can't have, like, county .. property that's covered in -
bugs or mice.
So, out of that list - ?
Access - public access station, {QUAL laughing} I think. {VOC breath}
Or -
Could the public 'access {PRN 'assess} station show the news ads - ?
And get rid of the news ads.
Yeah, I w- f- feeling it would be in th- the back of something, like a - like a Stranger, or something like that?
Let's get rid of the -
the news ads and keep the station. .. And then they can have, like, a .. thing where they show the news. {VOC breath} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Okay. {VOC breath} {VOC breath} Teaching certificates. {VOC breath} Gonna stay. .. Yeah.
Absolutely has to {QUAL laughing} stay. Yes.
Mm-hm.
{VOC breath}  The one thing I was thinking of is if you gotta choose between bu- additional bus stops or *taxi stops. {VOC breath} Taxis are a - a private thing. Yeah. {NVC}
I would keep the bus stops. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}
{VOC breath} Mm-hm. {VOC breath}
Regulation of that? Yeah, definitely. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} If you're near water. .. Yeah.
Well I think if you cut those thing, people are just gonna do it without. {NVC} {VOC breath}
Pothole maintenance. .. Gotta - gotta keep that.
Right, cuz people can't drive on the s- on the streets. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} Subway system.
Is it already existing? I would assume.
Yeah.
I don't either.
Um. .. Is that, like - I'm assuming, the same as a license? {NVC}
Mm-hm.
{NVC} So it's not just everybody going for it. {VOC breath}
Yeah, cuz then y- what if you have, like, a - ?
Mm. Well, I'm thinking -
It's probably not as important, as far as, like, uh -
punishing people for parking in the wrong spot, but what if you have, like a broken down car in downtown forever? You wanna get that outta there. {VOC breath}
Yeah.
I mean, I just keep thinking we're only gonna have to get rid of one .. outta here. .. And I think taxi stops are it.
Okay. And then, just to talk about the last three. {VOC breath} Fishing licenses, again, we wanna regulate it.
Very important.
Also. {VOC breath} Yeah, things can flood. {NVC}
{VOC mouthnoise} Oh, yeah.
{NVC} Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah. .. {VOC breath}
Okay, we're done.
Okay. {VOC breath}
I know. {VOC breath} {NVC}
So, education programs. Why don't we - ?
Yeah, let's - And then why don't we read through, like, the whole list -
first? Do you think?
And then maybe .. {QUAL lengthened} come up with, like -
the one that you would - {VOC start}
like -
If you re- like, if you put them in, like .. most important to, like, least important. {VOC breath}
Like, in your head. I don't know. {NVC}
I - {VOC start} I would p-
Did you (1x) - did you finish?
{VOC breath} Um -
I was just gonna say the sugar-free juice machine! {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} Yeah, you could - They don't need juice, you could just drink water. That's what I would cut too. {VOC breath} .. Um -
Yeah, I wonder - Yeah, we could probably maybe - {VOC start} {VOC breath}
{VOC start} Why don't we .. like, cut .. one, and then if we need to go back an-
cut more. So - Below are departments that are (??) {QUAL muttering} {VOC breath} Decide which (expense) (??) you must choose the same number of items from each department. {VOC breath}
Oh, we 'must {PRN mut} discuss each item. Okay. .. Okay. {VOC breath} Okay, just kidding. So, {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} {VOC start} math tutors.
I think that's important.
Yes. Um -
{VOC breath} Assistant cooks -
I would .. personally probably put on the, like, not *quite as important. {VOC breath} But -
Um -
{VOC mouthnoise} I don't know. {VOC breath}
A school, right? I mean, if there's, like, a thousand kids, like -
two cooks, we'd probably need more. But, .. {VOC breath} um - .. Sex ed. I feel like sex ed's important. I think it's really important for .. people. I don't know, my school district didn't do a lot of sex ed education, and {VOC breath} it's, like, that's *kind of important, and it's kind of just biology, so you c- should -
Yeah. .. {VOC breath} 'Yes, {PRN yeah-ss} down. {VOC breath} Um - {VOC mouthnoise}
Yeah, they're important. {VOC breath} Um. .. {VOC mouthnoise} Speech therapy .. can be important - {VOC breath} {VOC laugh} being *in speech - like, if somebody's in, like the speech department - {VOC breath} I - it also is - only serves a select -
population. .. {VOC breath} and so, like, if I *personally was on a budget committee I would *probably look to see what -
I don't know, like - {VOC mouthnoise}
Yeah, th- yeah. That's what I m- mean, I guess. {VOC breath} Football equipment.
Is important. Yeah.
'Cooking {PRN cookn} classes, yeah.
For th- Equally.
Yeah.
Acting coaches?
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah. {QUAL breathy} The only thing about acting coaches - If it said, like, drama teacher, I would say no no no, keep it. {VOC breath} But, like, for me, when I see the word *coach, I think of, like -
like - yeah, like, an individualized thing. And so I wouldn't want to cut .. like, a drama department. {VOC breath} But .. if it was, like -
extra .. coaching, .. I might say, Oh, .. well -
you have a drama teacher. .. So -
I mean, it kinda depends. {NVC}
{VOC mouthnoise} Mean, and I don't know, cuz this is kinda vague, so I don't know what that's referring to. {VOC breath} But poetry books I think are probably important. {VOC breath} For the library. Although if you're gonna cut - {VOC breath} 'shouldn't {PRN dishn't} you already have your - {QUAL muttering} I mean .. (lot's of po-) I don't know, (2x), {VOC breath} they're not gonna, like, throw the books away. {VOC breath} Um -
Special ed teachers.
I think it's important too. .. Cooking classes, I - People don't know how to cook. I think they're kind of important. {VOC breath} Yeah, I mean, {VOC breath} I could see, like - I don't know, you don't need to offer *ten cooking classes, {VOC breath} but I think it's important to at least have a couple.
{VOC breath} Um, notetakers for disability services. .. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's - Yeah. .. Sugar-free juice machines, kicked those out. {VOC breath} Bookkeeping classes -
I think that is - Yeah, (3x) say. .. Like, I feel like .. {VOC mouthnoise} you can incorporate .. {VOC breath} {VOC breath} th- them somewhere else.
Yeah.
Um, music teachers, I - .. I would say that's important to keep. Yeah. {VOC breath} Okay, check.
So, we cut -
sugar-free juice machines.
An- get rid of more.
Um -
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Public health and safety. {VOC breath} Reproductive education.
I think - Yeah, I think so. (1x) I think that's important. Yeah. {VOC breath}
Job training programs. I think that's important. {VOC breath} Chicken pox vaccinations. {VOC breath} I th- I think they can get it, I do- I don't really know, I should probably know. {VOC breath} Um -
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, I 'would {PRN w} say, cuz I *personally didn't have a vaccination because -
I got it when I was little. {VOC breath} Um - {VOC mouthnoise} I th-
important. {VOC breath} {VOC start} But also .. for chicken pox - I - if it was just, like, vaccinations in general, I'd be like, that's important, {VOC breath} but for chicken pox, especially cuz it's not, like -
It's not super bad. .. So I don't know. I've - haven't read the other ones on the list, so I don't know. {VOC breath}
Um -
{VOC mouthnoise} Invasive species removal. {VOC breath}
{VOC start} I feel like it's important. Yeah, I -
Versus, like, a .. invasive species. I would maybe, like, k-
Weed control.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I totally didn't even - Yeah, I tend to think of just all weeds as, like, bad, but - yeah, there's invasive species versus - Yeah. {VOC breath} So we could probably - Like, if we had to pick between the two, I'd - Yeah, .. pick the .. weed control to go. {VOC breath} Um -
So, S_T_D_ education, I think that's important. .. I feel like - {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} If these were my departments, that I would, like -
'Have {PRN kav} them try to consolidate. {VOC breath} Um. .. {VOC mouthnoise} 'Toxic {PRN toxis} waste disposal. Like, that's important. .. You can't, like, just dump it down the drain! {VOC breath} Um -
Hospital additions.
I wonder what it means by additions. Like, a new building? Like, new -
I mean, keeping your hospitals up is nice, but - {VOC breath} Feel like there's too much we don't know. Like, is our hospital old and sagging, or - ? I do-
Yeah, yeah. Like, maybe, maybe wait .. a little bit. {VOC breath} Um, needle exchange, I think that's really important. {VOC breath} Um -
{VOC mouthnoise} Sex offender database. {VOC breath} That seems important. And I think people would be upset if people cut it. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Um, veterans medical assistance? {VOC breath} I think that's important. {VOC breath}
Um, weed control, we said I think that we'd .. cut that one. Pre-natal -
Yeah. {VOC breath} Pre-natal .. check-ups. Yeah, th- think that's important.
{VOC mouthnoise} And parent - Er parent. Neighborhood - Yeah, neighborhood watch support - {VOC breath} I don't -
(2x) important .. either.
Yeah. {VOC breath}
I definitely agree there.
Public -
and - .. Recreation public services. {VOC breath}
Okay, let's see how many -
The cats are - Yeah.
{VOC breath} Is that, like -
Um -
I think the newspaper's important. {VOC breath} Not sure -
I feel like - But I feel like advertisements bring you money, so -
know what they would be - I guess I'm kinda confused on that one.
{VOC start} Feeling - {VOC start} yeah. Especially - {VOC breath}
Especially, I feel like in a - (2x), depends on the size of our, like -
of our city. .. I don't know. If it's a huge - like, Seattle. .. Like, community news ads are -
I guess it says a community. Our committee in charge of (??) - {VOC breath}
Of a c- county. So that's - that's a - that's a whole county, that's a pretty big -
area.
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Probably - Yeah. Food bank, that's important. .. {VOC breath} Junior soccer league. .. I think it's -
{VOC mouthnoise} Nice.
For, like, cheaper than joining, like, a Y_M_C_A_. {VOC breath} Um, so that might be nice. I don't know, I haven't read the - Gonna read the other ones.
I don't know. Um. .. I think it's important to stay active, but - {VOC breath} Oh, kitten puppy adoption. {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
Yeah, th- {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} I know, that would mean - I would cry! {QUAL quavering} {VOC laugh}
{VOC breath} Um, soup kitchens are important. Um .. housing assistance -
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah. Um, a dog catcher -
Eh. {QUAL reluctant} I feel like if I ha-
I - I d- I f- saw it on the Hundred and One Dalmatians, but I don't - I don't actually know if that's real. {VOC breath} It's probably not real life. I think they *do have them, but - {VOC breath}
Yeah, cutting a dog catcher. I'd definitely cut the dog catcher! {VOC breath} Um -
{VOC mouthnoise} Boy's basketball club. I feel like that's kinda like the junior soccer league.
Um, what's a public access station? I don't even know what that i- No, I don't know what that is.
Like, a - a show? Like -
What do you mean? Like -
Oh, {QUAL lengthened} I didn't know that! {VOC breath} Um, I mean that's kinda cool.
Yeah, 'I wanna {PRN I wn) say, 'I wanna {PRN I wn} say, I wouldn't - I mean, you know. Soup kitchen .. or - I would probably .. cut the public acid - {VOC breath} .. I th- {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} I - Cuz the dog catcher - I mean, {VOC breath} if you don't - if people don't know that they're missing it, if they don't know that they -
had a public access station, {VOC breath} that -
they wouldn't -
care. .. I don't know. {VOC breath} Vet -
Yeah. {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Vet - vet hospital, I think is important.
Um, football stadium upkeep. {VOC breath}
Y- uh - {QUAL unsure} I mean, I don't know. Like, in - f- in Puyallup, .. like, the football .. stadium -
is, like, all three high schools use it. {VOC breath} Um, foot- football teams use it, like, the Parks and Recs teams, um, they do, like, cancer walks there. Like, it's - it's, like .. community - It's a community thing, so I think that would be important. {VOC breath} Um -
I don't know, like a high school, like, practice field, that -
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah -
(You) can't have - can- (??), like, *bedbugs. Yeah, or - Ew (??)! {QUAL disgusted}
I would pro- I don't know, I would probably cut -
I - That's what I would probably cut.
Oh. {QUAL lengthened} It - Yeah, we could do that.
I know. Can we maybe - ? I don't - I just - Like - I feel like, especially - {VOC breath}
Community *news ad.
I don't even know what t- where to get that.
{VOC laugh} {VOC breath} {VOC start} Pro- probably.
Yeah, maybe. {VOC breath}
The news ads, keep the stat- public access station.
Okay. That sounds good.
{VOC breath} Infr- infrastructure {QUAL laughing} and licensing. Okay, this'll be {VOC breath} h- {VOC breath} That's is kind of important. {VOC breath} Um, speed limit signs! I think that's a no-brainer! {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} Um, this road is sixty now. Um - {VOC breath}
Additional bus stops? I maybe .. wouldn't say additional bus stops, because that, to me, sounds like {VOC breath} they already have ten, and we wanna add .. more?
{VOC breath} Oh, I would choose the bus - Yeah, a private service. So I would pick the more - Oh yeah, didn't even - I should read all these first. {VOC breath} Um.
Yeah, I definitely would -
Yeah, I would too. If - I mean, if it was that and the taxi stops. {VOC breath} Um, tattoo artist licenses. I feel like that's really important, .. um, only because .. people ar- get tattoos and - {VOC breath} it'd be - It's good to have some {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} you know, oversight? Yeah. {VOC breath} Um, boating licenses. Especially in Washington -
I mean, if you're {VOC breath} in Montana, there's not a whole lot you're gonna boat on. But, um -
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Yeah, but if you - specially in Washington, I feel like .. that's kind of important.
Yeah, with - Yeah.
Yeah. Otherwise you're - Yeah.
Subway system. It- is it - ?
I - I would s- I would *think that it was already 'existing, {PRN eziksting} so I'd say that's probably important to, like, keep it up. {VOC breath} Hunting tags? I don't know what a hunting tag is.
Like - {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Mayb- .. 'I {PRN by} would think it b- s- maybe, like, a hunting license. I think that's important. So you don't, .. I don't know.
Going out, yeah. .. Towing services.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
Yeah.
I think -
Yeah. Especially - {VOC breath} I mean, you've been on I_-five, you know? When it's like, there's a - literally .. a car blocking an entire lane of traffic. You know, and it's like, You need to get that .. hauled away. {VOC breath} Um, 'massage {PRN massazge} certificates?
Yeah.
A taxi stops is probably the one we're gonna get rid of. Yeah. {VOC breath} {NVC}
Fishing licenses. Th- that's important. Yep.
Public bus upkeep.
And drainage 'ditches? {PRN dishes} Especially - {VOC breath} especially in Washington. {VOC breath} .. I know. Ex- Y- you look at, like - You see, like, it pour down rain in Arizona, and there's just, like, water everywhere. {QUAL whispering} Cuz they don't have any d- drainage ditches. {QUAL whispering} {VOC breath} I think we did good!
I think it would be actually really harder, cuz we didn't have to cut - {VOC breath}
That much. {VOC laugh}
So we can.. start out by, like, taking a few, or do you wanna just {NVC} talk about how it is first?
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I would put milk there.
Or.. butter, cuz we don't have milk.
Where would you put, like, produce? I guess beets were really the only thing on there that would be -
Yeah.
Yeah.
What about, like, 'toiletry {PRN toimetry} stuff? {VOC start} {VOC breath} I was thinking here, but - {VOC mouthnoise} {NVC}
Definitely wetsuits I'd put close to the boating supplies.
Like, fish hooks and -
Cool. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Thanks.
{VOC mouthnoise} And I have hats, loose-leaf paper, and egg timers.
We al- we didn't talk about where we're gonna put clothing.
I wonder if we have enough space to have a cl- clothing section here or something?
{NVC} Yeah. And, like, have few tools here, maybe.
Yeah.
So, hats, maybe up here?
I'd either put it with the power cords or.. with the siding.
Hm, right there.
Um.
Like, here?
Yeah. I have egg timers, which I think should go with the refrigerator magnets.
Above it or below it?
Yeah. Sh- {QUAL very quiet}
Um.
{VOC mouthnoise} I would say kitchen-y stuff, but -
{VOC breath} 'Loose-leaf {PRN looth leaf} paper.
With the travel guides.
'Like up {PRN gup} here? Yeah, cuz we have.. books.
{NVC} Yeah.
Thank you. {NVC}
Box knives, chocolate bars, tweezers, and mint toothpaste.
{VOC mouthnoise} Toothpaste with the -
Tweezers (2x).
Here? And then toothpaste. {QUAL muttering}
Here, or - right. {QUAL muttering}
{VOC mouthnoise} I'll just put it here. Well, I guess there's face cream, so - {VOC mouthnoise} {QUAL kind of psh-like} {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} There we go. Now it's velcroed. {NVC}
Yeah.. That's -
Right by the heavy cable.
That sounds good.
{VOC breath} Boxes of doughnuts
We could have a sweet section here with chocolate bars, boxes of doughnuts, cake.
Yeah. But that's more, like, baking.. stuff. Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Do we want it up close to the ice cream?
Yeah.
{NVC} Yeah, that's a good idea also. Like, thinking of, like, what people would buy together.
Yeah.
{VOC breath} Box knives.
Do we have a weapons section? {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} {VOC start} Should be with the tools.
Question is, heavy cable area, or the power cords down here?
Yeah.
Yeah, the electric heaters.
Well I can hold on to it, and we can - {VOC mouthnoise}
Yeah, the (2x) outdoor thing. Maybe, like, underneath the siding? I don't know.
We could also just make it a really confusing store, so that - then people would be, like, looking for one thing and then you find something else. {VOC breath} {NVC} {NVC} {VOC breath}
Hm.
That's interesting.
{VOC breath} So, I have pre-cut wood, electric heaters, bars of soap, heavy coats, and box knives again.
Hats are up there.
Just put the coats right next to them?
I'm going to put my bars of soap - {VOC breath}
Either here or here.
There's also probably face cream.
It probably doesn't -
I mean -
I'll just put it here. {NVC}
Pre-cut wood.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. The electric heaters, y- {VOC breath} we were saying could go near the power cords.
M- pre-cut wood here, maybe?
Buckets and cups.
Maybe with the kitchen stuff.
But buckets.
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Or for house cleaning.
Maybe somewhere in this, like, zone?
Yeah, yeah.
Works for me.
{NVC} Box knives.
Yeah.
We could put some tools in here. Like, saw, box knives -
Or, could it go with the mousetraps.
Because I'm thinking what else would go in that category?
Cuz this could be, like, kind of a tool wrap around, or -
Usually.. don't they have them closer to the front's of stores, so they can see people stealing them? {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
Maybe here.
Or, do y- {VOC start} I don't know. {QUAL muttering}
Yeah. {VOC mouthnoise}
Yeah.
Yeah. That works. {VOC breath} Books.. In between the loose-leaf paper and the travel guides?
Perfect. {QUAL very quiet} {NVC} {NVC} {NVC}
Um, five-pound weights?
I think so, yeah.
{VOC breath} Here?
{NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} And then I also have thick sweaters, which.. I'd put near the heavy coats.
Perfect.
Maybe with th- bundles of sticks?.. Feel like -
Outdoor -
Gardening stuff. {QUAL muttering}
I have packages of cookies, socks, rolls of duct tape, and bottle of juice. {VOC breath} I would put the cookies with the -
Doughnuts.
Small axes.
We could!
Yeah.
But maybe it's good to have the tools kind of in one area.
Yeah, perfect. {NVC}
Well I have socks.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, I don't know.
I don't remember.
{VOC breath} Socks here, maybe?
Well I have the juice. We could put -
{VOC breath} Water, juice, whiskey.
Duct tape.
With the tools? Or with the.. stationary stuff?
I'd put it with the tools.
Like, here?
{NVC} I'd put it with the boating supplies, maybe.
Fish hooks.0
Pouches of oatmeal. I'd put that with the - with the cake mix.
Shoelaces? Put it underneath socks.
Oatmeal. Where would you put that?
Yeah.
Here or here?
Yeah.. This works for me. {NVC}
Yeah.
Hm, we don't really have any other fresh produce.
Works for me. {NVC}
Per- {QUAL whispering} Perfect.
Backpacks.
Yeah, that would work. That would work.
I have large vests.
Hm, yeah.
And bagels
Bagels, I think.. that's an easier solution.
Gas-powered cookstoves? I'd put it with the pre-cut wood.
Cuz maybe it's, like camping-y -
Stuff.
Yeah.
Tweezers, yeah.
Power cords? Yeah.
That works. It's - it's close enough.
Th- the buckets and large.. cups? {NVC}
And large vests?
Just - we can just.. put it here.
And bagels. With the - right here?
We're done! {VOC breath}
Yeah, maybe we wanna analyze for a sec, yeah. {VOC breath} I guess I.. noticed that -
So.. yeah, definitely food over here. {VOC breath} That looks like the chilled.. items side.
Yeah.
Right, right. Um, and then - yeah, baked goods.. but nothing.. refrigerated here.
Um.
{VOC breath} {VOC breath} True. Dried figs, though. Um, maybe near soybeans?
'In that {PRN nat} sort of area.. although I guess we have - so, I guess.. we would populate both.. sides of that, so we would still have that side all empty.
I don't know. Um - {VOC breath}
That's a good -
That's a good one, yeah.
I like that idea.
Um.
Yes.
Yeah. {QUAL whispering}
Okay. Do you wanna try.. some? Should I, like - ? Guess I'll grab a handful. {VOC breath}
{NVC} Um. {VOC breath} Trying to be {QUAL muttering} quiet with them. Alright.
{VOC breath} So, I have toilet paper, {VOC breath} heavy cable, and books of matches.
'What do you have? {PRN d'y ave}
Okay.. Um.. {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} So we said -
{VOC breath} No, we didn't! Um.
Yeah, I was wondering that too. I bet if we crammed the hardware store things there, we could.
Yeah.. Or maybe this is just kind of a wrap around, like, there wasn't enough room on that side and - {VOC breath} I don't know. {VOC breath} Okay, yeah. Go ahead and put -
{VOC breath} Yeah. {VOC breath}
Um -
{VOC breath} Heavy cable. I'll put that.. uh -
Cable -
Cable? Is that -
(Would that) be better with power cords or siding? {VOC breath}
Which do you think?
Okay.
{VOC mouthnoise} Um, where'd we say.. uh, toiletries?
Over 'here? {PRN lengthened /h/} Okay.
Um. {NVC} {VOC mouthnoise}
I'm gonna -
Put it here so we can work up, {VOC start} cuz I forget if - how many random.. things we have. {VOC breath} Tha-
Yes, definitely. {VOC breath}
{VOC start} Maybe above? Cuz I do- I - I don't know. Yeah. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Books of matches.
Would you say.. Home Depot stuff, or.. kitchen-y stuff?
Okay.
That works. {QUAL muttering} {NVC}
They had office things sorta around where -
Oh yeah! Yeah yeah, yeah.. That sounds good.
Maybe across from the toys, sort of? Well, cuz they had -
Yeah, they sort of grouped toys and travel guides and books and stuff together and that - that seemed to work for me, when I read it. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Okay. {NVC}
{NVC} {VOC breath} There you {QUAL whispering} go. {NVC} {VOC breath}
Doughnuts, tow ropes, and cushions for deck chairs. {VOC breath} Box knives. (Chocolate bars), {QUAL whispering} tweezers, and -
Near the toilet paper.
Was there anything.. um -
Like, within - okay, yeah, cuz I was gonna say, if there were toiletries that were more - {VOC breath}
That would go better 'with {PRN w} toilet - yeah.. toilet paper, yeah. {VOC breath} I think so, yeah.
{VOC breath} Um, I don't know, I'm t- I c- don't really remember -
{VOC breath} Okay. {VOC breath} {NVC} Okay. Um.. tow ropes {VOC start} I guess I would put with  heavy cable, right?
And - or -
Boating supplies. I guess tow - well -
(Are) {QUAL whispering} tow ropes for - ? Okay. {NVC} {NVC}
{VOC breath} Boxes of doughnuts. I would say probably -
Yeah. Well, we do have cake mix and sugar here.. But those are not ready-to-eat.
Um.
Okay, yeah.
I'm gonna put it -
Y- yeah, we- somewhere - I was thinking somewhere around here, cuz then it's, like, you could wrap around from the sugar if you're.. feeling sugary. But yeah, ice cream. {VOC breath}
Yeah, the flow.. of traffic. {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
Um. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC laugh} We should. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}.. {VOC breath} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Yeah. {VOC breath} Um.
I'm trying to think.. what else - there were some sort of electrical-y things that could go more around the power cords. A- weren't there a couple electric type things?
I think.
Yeah, okay.. So, probably.. leave at least.. a space.. for.. tha- I don't know, maybe on this side, then? {VOC breath} I'm no- not r- I'm not really sure.
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay! Um, cushions for deck chairs.
I - somewhere up here, for sure.
Um.
Okay.1+
Yeah! {NVC}
{VOC breath} Okay. {VOC breath} {NVC}
{VOC laugh} {NVC} {VOC breath} {VOC laugh}  {VOC breath} Yeah! Yeah.. yeah. Kind of surprise them. {VOC breath} I read some - or, heard some interesting things about f- the flow of traffic in - {VOC breath} in grocery stores. People will always tend to, like - s- I forget if it was -
Clockwise or counter-clockwise, I'm trying to picture what I would do, cuz it -
I was - it, like, worked for me. I don't know, people, like always move in a certain direction, {VOC breath} um.. and I think it has something to do with, like, {VOC breath} the, uh, way.. you drive in that country, what side you drive on - {VOC breath} people are, like, used to moving in a certain direction. {VOC breath} Yeah, so they'll arrange things, like, get the - {VOC breath} the - I don't know.. maybe towards -
I don't know, towards one end or the other, they'll put things that are more impulse buys, because, tha- people are more likely to impulse buy {VOC breath} like, at the beginning or end. I - I don't remember the details. {VOC breath}
Okay. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Um.
{VOC mouthnoise} Well, I guess coats - we have 'hats, {PRN long /æ/} where are hats?
Oh. Yeah, okay, so coats could go up there. {VOC breath} Sure.
Uh, 'I'm gonna {PRN Imuhnuh} put my dried figs next to the soybeans.
(Oh yeah).
I'd say -
T- oh, gosh, it's such a big decision! I don't know! {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Um - {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Uh, I - yeah, I don't really know. Go for it. {VOC breath} Okay.
{VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Um.
Would think maybe in this quadrant here? {VOC start} Okay.
Yes, yes. {VOC breath}
Yeah, that works. {VOC breath} {NVC} Um.. {VOC mouthnoise} I have buckets and cups. {VOC breath}
Yeah?
Y- we- I don't know about bu- cups.. I can see that.
But it c- I mean, it could f- I guess flow from kitchen-y, then to cups, then to buckets. {VOC mouthnoise}
But buckets, depends - I mean, buckets, you use.. a lot outside. {VOC breath}
True.
Okay.
And we also have, like - don't we have, like, water jugs and things like that that migh- {VOC breath}
Um.
(??).. I'm - I'm thinking maybe above.
Cuz, mayb- okay. {VOC breath} {NVC} {NVC}
I feel like this is more, like - getting more and more sort of -
I don't know.
{NVC} Small and.. delicate.. Box knives. {VOC breath}
Uh.
I don't think we're gonna have enough clothing to fills all this. You could.. use some of this space. Yeah.. {VOC breath} Yeah, all the good.. dangerous things. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC mouthnoise}
That's a good point, too.
Yeah, go for it.
Yeah.
{VOC laugh} {VOC breath} That would make {QUAL laughing} sense. {VOC breath} Um.
Yeah, cuz what else were we gonna put on that side? Just lots of the food.. items? We don't have *all that much food. {VOC breath}
Yeah, I can put it here, and then the (front to the) store's here, so they can't - they can't run out. {VOC laugh} {NVC} {VOC breath} There (we) go. {VOC breath} Alright. {NVC} {NVC}
{VOC breath} {NVC} {NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} Okay.
I'm 'gonna {PRN uhnuh} put my butter next to the eggs here?
Unless y-
Totally. {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} {NVC} {NVC} Okay. Sticks, I'll put that with.. wood.. I guess.
Small saws. {VOC breath}
I'll put it here, with the box knives. {VOC breath} {NVC}
Um.. a- ar- are those, like, exercise weights? Is that what they mean?
Um.
'Sure. {PRN long sh} Yeah.. yeah.
Yeah. {VOC breath} {NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} And I'd say scissors, I'm 'gonna {PRN uhnuh} put that above the paper. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} And.. bags of peat moss, probably with -
Sticks? Yeah, yeah. {VOC breath}
Garden-y type stuff.
{NVC} Okay.
Let's see. {QUAL whispering}
Yes, totally.
Um, cans of peas. {VOC mouthnoise} Soybeans. {NVC}
Um, oh, small axes, nice! {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} This is interesting, cuz we have these separate - I - I mean, I guess small saws maybe would've -
G- were we gonna keep sharps here? {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Even though this is kind of a - {VOC breath} I mean, it could totally work with wood and outdoor stuff, too. {VOC breath}
Yeah. If - yeah. {VOC breath} {NVC}
{VOC mouthnoise} Um.. {VOC breath} fishing net.
Boating supplies. {QUAL whispering}
{VOC breath}  Fleece-lined boots. {QUAL sharply rising pitch on boots} {VOC breath} Did we have.. any other -
Um, clothing items that were, like.. on the top?
Okay. Cuz I was thi- so boots and socks, those would go {VOC breath} all together. I'm wondering whether we need - {VOC breath} whether we want any more space here for -
Did they have, like, gloves or.. shirts?
Okay.
I'll {QUAL breathy} put it there. {NVC}
'Just {PRN nust} in case.. there's - I forget if we have shirts or not. Yeah.
{NVC} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Where do you think water.. should go?
{VOC laugh} {VOC breath} I {QUAL laughing} like it, yeah. {VOC breath} {NVC} {NVC} {VOC breath} {VOC breath} What else?
Well, it can.. be - {VOC mouthnoise} {QUAL uncertain}
I - uh, well.. I'd say tools, yeah.
Sure. Yeah. {NVC}
{VOC mouthnoise} Wetsuits. Um.. here's some. {VOC breath} {NVC}
Fishing net.. or, yeah.
Um.
It's kinda random. {VOC mouthnoise}
Yeah, under boating supplies.
I'm 'gonna {PRN uhnuh} put my shoelaces -
Let's see. {QUAL whispering}
Do you think I should put it here or here? Sorry, what?`
Yeah.
Okay. {NVC} {VOC breath}
What was that, oatmeal?
Yeah.. probably by.. cake mix.
Like, cuz you have to do - you have to *make it, right? {VOC breath}
Um, maybe below.
Or - but w- I don't know what's g- what we're gonna put above, {VOC breath} but -
Yeah, okay. {VOC breath}
Dried figs? Or, does i- those don't have to be refrigerated, no, they're -
Just.. fresh.
Um.
I d- we don't really have any other fresh - yeah. I guess with -
The f- I mean, the figs and the beans and the peas, that's -
Like produce.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Um, light jackets, aha! I *knew I saved a space for something! {VOC breath} And - {VOC breath}
{VOC start}.. Maybe in the school-y type area?
Um.
{NVC} I guess I'll - could put it below. I don't really know if that's a space up there, anyway. {QUAL whispering} {VOC breath}
{NVC} Okay. {VOC breath}
Gas-powered cookstoves.
I mean, definitely.. over here, but -
Where do you think?
Yeah. {VOC breath}
Okay.
Yeah. {VOC breath}
Yeah, next to the deck chairs, and you have m- all that stuff out on your deck. Face cream. That was gonna be.. {VOC breath} like, here. {NVC}
Half-inch tubing. {VOC breath}
Uh, maybe around -
Well, I would.. probably put it here, but -
This is the best we have.
{VOC breath} Empty plastic -
Jugs. {VOC breath} Maybe in the kitchen-y - yeah, in this kitchen -
Thing. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} {VOC breath} I guess you're gonna have to put it under shoelaces. {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC mouthnoise} {VOC mouthnoise}
Yeah.
We're done! {QUAL sing-song}
What else would I cut?
Um.
I would cut invasive species removal, and I would .. try to make it .. volunteer-based. Because that's the kinda thing that kids'd do for like, {VOC breath} volunteer hours. {VOC laugh} And it's kinda fun, and like, gets kids involved with community clean-up, and would reduce like, {VOC breath} the cost of employing people to do it.
Where'd you go for high school?
What about that private Jewish school that you went to?
Is that at Temple B'nai Torah? .. Or is that -?
Oh really? Oh.
Oh, okay.
Aw, that's terrible.
Yeah.
I useta go there.
Yeah.
No.
{VOC mouthnoise} My parents now go to a synagogue in Woodinville, and I haven't like, really gone.
Yeah. How bout you?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Same.
Yeah, me neither.
It's like - .. Er -
(I know) we're getting distracted, but -
Yeah.
Um. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} What else would I .. cut? {VOC breath}
Cuz you'd think that would be a source of revenue for the -
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, .. it sucks to cut recreation, but -
does the county really need to pay for the junior soccer league?
Or cooking classes?
Yeah. Like football equipment, maybe the families of the - on the football team or the booster club should raise money for that instead of the county.
Well then maybe they wouldn't hafta have a football team anymore.
They'd do cheaper sports, like frisbee or {QUAL laughing} running.
Soccer.
Football's .. really expensive. Like the equipment .. per person, per athlete.
M- Yeah.
Yeah.
Sugar-free juice machines hafta go.
{VOC mouthnoise} I real- I wouldn't wanna take away music teachers. I think it's really important to have music.
But I wonder if that's the kinda thing where they could get parents {VOC laugh} who're - {VOC laugh} to do like, an art docent type thing, but probably not with music, cuz you -
Acting coaches?
Hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} I dunno.
I don't like cutting the arts.
Yeah. Even though I was .. an athlete, like all through college and high school,
and junior high, .. I would - .. I feel more ba- I feel worse about cutting the arts. {VOC laugh} Cuz I feel like people can always just do sports .. m- for whatever, but arts are something that you need more like -
Yeah.
And there are plenty of kids who maybe wouldn't have access to that. .. But they could still play soccer on the street with their friends. Like -
But like - Yeah.
Um.
{VOC mouthnoise} Tattoo artist licenses? .. That seems like, .. *really specific for adult education.
Yeah. .. I mean -
Yeah, it should be.
But if it's like a *class, it shouldn't be offered through the county.
I dunno. I don't want - I don't feel comfortable cutting the low-income programs.
What's the difference between a food bank and a soup kitchen? I guess a soup kitchen you come in, you get a hot meal, and a food bank {VOC breath} you get supplies to cook at home.
Maybe those would be things, though, that you c- that you could like, look for churches or .. um -
like, .. service groups that b- would be willing to increase their funding of it.
Sex offender database.
How - H- How much money does that really cost?
And how  many sex offenders are there, really?
Yeah.
Or they could be someone who's like,
you know, .. urinated in public a few too many times. And {VOC breath} they're registered as a sex offender
And then they lose their right to privacy, and all that.
Can't g- Can't buy housing, and -
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm not either.
Yeah.
{VOC breath} It seems weird to me that the same county that has a subway would also have -
hunting and fishing.
Cuz I'm thinking that like, a - a city that {VOC breath} is big enough to have that like, level of infrastructure, like taxis, and {VOC breath} uh, subway .. and buses,
would also have enough land -
I don't know.
{VOC  mouthnoise} What are hunting tags?
Yeah.
I mean, who really watches the public ass- access station? {VOC laugh}{VOC breath} That'd be pretty easy to cut. And then no one would notice except for like, {QUAL laughing} a few people in the retirement home.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sure.
I think we're done.
Did you know that .. the {NVC} W- Washington State government gives twice as much money to Boeing as it does to the University of Washington?
Isn't that crazy? I just learned that today.
{NVC} Yeah.
To keep them in state.
It'd be equally important to invest - At *least equally important to invest in, like, the biggest university and research -
I dunno.
Well, fortunately, it seems like we have .. similar values. {VOC laugh} So this could be easier.
So - .. Um.
We can start with two from each.
Let's cut note-takers.
(From) disability services.
Cuz you can get students to do that. Yeah.
Sugar-free juice machines. .. Screw em. We don't need em.
Um. Public .. health and safety.
What would you cut?
Yeah.
Weed control? I - I don't think -
Just - We'll just call them plants. They're plants.
Invasive species removal?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Um. And recreation and public services. {QUAL whispering}
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} I don't know.
{VOC breath} I was thinking like a community bulletin or something.
Of like, events.
I think that's somewhat important.
Um.
Yeah, let's cut that.
Football stadium upkeep? Here's my idea.
The fans can .. volunteer -
Yeah! If they love to watch football so much, {VOC breath} then they can clean up the stadium.
Well, no. No, they could like, set up -
Well I guess you'd - you'd probably - if it's a - a real football stadium, and not like a high school football stadium, you'd need like, .. skilled people to f-
And if it brings in money to the town, then it - maybe it's - .. maybe it's good to have a football .. stadium.
{VOC breath} Um.
Kitten and puppy adoption.
They should just have like a little picture of like -
cute kittens and puppies, and you know like -
Feel guilty.
How many stray dogs are there?
{VOC breath} I mean, it'd be - it'd be almost better to just have more .. like, .. spaying.
Or cats. {QUAL whispering}
Yeah.
{VOC start} So -
Public access and maybe the -
dog catcher?
I always picture like, is that - Is it The Fox and the Hound, or s- {VOC breath} One of those .. movies.
Lady and the Tramp?
Yeah, with the .. scary dog catcher.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's horrifying.
Yeah.
Infrastructure and licensing.
Yeah.
A g- A road? A curb?
Yeah. (2x) {QUAL whispering}
Massage cer-? That's a very specific -
Tattoo artist licenses and massage certificates.
Yeah.
And there are only so many .. tattoo artists and massage .. therapists who can work in a given area, .. right?
So maybe (then) we just decide that we have enough right now.
{VOC laugh} We're not gonna be accepting any new ones. {QUAL laughing}
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} I feel like pothole maintenance is pretty important.
{VOC mouthnoise} I wonder if towing services is something that could be privatized.
I mean that and taxi stops - {VOC start}
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} I think so.
Yeah.
I think two from each is a good -
I don't either.
Four.
Eight.
Yeah.
Twelve.
Sixteen.
So we're cutting like -
over ten percent .. of .. the p- .. of the programs. For - Cut two from each.
So that hasta be a pretty good -
budget .. reduction.
(??) But then what's the point of having a government? If you just cut every {VOC start} .. service?
Um.
Yeah, what else would you cut?
Other than - Yeah. You're gonna cut .. sugar-free juice and -
Oh.
Nice.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, I um -
We did that for one {QUAL lengthened} day in my high school. I forget, it was under my - we had a -
Was it (apes) -?
P_ environmental science.
Bellevue High.
Um, yeah, so we did that for one day.
That was a joke of (the) class.
Uh, J_D_S_, Jewish Day School.
Yeah. .. Although when I started, they didn't have .. T_B_T_ there yet.
Um, and they built it. They like, cut down all our favorite trees. It was awful. It was so traumatic. Yeah. {VOC breath} And um, .. I remember like, in like second grade or something, and we're all talking about, we're gonna tie ourselves to the tree, and stuff.
Anyway, so yeah, they built T_B_T_ there. Um -
And -
Yeah, so we started going there for - .. Like, they'd take us there during the day. Um,
M- .. {VOC laugh} Nice. {VOC breath} Do you still .. attend?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think my mom -
She switched to something -
Um, .. but I never really went.
I dunno. .. Yeah, after my bat mitzvah, and after {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} like, not being in private school anymore, and kind of being -
And after living on my own, I've um -
kind of -
Let's see. {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} So when it says .. cutting, like the -
licenses, like boating licenses and stuff, is that - would that mean that -
people would not be able to get boating licenses? Or would that just sort of .. change the process?
Yeah.
Maybe there's like, .. sort of a -
I don't know. I guess .. everything comes with um - {VOC breath}
I dunno. May- People hafta - People who enforce it, people who write the .. code behind it, people who -
maybe .. manufacture the licenses. But yeah, it does seem like a source of revenue, for sure.
Maybe I wouldn't cut it, just make em more expensive.
Um.
Is that .. like not -
affiliated with the school?
Okay.
Yeah. Although that's always .. hard because -
Depending on how wealthy people are.
It just - I - It - It just sucks not having .. the same kind of -
like, .. school facilities as .. your neighboring school district, cuz they're richer. But that - I - That's how things are.
Yeah.
Sad.
Yeah, soccer. Yeah.
Um.
It is - real- Yeah. It is.
Um. .. I would - I could probably get rid of cooking classes. I have it in high school programs. I mean, we have -
I feel bad, cuz, you know, it's .. (a) creative -
outlet, .. and s- I don't know. But -
I dunno.
{VOC laugh} Screw em.
Me neither.
Yeah.
Maybe, I dunno.
What about acting coaches?
I like - I - I *like the arts. Yeah. I - .. For some reason I feel a bit differently about that than cooking classes. Cuz I feel like -
{VOC mouthnoise} I dunno. I feel differently about it, I guess. {VOC breath}
Yeah?
Yeah, it's like (a) -
I feel like it's a development thing. It ro- It rounds out your development.1
Mm-hm.
{VOC breath} Yeah. True. .. Yeah.
Yeah, but for music stuff, you need like, private lessons.
If you don't have this.
Um.
{VOC breath} Uh.
Yeah.
Let's see here.
Um.
It is, yeah. It's under my professional services.
Um.
{VOC mouthnoise} I serious- I - I feel like, the licenses -
should be revenue.
Yeah. {VOC breath} I agree. {VOC breath}
I agree.
Um.
No. .. Or transportation.
Oh.
{VOC mouthnoise} I - I .. think you're right.
Yeah.
Hm.
Yeah, I don't .. honestly .. feel that strongly about it.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I - I don't know. I've always felt a little weird about that. Like -
if I had children, I would feel differently, but -
Frankly, I just think it - Yeah, it d- it doesn't - People can be creeps and not be in this database. They could be uncaught sex offenders, or sex offenders waiting to happen. {VOC breath} I -
{VOC breath} Yes. Yes. That's the r- (th-)
{VOC breath} That's the reason - One of the reasons I feel iffy about it. Cuz I just feel like -
Yeah.
Makes thing- Makes em hard - hard to move on. .. Kind of like having a
criminal history on your -
when you - on your job application. It just makes things harder to move on.
{VOC breath} Although, yeah. Maybe I'll feel different, if I -
had kids or something. But I -
{VOC breath} I .. don't feel like it's that great of an idea.
Um. {VOC breath}
Personally, I'm not, like, .. a -
I don't - I'm not a big fan of like, hunting and fishing. {VOC breath} But I don't know if that - If my personal, like -
I don't know if that's making it too personal.
Maybe .. the people need to -
{VOC laugh} True. {VOC laugh} True. {VOC breath}
Yeah. {VOC breath}
Yeah. I - I agree.
M- 'Excuse {PRN cuze} me. {VOC breath}
I don't know. I guess I was just sort of assuming it was like, sort of licenses.
I've never had one. I dunno.
Um. {VOC breath}
like, basic cable .. free anyway?
I mean, maybe it's not .. the same .. k- kinda program - Maybe people like these programs, but -
And there's always radio.
Alright.
Um. Hm.
Do you wanna be done?
Maybe?
Okay.
I think we're done.
What?
I didn't know that they gave any.
That's kinda crazy.
See, that's sick. That's just sick. {VOC breath}
Yeah. {QUAL whispering}
In the Northwest? That's crazy. .. Oh, it made me sad.
Okay. {QUAL whispering}
Yeah. {QUAL laughing} Yeah. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} S- Yeah.
Hm. How many d'you wanna cut from each -? Or we could like, start with one and see how we -
Okay.
Uh, let's see.
Education and programs. {QUAL whispering}
Cuz you can get students to volunteer to do that.
Yeah.
Alright.
Okay. {QUAL whispering}
That's tough. Cuz I th- That's an important one. {QUAL whipsering}
Um. Lemme look - Take another look at this. I was - I saw that. I was thinking maybe weed control. {VOC breath}
Um.
I mean, maybe the sex offender thing. Or -
You were talking about invasive - Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, I j- Um - I - I guess I'm not familiar with -
how big of a problem invasive species are, and how .. much .. effort goes into them, and if that effort could be -
just as well done by .. like, volunteers .. {VOC start} .. slash students. I dunno.
Or if maybe it's a bunch of people's full time jobs. I dunno.
Well, we can get rid of it. {VOC laugh}
Alright, so weed control and invasive species?
Okay.
{VOC mouthnoise} Let's see. {QUAL whispering}
{VOC breath} What are -
community news ads?
What are they referring to?
Okay.
Okay.
Sure. Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's see, let's see. {QUAL whispering}
Public access station?
Hm. {VOC breath}
Yeah? {VOC breath}
The fans? {VOC laugh}
Yeah, I was just thinking, a clean - Clean up, may- is different than like,
True. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Um.
Don't take the kittens!  {VOC laugh} No! {VOC laugh}
Um -
Yeah, that's pretty much all the -
program you need to put into it.{VOC breath} Um.
I'm trying to think w- I mean, a dog catcher sounds li- I - I - .. It's important, but I'm trying to think -
I mean, what would happen without - Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah. Which w- It says for dogs. I'm just - I'm hoping they would also do -
(dog) - I mean, yeah. It says for cats. They should do dogs too, though.
But we have veterinary hospital, so maybe it could happen through that.
(And) dog catcher?
Alright. Alright.
Um. Lady and the Tramp? {VOC breath} You're probably thinking? God.{VOC breath} S- That was .. awful. .. Awful. I would - I would like, .. start -
almost crying when I watched that. And like especially - {VOC breath}They had - {VOC start} They had like, the song or something that - and they showed all these little puppies, {VOC breath} and they had like a puppy sticking his nose through the crack, {VOC breath} and whining, {VOC breath} and I just -
I was like, a seven year old. I couldn't - not handle that.
Or whenever I watched it.
Oh God.
I still can't really handle it.
{VOC breath} Okay. {QUAL breathy} {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Um.
I think .. you had .. a good idea, with just privatizing taxi stuff.
So that's one.
{VOC mouthnoise} But I'm wonder- I just - I guess I don't quite understand how they work. .. Whether - If you cut that, what would happen? Whether .. it - .. Whether people .. would like have a harder time getting licenses, or would have to go through someone else, or -
W- .. Or - I dunno.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
{VOC breath} Well like, if it's a big city, especially, they could come and get their license, and then go -
work somewhere else.
I dunno. .. Um. (2x)
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah. .. Yeah.
Yeah, I th- I think a lotta the transportation stuff's important.
Yeah. Yeah, now I think about it, I mean -
Lincoln and whatever, d- Aren't they all private?
Alright, yeah. Let's do that.
Okay.
Yeah.
I don't like cutting things in general.
Yeah, I noticed in the - .. in the - first activity. {VOC laugh}
Oh.
Alright. {VOC breath}
Yeah. .. Unless - Yeah. Maybe they wanted to cut everything. {VOC laugh} But that's not gonna happen. {QUAL laughing}
Thank you. Thank you. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}Alright.
Yeah. {QUAL whispering}
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
And this is all non-food things.
Yeah. Well, it can go - m- well - {QUAL lengthened} .. I dunno. Some things are just (not in their place). Do you wanna take one? Starts us off?
I would think this aisle, yeah.
People buy liters of water when they go out- .. doors.
N- No? {QUAL lengthened}
I have no idea though. I dunno what else is in here.
(Cross some) power cords? I like that.. Yeah.
Here's another one that can go right there.
Duct tape.. And -
I think that's good.
Scissors.
Maybe.. That could also be with like, school supplies. May like, refrigerator m- Well.. Toys.. kind of, are usually near the -
We can put it where we want, though. {VOC breath} We're in charge here. So -
Mm-hm.
Down there?
Yeah.
Cool.
Maybe they're heavy duty scissors.
Yeah. {VOC breath}
Loose leaf paper.
That's right there with scissors. {QUAL whispering}
Yeah. {QUAL lengthened}
I dunno.
Toys is gonna be awfully alone up here.
That's okay.
Yeah, let's put next to scissors. It makes sense.
Half inch tubing
Yeah. {VOC breath}
I think so.
Boxes of doughnuts. {QUAL whispering}
Probably. {QUAL whispering}
I'm not sure though. Mm.
May- next to cake mix, yeah. {VOC breath}
Empty plastic 'jugs. {PRN lengthened}
Yeah.
(We're running) outta room on this aisle.. Yeah. That looks fine.
Beets. {QUAL funny voice}
Oh, there's -
Yeah.
M- There's a be a lot more food, I think. But yeah, we can put there.
Eggs and beets?
They go together. Eggs and beets definitely go together. {VOC laugh}
Pa-Yeah.. {VOC breath}
S- put up here.
Yeah.. I th- it's good. {VOC breath}
Electric heaters.
That first aisle again. {VOC breath}
Hats.
No. We to make an area. {VOC breath}
I think like, somewhere up here. I don't think there's that many toys and stuff, so I think we should put it .. near there.
Here's another one.
Face cream probably should go around toilet paper.
That's an easy one. {VOC breath}
Maybe like -
Up here?
More like outdoorsy. Boating supplies, and -
Traveling.
Next to boxes of doughnuts?
Fishing net.
'It's {PRN ts} easy.
Yeah {QUAL creaky} {VOC breath}
Light jackets, with more clothing? {VOC breath}
Books. {VOC breath}
Yes. {VOC breath}
That's okay. .. I think that's good.
Sticks of 'butter. {PRN funny voice}
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. That's totally right.
Heavy coats.
I would think so. {VOC breath}
(Was uh-) Oh, refrigerator magnets. Kind of it - Well - .. Maybe not.
Usually with the cooking stuff. Yeah. I think so.
P- next to the eggs.
Yep.
Yep. Yep. Totally.
'Buckets {PRN creaky, long} .. Sh- Empty. Where was that empty -
Plastic jugs.
'That's {PRN ass} what I think. {VOC breath}
Bagels. {QUAL creaky}
{VOC breath} I said bagels.
Wasn't there -? We don't have bread yet?
Yeah, we don't.
Yeah. {QUAL creaky}
Yeah, let's put down there.
(There's probably gonna be) bread.
Peat moss.
Yeah, it should. I think outdoorsy stuff. It's like - .. yeah, like right here.
Looks fine. {QUAL creaky}
Large cups.. Tsh tsh tsh tsh tsh..We don't have anything like that yet?
Well, how bout near pet food?
Heavy cable.
Garage.
Maybe right there? {VOC breath} Yeah.
Thick sweaters?
Obviously.
Wet suits. {VOC breath}
Hm.
Yeah.
Whiskey.
That would make a lotta sense.
If you're trying to sell the two together. Um.
Probably.
But - {QUAL creaky, long}
Which end?
I mean, it shouldn't go like right there next to cookies. That's just weird.
Yeah.
I think .. next to sugar.
Tow ropes. {VOC breath}
It's true. {VOC breath}
Yeah.
I'm not sure what they mean by tow ropes. Like to hook onto a k- Yeah, it should go in a garage. Kinda thing. .. No matter what.
Books of matches. .. Uh, that could go either way.
That could be outdoorsy camping or -
It could be -
Yeah, kitchen supplies.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Do it.
Backpacks.
I don't know.
I dunno what - .. If they mean like, school supplies, which we kinda have down there, next to the duct tape.
(And) then toys and books -
{VOC laugh} (All of R_E_I_) {QUAL laughing}(It's) all about which kind of backpack it - it is.
Yeah, do it.
It's an R_E_I_ backpack. {VOC breath}
Camping backpack. Do it.
Um. {QUAL lengthened}
Yeah, put it there.. Just in case (we uh) put something across (from) duct tape.
Chocolate bars. {QUAL creaky, long}
Yeah. {VOC breath} Next to ice cream. {VOC breath}
Large vests.
Five pound weights?
Kind of like -
Work out stuff, which -
'Something {PRN somethinnn}
Either here or here.
Across from the stoves?
Okay.
Yeah. .. Yeah, put it there. Yeah, it's fine.
No.
Pre-cut wood.
That would be - {QUAL creaky} Yeah.
Yeah. {QUAL creaky}
Oh.
Bathroom stuff. {VOC cough} Dried figs.
(Mean uh) We have a lotta room down here.
Mm-hm.
Fish hooks.
Yeah. Yeah, do it. Next to wetsuits.
Fleece lined boots.
Bundles of sticks. {VOC breath}
Great.
Box knives.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} I like that. .. Small saws. This - all in the first -
Great.
Cushions for deck chairs. {VOC breath}
Pet food and large cups?
Um.
True.. Yeah.
Yeah, we need to fill up some of that space. We only have -
four more. Yeah.
Okay. {VOC breath} And then, socks. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Easy.
Bars of soap.
Yeah. Cake mix and -
Breakfast stuff? Really? {VOC laugh} The doughnuts (2x) {VOC breath} Cans of peas.
Um.
Yeah.
Yeah. .. It's great.
We're done.
I think we did a great job. I'd shop here.
So this is going to be really similar to -
This actually looks a lot like
your
list. Because look.
More food, and then the
toys, and er -
Mm.
Oh, except travel guides. That was down in
the other -
with the books.
Mm-kay. {VOC breath}
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Sure.
{VOC breath} Liters of water. {VOC breath}
Would you say this aisle?
Me too.
Maybe into - {VOC breath}
Does it matter to you?
{VOC mouthnoise} Travel guides, siding, mouse traps. {QUAL breathy}
Maybe we can put it down here, for -
Um.
Power cords and -
I dunno. Things that you might have in your garage.
Or for camping. {VOC laugh} Is that it? {QUAL laughing}
Yeah. Totally. {VOC breath}
Scissors.
Probably in the same supplies, right? With power cords?
Oh, that's true.
We can put it wherever we want.
I think - {VOC breath}
Because I don't think there were any other art supplies, {VOC breath} I would put scissors with art supplies.
So, I think instead, I might put it 'in the {PRN lengthened} - um - kinda the utility -
Maybe yeah, with the duct tape.
Those are similar. They're - I think they're probably really heavy duty scissors.
'Okay. {PRN long o}
Would you also say with scissors? Like with other -?
I know.
Okay.. I'll put it across from scissors.
Oh. {VOC breath} Also on this one.
{VOC mouthnoise} Up here, you think?
Kay.
Boxes of doughnuts.
I'd have to say over here.
With the sh- With the sugar, and the ice cream, the sweets? Cake mix?
Mm-kay.
Um, {QUAL lengthened} maybe up here?
Okay, with the tubing. {VOC breath}
Kay, where do we want -? Oh, there's eggs and soybeans.
Over here.
Mm-hm.. Mm-kay.
Put it in th-
This is going to be -
Maybe produce {VOC breath}
Yeah.
Bottles of juice.
Okay.
I would put it over here, too, probably, in the food.
Not over here. You wouldn't have that in your garage.
Maybe in the middle.
Okay.
Oh yes. {VOC breath}
Kay.
Hats. {VOC breath}
We don't have clothing yet.
Should we put it in the middle?
Mm-hm.
Mm-kay. Good idea. Cuz we'll probably have more clothing items.
Shoe laces.
Face cream. {VOC breath} Totally.
Small axes?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Kay.. Yeah traveling with axes.
Yep.. Perfect.
Fishing net up by boating supplies? {VOC breath}
Okay. {VOC breath}
Mm-hm.
With toys?
Okay.. I think in mine, it was next to travel guides, but I like it better up here.
Way better up there.
Sticks of butter. {VOC breath} Next to eggs? {VOC breath}
Dairy?
Oh, but ice cream's up there. Oh well.
Gas powered cook stoves.. {VOC breath} How 'about {PRN bout} next to the electric heaters?
Next to light jackets? {VOC laugh} Okay. {QUAL laughing}
{VOC laugh}I would think so, too. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath}
Uh - Egg timers?
'Is that -? {PRN izzat}
Like for hard boiled egg-? {VOC breath}
I think it would go with .. {VOC breath} probably -
on the .. little siding next to the eggs.
Although it could belong in other places. {QUAL creaky} {VOC breath}
Buckets. {VOC breath}
Here?
{VOC breath} Oh, yeah.
Okay.
{VOC mouthnoise} That sounds good.
'Bagels. {PRN baggles}
(Did you say bagels?) {QUAL whispering}
Should this be down -? {VOC breath} Since we don't really have baked goods.. We have the doughnuts and cookies, but-
{VOC breath} Maybe it should.
{VOC mouthnoise} To make room. {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}What *is peat moss? That goes over here, right?
Maybe.
Kay. {VOC breath} Bags of peat moss.
Large cups.
{VOC breath} Not really. {VOC breath}
Okay.
All the extras. Heavy cable. Here? Here?
Kay.
Maybe pow- Next to power cords.
Kay.
Obviously. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} I think it would go in here, too.
Cases of whiskey.
Next to the large cups?
No, I think it should go in the food aisle.
The liquids and food. Cuz we don't really have any of that over here.
Oh, yeah. {VOC breath}
No, it should go at the top or the bottom, probably.
'I don't {PRN I-O} know how many liquids we'll have. Probably - Yeah. 'Should {PRN sh} we just go up?
{VOC mouthnoise} You need sugar to mix drinks sometimes. {VOC laugh} .. Tow ropes? How 'about {PRN bout} next to the other .. cables?
Um.. Yeah. Perfect. {VOC breath}
Yeah.
(Into -).. Weird other supplies? {VOC breath} I think it fits more into .. the -
This sort of a thing. {VOC breath} Do - Should I fill in this spot up here?
Kay, risky.
Backpacks.
Would you put it over here, too?
For like, backpacking?
Or would it be school supplies?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.. {VOC breath} I would still be inclined to put it here. This is like R_E_I_ to me. {VOC laugh} They have a 'lot of {PRN lotta} backpacks. Yeah.
It - Yeah, it depends.
{VOC laugh} Okay. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} Where do you think -? Just -
Maybe down here?
{VOC laugh} Okay. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} Chocolate bars. {QUAL creaky}
With the sweets?
{VOC breath} Yeah. {QUAL breathy} {VOC breath}
Yeah.
Yeah, I would put it over here.. {VOC breath} Um.
I kinda wanna put it *right in the middle. {VOC breath}
Yeah.
It doesn't really make sense.
Just because it doesn't really belong in either ends of what we're going with. But it does - It should go in - .. It should go in the garage. {VOC laugh}
Okay.
Next to paper?
And duct tape? {VOC laugh} Kay.
Mint tooth paste.
Here.
Yep.
Yeah.. Maybe we should put it with the other.. um -
Fruits and vegetables. That's where it is in Trader Joe's. {VOC breath} The figs.
Yep.
Maybe up here, with all - .. We've got a lotta fishing. {VOC breath}
So, (ob-) That should go up there. But really - {VOC breath}
Kay.
Yeah.
More bundles of sticks. How bout down here? {VOC breath}
Also over here, do you think?
Um, maybe just right up here?
Okay. I'm putting it right here, too.
Yeah, we have a lot in this one.
I would put that in our random section. Maybe.
Yeah {QUAL laughing}
Cuz pet food was there. We couldn't have moved that into food.
So now it's just kind of like -
An extra aisle?
Maybe seasonal things?
Mm-kay. {VOC breath}
Socks.
{VOC breath} I'll put it up here by hats. {VOC breath}
Kay.
{VOC mouthnoise} 'Um. {PRN lengthened}
Maybe here?
Some breakfast stuff, .. kind of?
I mean, the doughnuts. The doughnuts could be.
Down here? Soy beans?
Kay.
I think we did a really good job.
{VOC mouthnoise} Alright, Heather. {VOC breath}
Okay.
Yeah, we could. It -
So.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
At lea- Start with two. Two from each, yeah.
Yeah. .. Yeah.
So then {QUAL lengthened} .. Math tutors.
{VOC laugh} Alright, we'll keep speech therapy. {QUAL laughing}
And you gotta have custodians. Sex ed's really important.
I don't even understand what - Is this like a program where they train assistant cooks?
Football equipment - Are they *buying football equipment for kids? Cuz we don't need that.
Yeah. Make em pay for it on their own.
Mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Well, it's all about whether or not you appreciate the arts.
So.
Gotta keep the acting.
Gotta keep poetry. .. Gotta keep the arts.
Yes.
{VOC breath} 'Yes. {PRN yess} I think so.
Note-takers.
Sugar free juice machines.
It's im- .. portant, .. but I don't understand why the government's paying for it.
Yeah.
*You sound like you are very opposed to sugar-free juices.
It's true.
Yes. .. That's important. And music teachers are important.
These are all important things (cept for) football equipment.
Okay.
Yeah. I don't really care. .. I wouldn't ever use it myself, so -
Yes.
We'll start with those two.
That's what I'm assuming. Yeah. They don't need new equipment every year.
That's silly. .. Um. {QUAL lengthened} .. Okay, moving on.
Public health.
Yes.
Why is that not in education and programs?
(and so) Okay. {VOC breath} Yeah. Okay.
{VOC start} Definitely.
Oh, wait a minute.
I don't know. I never got a vaccination.
They do now? So kids never have chicken pox anymore? They're missing out on an important part of childhood.
*I'd say we get rid of that one, let them have chicken pox for awhile.
Sit at home in a oatmeal bath.
Okay.
Invasive species removal.
I think so. {VOC breath}
(S_T_D_) education.
Didn't .. we have that?
I mean sex ed.
It should be part of sex ed.
Yeah.
Yeah, there's a lot of overlap here.
What is it - Sex ed and reproductive education? .. Same thing.
Un- Oh. Reproductive education is probably for moms. .. Expecting mothers.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
I wonder if S_T_D_ education is redundant then.
Probably.
Mm-hm.
Sure.
Yeah.
What does that mean?
Mm. {QUAL lengthened} Maybe. I dunno if we need that.
Yeah?
Okay.
It depends, yeah.
Yes. {QUAL creaky, long S}
{VOC start} Yeah. {QUAL creaky}
Yee- .. Yee- .. Yes. .. Yes.
Weed control? .. No. {QUAL creaky}
{VOC start} Yeah. Well - Invasive species removal should do enough. {VOC breath} Yeah.
Should be (in) reproductive education.
Yeah. Hm.
I guess we hafta keep all of it, don't we? Just to be safe.
Okay.
That I would say get away. {VOC breath} Give away. {VOC breath} We don't need it.
Right.
We already - We're gonna take out -
Chicken pox?
Oh, yeah.
Right.
That's redundant.
Either neighborhood watch support or chicken pox.
Oh, yeah, weed control. That's right. Yeah, that one.
Sorry, yeah. Weed control. Yeah. .. Weed control and S_T_D_ education.
Done.
Stray cat spaying?
No.
Dogs -
I think so, but cats? I don't mind having cats run around on the streets. .. They're fun.
Uh, {QUAL creaky} no?
Yeah, no, we don't (need) that.
Yeah.
Definitely need a food bank.
Um. Probably?
That's probably a pretty cheap one. .. Football equipment's not cheap, but junior soccer league should be.
Kitten and puppy adoption?
{VOC laugh} Yeah, then you get adopted, yeah. .. Keep that one.
Soup kitchens? Yes.
Yes.
Yeah. Gotta bring em in to the kitty and pup- (??)
And then - .. Basketball? Do we want that as well as soccer?
I think this one is .. not fair. Boys basketball club? .. What about the girls? Girls can play soccer too.
I say we cut it, just to be -
Gender .. neutral. Yeah.
Like, uh, public .. television.
Um. {QUAL lengthened}
I don't know.
I 'don't {PRN own} know. Let's see what else we can cut.
We need the - Wait - Veterinary hospital?
Probably, yeah.
Mm.
I dunno, we already cut the equipment. Might as well just cut all of that sport. {VOC laugh} No. {VOC breath} Let's keep that one.
Pest control.
Probably need that, as well.
So we could cut -
Yeah. Boys basketball. And either stray cat spaying or community news ads?
Yeah.
I don't either.
Yeah.
Cool.
Infrastructure and licensing.
Sure. {VOC breath}
No, we (can get rid of em) {VOC laugh} Keep that.
Yeah. .. I don't know what that means, additional bus stops. (Are we) increasing the budget if we keep that?
That's silly.
Yeah.
In - In our f- In our fictional town, I think it runs great. .. But we could use additional -
I don't think that's necessary.
Mm-mm.
M- Well, except .. that's - What that is is regulating tattoo industry. We don't want anyone on the street -
Puncturing holes in you, so -
This could - Yeah. {VOC breath} .. For public health .. concerns, we probably should keep it.
Yeah.
Boating licenses, probably should keep that too.
Yeah. {QUAL creaky, lengthened}
We can cut the whole subway system -
With one stroke? That's amazing.
(1x) Let's not do that. {VOC breath} Yeah, let's just keep it. {VOC breath}
Mm.
Probably. I dunno -
How much hunting - Well, it's like when you go out and you kill something, if you have tags, you have a permit to .. kill that one animal, or five of those animals.
So if you got rid of that -
Right. But, how much hunting can you do in a place (where) there's also subway system? .. I don't understand where we are right now. {VOC breath}
(Must) like hunting -
Squirrels or something.
Yeah.
No? {QUAL lengthened}
Private sector can do that, just fine.
Kay.
don't -
need it.
I don't know why we would have to certify masseuses
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, otherwise, it could be chaos, with taxis stopping everywhere. If you have stops, it could help a little bit.
And if they were there already, then it might just be really confusing if you get rid of them all of a sudden.
Mm-hm.
{VOC start} They've already been there. Yeah. Keep (it) around. I dunno. {VOC breath}
Mm-hm.
Yes.
Yes.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah. .. I think that's good, though, because if (we hafta) cut the same from every category -
It's really hard to cut 'something {PRN sum-m} from public health and safety.
(??) the two (that) we cut were the only two we could do.
(Or) we could do three. We could do the chicken pox, maybe.
Did we?
Oh, it was education (and) programs. *That one was hard to cut .. any more than two.
Unless we cut -
Yeah. If we cut acting coaches. Which is fine with me. Cut the acting coaches. And then -
And then we'd have three from each category. We could do that.
How much do you wanna cut?
Just two from each?
Mm-kay.
Then we're good.
We're done.
I think so.
I really wish I knew what kind of a town this is.
Okay.
Should we figure -? Okay.
Maybe we should decide a couple to - We can talk though them all, but we can decide maybe a couple to cut. .. Like maybe two to cut. .. From each category.
Mm-hm.
Then, that just keeps it easy, and even.
Mm-kay. Math tutors. {VOC breath}
Assistant cooks.
Sex ed. Custodians. .. Well we can't cut speech therapy. That's the only one I know about.
Okay. You hafta have custodians, you hafta have sex ed. {VOC breath} Assistant cooks?
Yeah, I'm not sure. Or if it's just within the schools?
Mm-hm.
Like new football equipment?
M- Mm-kay. So we have - That might be one we wanna cut.
Acting coaches?
Yeah, I - Yeah. We hafta -
decide. .. Okay, we can keep -
Acting, poetry, special ed teachers. We hafta have those. {VOC breath} Cooking classes?
Yeah. {QUAL breathy} I think so too.
Note-takers? Yes. {VOC breath}
That can go.
No.
I think that one definitely hasta go. .. I understand .. why it's there.
Because I think - No, I think that's fine. The sugar-free juices. And I - What it stands for, but I think all the *moms can pack sugar-free juice if they need to.
Bookkeeping classes?
I'd say yes. Music teachers? Yes.
Okay, so, let's (sen-) Let's cut - If we hafta cut two things, .. let's cut sugar-free juice machines. .. {VOC mouthnoise} If that's okay with you.
Okay. .. And football equipment?
(Can -) .. Assuming that it's new equipment, each year.
Kay.
Kay, moving on. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} Reproductive education?
Yes.
I think it just goes back to (those) other categories. It can be under both.
Job-training programs? I would say yes.
Chicken pox vaccinations? .. Yes.
{VOC mouthnoise} Right?
They do vaccinations now. Mm-hm.
Mm-mm.
I know. {QUAL laughing}
{VOC laugh} Okay, we'll put it on - {QUAL laughing} We'll put it on the maybe list. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Yes.
You know -
We have -
And reproductive education.
Okay, so that might be on the maybe list too, cuz that could go under - .. That *will go under - Okay, yeah, that's - that's one of ours.
{VOC breath} Yeah. {VOC breath}
Yeah. I'm thinking the sex ed is more of the younger age, .. and then reproductive education is once they actually (do) - they're pregnant
I think it is. I think we should put that on our -
maybe list.
Toxic waste disposal?
Yes.
Hospital additions?
Um, maybe new -
departments? Or new -
I think that's important.
I think so.
Depending on what the need is, for the community.
Needle exchange? .. Yes. .. Sex offender database?
Yes.
Veterans medical assistance?
I think, .. yes.
Mm-hm.
Not as important.
We have the invasive species removal. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
Okay.
Prenatal check-ups?
It should. That might be more under the medical side, though. The education might be more under -
They might be two different, .. you know, programs doing that.
Yeah, I think we do need to keep the prenatal check-ups.
And neighborhood watch support.
Give away?
Mm-kay. For funding. {VOC breath} Well, {VOC breath} we only need to choose two.
That need to go. .. If we want to keep it even.
We were gonna take out -
We were definitely going to take out S_T_D_ education, cuz that fell under what we're already paying for, over here.
And then, what's the next .. least important one?
{VOC mouthnoise} Or weed control.
Weed control?
Okay. .. We'll keep the other ones.
Mm-kay.
Kay, recreation? And public services.
That one's tough. {VOC breath}
Lotsa stray cats, okay. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} Okay. {VOC breath} Community news ads.
{VOC mouthnoise} .. I'd say put that in the no list too. We'll decide - We'll prioritize after.
Food bank? .. Yes.
Junior soccer league?
I'd say yes, compared to the other ones.
Probably.
Yeah. .. I agree.
Well, if we gave - {QUAL laughing} (If) we stop spaying the cats, then yeah, we're gonna need that. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
Uh-huh, yes. .. Housing assistance? Yes.
Dog catcher?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm. Maybe that w- We'll hafta decide that .. later.
{VOC breath} Oh. Where are the girls?
Yep.
Okay. .. Just to make a s- tatement.
Public access station?
Don't quite know what that is. {VOC breath}
Like (where) resources? Oh. Oh, okay.
It's prob- Is that one of the more expensive things?
Okay.
So maybe we're keeping it at the minimum.
Veterinary hospital? .. Probably.
Football stadium upkeep?
We probably need that.
Kay.
And pest control.
We probably do.
So, we're going to cut boys basketball. .. To make a statement.
Oh, I would say -
community news ads. {VOC start}
Cuz I don't -
totally know what that is.
I'd say we cut it.
Kay.
Next.
Teaching certificates? .. Yes. .. Speed limit signs?
We don't - Kay, we don't need those. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} Okay. {QUAL laughing} {VOC breath} Additional bus stops?
{VOC start} Oh. {QUAL lengthened} We might be - We might be increasing the stops. So, let's keep that.
I think our transportation actually runs really well right now.
We may not need the extra ones. We'll hafta see. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Tattoo artist licenses?
{VOC mouthnoise} That doesn't seem like it should fall under our .. umbrella.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Oh. {QUAL lengthened} To do that?
That's actually a good point.
Okay.
Yes.
Pothole maintenance? .. I'd say yeah.
Subway system?
{VOC start} That's tough.
Because we don't know where we are, in the .. process
Hunting tags. {VOC breath}
Probably.
So -
I don't really know what that is, but -
Mm-hm.
But we want that so things don't get outta control.
Like the tattooing.
{VOC breath} {VOC laugh} Yeah, might fall into another -
Rural area?
Kay, well, .. we'll come back to that one.
Towing services?
Okay. .. That'll be on our list then. {VOC breath} This one's tough. This one's a little more tough.
Massage certificates?
Mm-hm.
Because -
Yeah.
I - That kinda falls under the other ones. I can see why they put it in there. Like tattoo artists and teaching. But I think massage is different.
Kay.
Taxi stops? {VOC breath}
We probably don't need to do that either.
Yeah.
Okay, yeah. That'll help.
{VOC breath}Yeah, that's true. It's hard to know if we're .. implementing these, or if we're just -
Mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Fishing licenses? Yes. {VOC breath}
Public bus upkeep? Yes. .. Drainage ditch- ditches?
Yes. Okay, so we have massage certificates to get rid of.
And then the other one that I think was the most obvious was the towing services.
The other ones were a little bit harder.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Oh, S_T_D_ - No that - We had three, on our list. Potentially.
Mm-hm.
Cuz we - Cuz we were .. supportive of the arts.
{VOC breath} Yeah, we could do that.
I think we're good on cutting two. {VOC breath}
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so too.
I think they're all very justified.
{VOC laugh} (Subway s-) {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
{NVC} Well. {VOC breath}
We start with cans of peas.
I'm thinking -
I would put them in, uh, an area with other canned items.
Uh -
Of food.
(On) the other hand, I'm not sure I would put them right with the pet food. {VOC breath}
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well in *that case -
I'll p- let's see -
Where would be {VOC breath} the most canned item -
None of these are really -
Canned, but -
{VOC mouthnoise} I'm thinking maybe more with the soybeans. Things that are not fresh foods. (2x) they're packaged in some way.. That are not open.
Bundles of sticks.
Is, uh - {VOC breath} I guess kind of a housewares item for starting fires and things.
S- thinking -
More the left column, with either sporting, traveling, or houseware type items. Maybe with -
Yeah.
Yeah!
Hhh, let's see -
Empty plastic jugs.
Well, kind of a storage thing for filling up -
Basements, or -
Disaster preparedness areas.
'Perhaps - {PRN hhaps} of course, you can use them in the kitchen as well. {VOC breath}
So 'it'd {PRN id} *either be a housewares item, or -
A kitchen item. {VOC breath}
What do you think?
Yeah.
And we have *hats. Let's see, are there any other clothing items here that would - {VOC start}
Be associated.
Not really.
Well, {VOC breath} we're looking at things that you don't -
*Eat, that aren't - {VOC start} {VOC breath} necessarily houseware items.
But, it's something for ou- going out of doors.
Perhaps -
Yeah, boating supplies.
'Alrighty. {PRN h-righty) {VOC breath} You get to pick a few.
Bagels.
Yeah.. Perhaps near the eggs. Ma-
Sandwiches for breakfast with them.
Yeah.. yeah. {VOC breath}
Personal care, definitely. {NVC}
Books.
Yes! They're reading - reading s- {VOC start} items.
Alrighty. {VOC breath} Get a couple here.
Cases of whiskey. {VOC breath} Well -
'Are {PRN ha} there any other alcoholic items?
No?
Yeah.
So, with the cans of peas and so on? {VOC breath} Ca- cuz (on) cases. Yeah.
And then that wants to know about dried figs. Would we want to store those or eat them sooner?
Yeah. {NVC}
'That {PRN hat} sounds good to me. {NVC}
'That's {PRN ts} a house supply, I guess with the power cords maybe?
Hm, travel gear.. Perhaps with the travel guides? {VOC start}
Buckets.
Yeah. {VOC breath} {NVC} Think so.
Cushions for desk chairs.
Hm. House supply kind of thing.
Perhaps with the siding?
Tweezers! Something for the bathroom. Maybe with.. the toothpaste?
(Yeah).
Yes.
Mm, perhaps with the backpacks and other travel supplies? {VOC breath} Or else the bundles of sticks, one of the two.
Yeah.
Yes!
Definitely.
Large cups.. Hm.
Perhaps with the, uh - {VOC breath} other things that we're storing.
Unless these are meant for the kitchen.
So I'm thinking 'either {PRN eitha} kitchen or with the s- things we're storing in the basement.
Yeah!
Yeah.
'And {PRN han} bars of soap. {VOC breath} Makes me think of the bathroom. {VOC breath} {VOC laugh}
Pouches of oatmeal.
Hm.
'Is that {PRN sat} for traveling or more.. just for a quick breakfast before school?
Yeah. {VOC breath}
(Where'd) I put the cake - ? There it is.
{NVC} Mm.
Egg - well, the soybeans.
Either one.
Oh, th- if they're dried, I don't know.
Mm, say with the backpacks, in that area.
Yeah.
Egg *timers! Hm, possibly with the eggs? {VOC laugh}
Or the fridge magnets, yes!
Where'd I put the - here they go.
Packages of cookies.
Not fresh, but packaged.
'Yeah. {PRN nyeah}
And where did I put -
The oatmea- {VOC laugh}
Oh.
Here we go. {VOC breath} Yeah.
And chocolate bars.
Same area, or somewhere else?
Okay!
Yeah..
J- more junk food.
Yes!
'Yeah. {PRN yuh}
Yes, definitely.
Yep! That's 'what I'd {PRN why'd} do.
Let's see. Half-inch tubing. {VOC breath} Makes me think of household projects.
Along with the.. duct tape and power cords and box knives?
Yeah, hm.
'Yeah. {PRN hyehh}
With the thick sweaters and heavy coats, maybe?
Then {VOC breath} bottles of juice.
Hm. 'Well if {PRN lif} it was *one bottle, I'd say where the refrigerator stuff is, but
Lots of them? Maybe for storage. What do you think?
Okay.
School supplies!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes!
Fish hooks.
Other travel and sporting gear?
Yeah.
Fleece-lined boots.
Yep.
And *face cream! Something for the bathroom.
The bars of soap.
Traveling stuff?
I guess camping.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.. Or else the tubing, one of those two. {VOC laugh} Yeah.
Yeah.
Definitely.
Well, we have *shoelaces. Something else for the home.
Or for.. domestic - well, we could put it with the other clothing items.
The boots and such.
Small saws.
Hm, {VOC start} would that be a camping supply?
Yeah.
See if I can remember -
S- ah, here we go.
With the sticks, do you think?
Small sticks -
Here we go, *bundles of sticks.
That's w- I was looking for the word small.
{NVC} Okay.
Hm. S-
'Yep. {PRN yuh-p (p is popped)}
Power cords?
Uh-huh!
And the boats and all that.
Well, (1x), I think we're done!
{VOC mouthnoise} Or food.
'Yeah, and it looks like {PRN yanalooksik} the third column is just food, everything else is -
Other stuff.
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay.
Yeah.. Yeah, probably up - 'maybe even {PRN maybeven} the *top where the boating supplies are, like outdoor stuff.
Mm.
I'd probably store them by the mousetraps.
Mm, I don't really - {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise} 'Yeah, {PRN næh} maybe up by the boating supplies too, yeah.
{VOC laugh} {VOC mouthnoise} Oh - {VOC breath} (4x) {NVC} {VOC breath}
Stay on the right side. Yeah, thanks.
Uh, 'let's see. {PRN tsee} {VOC breath} Uh, bagels. I'm (presuming we) probably put those with food.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
Uh, mint toothpaste. Probably more like toilet paper.
Bathroom stuff.
Um, books.
Hm.
Probably maybe by travel guides.
S- probably are already books.
Hm, no, but you've got, like, storage, food stuff near the bottom, there.
Yeah, maybe.
Right.
Hm, maybe by the cake mix? {VOC breath} I don't kno-
(Thanks). {VOC breath}
Hm.
Uh, duct tape.
Probably more like.. um -
Yeah.
And backpacks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hm. {VOC mouthnoise} Empty plastic jugs?
{VOC start} {VOC breath} Yeah, that sounds reasonable.
Yeah.
Mm, small axes. Probably going with the power cords and duct tape, I would imagine.
Uh, books of ma- {VOC breath} {VOC cough} 'Excuse {PRN scuse} me, books of matches.
Um.
Yeah. {QUAL rising intonation}
(It's) close to both.
Uh, box knives -
Probably with duct tape again, maybe?
Right.
{NVC} Mm - {NVC} 'I don't know, {PRN I know} maybe with refrigerator magnets. I mean, maybe that's -
Place for fridge - or, uh, kitchen stuff.
Yeah, probably.
Mm.. {VOC mouthnoise} I am - {VOC mouthnoise} I'd probably throw it with the cake mix. {NVC}
Uh, beets.
Probably go 'with - {PRN worth} by the eggs. 'I'm {PRN m} presuming.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, cuz it's a vegetable. Yeah, yeah.
Large vests. That's probably outdoor stuff.
'Yeah. {PRN hyeah}
And {QUAL lengthened} heavy coats, probably same fi- same deal. {VOC breath} Travel.
Going outside. {VOC breath}
Yeah, or the fridge magnets, or -
'Eh, {PRN nasalized (ae)} probably by the figs and oatmeal, maybe. {VOC breath}
Right there. You were just - it's right - right above your hand, there.. Yeah, keep going. There you go.
Mm. {VOC breath}
Maybe on the side, where ice cream is.
Boxes of doughnuts. I'm presuming they probably go by the chocolate bars and the ice cream.
{VOC start} {VOC cough} Exactly.
Uh, sticks of butter, maybe down by the eggs and bagels.
Fishing net. Probably up by the boating supplies and sticks.
And thick sweaters, probably by the heavy coats and vests.
Yeah, or the jugs and buckets. I mean, they're all kinda close together, though. So.. Probably doesn't really matter.
Yeah.
Mm, maybe where the.. cases of whiskey are.
Um, loose-leaf paper. {VOC breath} Hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, don't really have any - I guess there's books. We could put it by that, maybe.
Uh, liters of water, probably down there where the juice was.
And then scissors, presumably where the paper and books are.
Hm.
Yeah, or the boating supplies there, yeah.
Hm, probably up with the jackets and sweaters.
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} 'Let's see. {PRN tsee} Uh, gas-powered cookstove.
Probably with the -
Yeah.
Um, bags of peat moss, um, I'd say that probably gonna go where - like, where pet food's gonna go. Maybe (just), like, garage, storage.
Um, heavy cable.
Hm, probably where the buckets and jugs are.
{VOC start} And then five-pound weights, {NVC} um, probably where the toys are. Maybe, like, the activities room or something.
Yeah.
Mm, probably put it down with the axes and power cords.
Lower left.
Yeah.. probably.
{VOC mouthnoise} Uh, it's right under the boat, there. Top - top left. Bundles of sticks.
Alright, let's do all four! {VOC breath} {NVC} Go crazy.
Uh, wetsuits.
Probably go with the boating supplies.
Electric heaters, um -
Yeah.
Socks, probably up with shoelaces and boots and so on.
And tow ropes, probably with heavy cable and buckets, 'and - {PRN n}
Yeah.
Well, {VOC breath} {NVC} I'm thinking the easiest.. {VOC mouthnoise} thing to do is to of-
Look for the weak spot in each column, look for the one thing that stands out as the 'most {PRN most-ch) negotiable. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} I mean, even though everything's important.
Football equipment?
Or cooking classes.
Yeah.
'I'm - {PRN ll- I'm} I'm thinking -
{VOC mouthnoise} In my mind, the things that you *can learn yourself at home -
Pretty easily, you know, through books or looking things up {VOC breath} in the library -
And the things you really *can't do on your own or- or at home.
I'm thinking, well, {QUAL high pitch} a person can learn to cook without a home economics class.
Their mothers can teach them, books can teach them.
Yeah.
Although, I'd *like to keep the 'juice {PRN joosh} machines in the long term for health reasons, but I can see -
I mean if it's - if it's between those or {QUAL lengthened} one of the tutors, you know, f- I certainly don't wanna get rid of the custodians or the math tutors, for example.
I'm *willing to negot- uh, to get rid of the football equipment, even though I know sports are a big money earner. {VOC start} Um -
Yeah.
Poetry books. Well -
If 'it's {PRN a-its} a choice between the poetry books and the acting*coaches, I'd keep the *coaches, because they're actually *teaching.. And the books are just books.
Yeah, that's true..
But it's - (??), again, it's what can they substitute, what can they do on their *own.. by going to a library or something? Well, they can read poetry on their own.
Can go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's see, I think - What would be the single most important thing? The math tutors?
If I could only pick, like, what's the single highest - what's the top funding list. For me, I guess it's the math tutors.
Also, I can - {VOC mouthnoise} I can see getting rid of the notetakers. Not that I wanna leave out.. {VOC start} those who are disabled, but I'm thinking they can just.. have a student next to them photocopy their notes -
Rather than having someone *else in there to take notes * for the disabled person. They can just get a copy of another student's notes.
So I'm willing to part with the notetakers, as well.
So! You wanna go to the next column? {VOC breath} Public health and safety. {VOC breath} Uh. {QUAL lengthened}
Uh, I don't know if that's -
Well - {VOC breath} hm.
If it gets to be *really bad - {VOC breath} 'but I - that's like, if I have to - well -
I think again, I can trade off more for the hospital additions.
*Weed control. I - I'd like to make that just the individual *homeowner's responsibility an-
Well - {VOC breath} for the public areas, maybe when we have more money in the budget.
No.
{VOC mouthnoise} 'Yeah. {PRN gyeah}
On a volunteer basis.
{VOC mouthnoise} I *really wanna keep the toxic waste disposal, though. We *gotta keep the public safe from that stuff.
Job training pays off a *lot in the long run, so -
What can we trade off? What can we g- well, the hospital additions we can.. wait on.
Yeah.
That's true.
Yeah.. Yeah, I think we've done enough there, then. I don't want to do too much compromising when it comes to health and safety in general, anyway.
Recreation and public services.
Hm, again, the community news ads are *nice, but I can - they can get their news from the radio. {VOC breath laugh} From.. other sources.
Buy a paper.
Soccer league is nice, but -
I'd rather be *feeding people.
Mm-hm.. {VOC mouthnoise} Put the money to *housing assistance.
Yeah.
I can - I can part with the public access station -
In order to -
Properly fund, you know, the soup kitchen and the -
Housing assistance and the food bank.
Let's see.
'Uh, {PRN nasalized (ae)} infrastructure and licensing.
I *really want the teaching 'certificates {PRN stificates} cuz we - we want good education infrastructure.
'The {PRN reduced vowel} speed limit signs are 'important. {PRN niportant}
Safety measure.
I can definitely part with the tattoo artist {QUAL laughing} licenses.
Uh -
{NVC} Yeah.
I don't 'think {PRN lengthened th} we need - {VOC breath}
Too many -
Towing services, again, people can call Triple A_.
I *do want pothole maintenance.
Subway system, I'm on the fence about. For those who use it, it's very important, but we already have buses.
I can definitely trade off the massage certificates and extra *taxi stops -
In order to have, say -
More *bus stops.
I'd rather have.. more bus upkeep, than the fishing licenses.
I can trade away the hunting tags in order to have more drainage ditches.. {VOC mouthnoise} I'm just thinking of the real nuts and bolts, keeping the city working stuff.
Yeah.
The massage certificates can go away. {VOC laugh}
Oh, I would get rid of both.
Oh! If we only get rid of three things, okay.
Oh! Okay.
Uh.. yeah, I - the - the three *low end things I could definitely get rid of would be -
The f- taxi stops -
The hunting tags, and the tattoo licenses.
Well actually -
{VOC start} The *massage certificates are gonna go firs- I'd get rid of the tattoos, the massages -
And -
'Yeah, {PRN nyeah} th- they do.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
It would - it would depend (??), I mean 'it {PRN wi} would vary from one area to the next.
(??) more rural, it would probably be -
But here we don't need hunting tags so much. So I can see (2x) of the hunting tags.
And I can see getting rid of the massage certificates, and then -
*Either the fishing or the tattoos. For *where we are, for the m- the metropolitan area. {VOC mouthnoise} For urban areas. Okay. We don't need the fishing licenses so much.
Well, I'm more focused on cheaper public transit. It's not that I have a *problem with taxi stops.
Uh, yeah. {QUAL reluctant} {VOC breath}
Yeah.
'And {PRN im} people can still get taxis at the - yeah. And they get - th- they get taxis in the most *important areas anyway. Just, like, *they would argue, well, we still have the most important bus stops. It's, like, yeah, *but, (they have) more people taking buses.
So I'd rather have more bus stops than more taxi stops. {VOC laugh}
The three to get rid of?
'Uh - {PRN diphthongal, moving to oh}
Well, tha- *if I'm limited to three, then I would probably, myself -
Want to get rid of -
Oh, I'd want to get rid of the hunting license, the fishing licenses -
And -
Probably the taxi stops.
Yeah. {QUAL muttering}
And the most important one to *keep, *I think, are the teaching certificates.
Definitely want a good teaching infrastructure.
Alrighty.. Is there more?
(Yeah).
Why, thank you!
I think on education, for me, it would be either -
Uh, f- juice machines.
Um -
'Is that {PRN izat} in there? Oh I didn't see that, yeah. Or- well, and acting coaches, I mean -
Th- the -
It seems to me th- th- that one's {VOC start} a *lot more longer term than just taking a cooking class and learning how to feed your own family, so it -
Would seem like that's a l- a lower priority.
Right, so maybe if we cut both that - cooking classes and the juice machines.
Hm. {VOC breath}
Right.
Oh, {QUAL nasalized} yeah, that's true.
H- 'yeah, {PRN eah} nuke it.. {VOC laugh} I'd say get rid of it.
Yeah, books are pretty cheap, though. Comparatively.
Hm, so - football -
Cooking classes and juice machines, then?
Mm. {VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise}
{VOC mouthnoise} Kay.
Yeah, I don't think weed control 'is {PRN z} high priority. {VOC breath} Uh, neighborhood watch support, I think I'd probably let them manage that themselves.
Um -
Yeah.
Um - {QUAL lengthened}
Yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
Um -
Right.
Yeah, I mean, that's three. Cuz if we do the additions and the weed control, neighborhood watch support, that's three.
Right, right.
Um -
Yeah.. I think my first thing to do would be to cut the stadium upkeep.
Right.
Um -
Uh.. pest control, I think I might be w-
Interested in that - getting rid of that, too, cuz that's usually -
Overhead spraying and things like that that aren't.. optimal.
Right.
May not be in Seattle.
'Um - {PRN æ-um}
Right.
Right.
Right.
So, if we get three, what would they be, then? Maybe fishing and hunting, and -
Uh -
Over taxi stops?
But then that's four things.
Well, cuz we've only been doing three on the 'lists. {PRN lis}
Right, cuz that - the (1x) -
But those - I mean, the flip side is that those allow people to.. start businesses.
Whereas.. a fishing license and a hunting tag is a much, much smaller -
They make money on them *too, but it's a much, much smaller.. person - I mean, they're f-
For better or for worse, there's far more tattoo parlors in town than there are hunters, probably.
Um -
So I mean, it - {VOC start}
Right.
Right.
Well what about taxi stops, though?
No, but I mean getting rid of that instead of massage or tattoo.
Because those aren't really -
A *taxi stop is just a - one more parking spot that doesn't get charged for.
Right?
Yell on the corner. {VOC breath} Right.
Right.
Right.
{VOC mouthnoise} So then, what would be the three, then?
Right.
{VOC mouthnoise} Cool.
Yeah, definitely.
Okay, l- 'why don't you {PRN w- unchoo} go first, let's see what you've got.
Face cream!
Um, {QUAL lengthened} yeah. Toilet paper -
Yeah.
(Go-) kinda toiletries an-
Toothpaste, and stuff like - okay, this is *buckets.
Siding? Yeah, th- kinda - uh, yeah. That makes sense.
Kinda -
Okay.
Beets? Food.
{VOC start} Oh. Soybeans! Yeah.
Yeah.
*Egg timers.
Appliance - well -
Eggs. How bout eggs (2x) - no, how bout egg timers next to the eggs?
Okay.
Heavy coats. Um - {QUAL very long} I don't see anything up there. 'Guess - {PRN guys} guess we gotta start a new one.
Okay.
Like, foo- I mean, yeah, so -

Box knives would go in the boa- boating supplies, siding, buckets, power cords -
Siding - {VOC breath}
Would you? Okay.
Huh. {NVC} {VOC breath}
Yeah.
We're back to the food section. Somewhere -
Uh-huh.
Well, ice cream is in frozen food, so -
Huh - (??).
So yeah, yeah.
Actually (you should probably start another one) cuz -
The way they work those is all the juices and all that, you wanna whole (??) - on - on a whole {NVC} aisle by themselves, usually, in the stores.
So if we move it up here -
Uh.
And *fish hooks goes with boating supplies.
Household, so - household stuff is - where's, uh - ?
That's it. Yeah, 'refrigerator {PRN refriger} magnets, yeah.
And the fishing net goes with fish hooks and boating supplies.
Yeah, there you go. Yep.
Bags of peat moss goes near -

You know, actually, the box knives probably belong up with the mousetraps.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. I don't see any gardening supplies here, though.
Yeah, start a new one down here.
Hm.
We got clothes he- somewhere. Heavy coats, yep.
Books of matches would go -
Household supplies. {QUAL lengthened} Yeah.
Where's our household supplies at?
I 'thought {PRN tot} we had a household supplies fu- department started. Yeah, that's where it is, right there!
Uh.
{VOC breath} Yep. {VOC breath}
Cases of whiskey.
Yeah. {VOC breath}
Yes, well, stuff to drink is just kind of a specialty - try this one down here.
But it's in the same aisle.
Uh - {VOC start} {NVC} {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
Scissors.
I guess.
Actually, it'd be more - wouldn't it - d- w- w- we had another section here of -
Stuff like that somewhere, I thought. No we don't. {VOC breath}
Yeah, that's where it goes. Yeah, yeah.
The same department.
Large cups.
Picnic supplies and stuff.
Hm.
Hm.
Pre-cut wood would go -
Household s- that would be household s-

Picnic stuff.
Sticks of butter. 'Oh, {PRN hoh} food, food, food.
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
Actually, five-pound weights would go in, uh - would go in, uh, physical fitness stuff, but we don't have a f- section for that.
Yeah it would.
Well, I don't know. If you're gonna catch whales.
{VOC breath} {VOC laugh} Flags.{SIL}
Flags. {VOC breath}
Somewhere between here and here.
Yeah, better.
'Yeah. {PRN huh-yeah} {NVC}
{VOC breath} {VOC breath} Hm.
Cushions for deck chairs. We're back to this stuff.
{VOC mouthnoise} We-
That would be with the, uh, siding and buckets and stuff.
Wetsuits would go up here.
'Yeah. {PRN ha} {VOC breath}
{VOC breath} {VOC breath} Yeah.
Where we got juices here? Yeah, it goes right with it, yeah.
And, let me see, small axes go up with this stuff here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Electric heaters -
Down by the power cords.
Finally got something to go with them.
We got the *face stu- yeah, there is, yeah.
And shoelaces go with - where's the f- (place) where - there they are.
{VOC hesitation} Right 'there. {PRN dere} {NVC}
Probably, yeah.
And paper bags would go - {VOC breath}
We don't have a check stand here.
Oh, picnic supplies!
Same thing. Right there, yeah.
And rolls of duct tape would go with this stuff here.
Like, right here maybe?
No.
We're down to these things again, here. Right there.
So - {QUAL lengthened}
Just arbitrarily {NVC} say -
(Three), four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten -
Fourteen.
Fourteen -
Four -
So, I wou- yeah. So, I would - I would say {VOC mouthnoise} four.. if you took f- uh, just arbitrarily, assuming that -
I- it *isn't that way, but ass- assuming they all equally got the same amount of money.
So if you made across the board cuts, as often happens, twenty five percent -
That would mean four - four items would have to be.. cut from each -
Each category, so - f-
Okay. So, let's go from -
Education and program-  *math tutors.
Okay. Assistant cooks.
Sex ed.
Custodians.
Speech therapy.
Football - {QUAL long f} (1x), that's one. Football equipment.
Kay, two.
Acting coaches.
Acting.
Acting, as in *drama coaches.
Yeah, it shou- should say drama.
I'm - I'm assuming. As opposed to someone -
Yeah. A fir- my first thought was - cuz it came after football, is a guy who's, uh - uh, just st- standing in - yeah, but that's - that would (1x), but -
Okay, so drama coaches. So would you keep a drama coach?
Poe-
Okay. Yeah.. Poetry books?
Uh, special ed teachers?
Cooking classes.
Okay. {VOC mouthnoise} That's three.
Notetakers, disability services. Ooh, I don't think you can do that.
Like, um -
{VOC start} Yeah, right.
Okay, bookkeeping class-
{VOC mouthnoise} Bookkeeping classes.
Oh, no.
Uh, you expect that at places like the fast food 'restaurants {PRN restrooms} because they have these buttons, but they don't actual- {VOC start} I mean, it's all done *for them, you know? They don't have to -
Yeah.
Okay, so that was four. Let's - so, let's go over the four that we - we - uh, kay. We said, um, {QUAL lengthened} speech therapy.
Football equipment.
Cooking classes, and, um -
{VOC start} Yeah, I - I'd agree with that.
You know. I'd - I'd have - yeah. Okay, so the next are public -
Health and safety.
(2x), job training, chicken pox vaccination, invasive species, S_T_D_ educatio-
Well let's take them in groups.
So, is there anything in the one, two, three, four, fi- six - of those six that you would get rid of?
Public health. This i-
Yeah.. Um -
I - I think public - uh, reproductive education, if - when it's done at the *county level -
Is providing, um - uh, education a-
{VOC mouthnoise} At the clinics.
That kind of stuff.. So.
Mm.
{VOC mouthnoise} I - I'd - I'd (2x) think about - uh, let's go th- th- anything else in that f- first group of six?
Okay. Toxic waste disposal - {QUAL lengthened} let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six - w- go down to veterans (1x). So, starting with toxic waste disposal -
Hospital additions.
Okay.. Needle exchange?
Well, that's *food inspection. Just food - just, in general.
Oh.
Nobody gets bagels.
Okay, shut them down, shut them down.
Okay.
Well, yeah.
Yeah, okay.
'Alright, {PRN aight} uh, needle exchange? Oh.
That'd be a tough one to cut.
Okay, sex offender database?
And veterans medical assistance?
Okay, so what do we got? We got two -
Uh, what was the other one.. that we said?
Reproductive education, okay.
Alright.
{VOC moutnoise} So, down to the last four. So we have two more to go.
F- uh, egg farm.. regulations.
Weed control.
Okay. That's three. Yeah, I'd agree with that one.
Okay. Of the f- three th- in that group - egg farm regulations, weed control, and pre-natal checkups.
Kay, let's go back up - 'let's {PRN thss} go to the top of the list, so just *one more.
Uh.. job training?
Boy.
All the voc ed teachers I know -
Ah, they would - they would -
Yeah.
Uh, invasive spe-
You know, I - I would hate -
Out of that list, I would go with the in- in {VOC hesitation} - cut out the invasive species removal.
Yeah.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
Uh - you know, you're - yeah, I know the- there's a problem with, uh, {QUAL lengthened} walnut trees, and with, um -
Certain apple trees - {QUAL lengthened}
And also with, um -
Uh, wh- let's see. There was a - another kinda tree.
S- walnut -
Oh. Didn't know about that one.
Okay. So we got - we got -
We got four.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Cuz you got reproductive education, and maybe {QUAL lengthened} that would cover that.
Okay.
Recreation and public services.
Okay.. Stray cat spaying.
Public news station.
Food bank.
Okay. *That's one, I agree with that one. Food {QUAL long f} bank - junior soccer league?
Okay.
Uh, kitten and puppy adoptions.
Soup kitchen?
Right.
Housing assistance?
Dog catcher.
Basketball club.
Though i- isn't that, uh, public - {VOC start}
Pu- uh - public, uh, news sta- so you would cut that. Okay.
'Reusable {PRN rusable} bag campaign? (I would) cut that.
That's four! Okay, veterinary hospital, pest control -
S- yeah, w- actually, w- those are the ones that we said before. Okay.
Infrastructure and licensing.
Mm-hm.
Uh-
Well, you know th- the *problem is, though -
Well, *I don't know how much of a problem it is now, but when I was teaching -
You had, uh, holes in your staff.
And, um, you couldn't find someone who was qualified -
In a certain ar- for example, to teach, uh, primary school.
So you have upper elementary, which is four through six -
But you needed a teacher who.. uh, you know.. uh, could do Kindergarten through - {PRN true}
Grade three, then *none of them are certif- no s-
Certified, so -
As an *emergency, what they would do is take a teacher from -
The *upper grades and move them down {NVC} to the lower grades.. Not a good idea, but it's done a- was done all the time. I think it's *still being done.
Yeah.
Yep.
Kay, speed limit signs. Need that. Right?
Additional bus - oh, we cut the bus stu-
Tattoo artist licenses?
Uh, boating licenses. That's - an- pu- (2x)?
Subway system.
Hunting tags, that's - {VOC start}
I- was that - when your car is towed, though -
Well, I know, but they - but you have - uh, de- there is some costs -
Well, like, al- uh, let's - let's - again, this is a hypothetical.
If they're - if, uh, the county is *providing that -
Then you would have to, uh -
Uh-huh.
Yeah.. so you would cut towing service-
Yeah, I don't know enough about that one to really (1x) - Massage certificates.
I have a friend who's a massage - she's a licensed therapist.
Yeah.. She - she is really - if you don't regulate that, what happens is it gets - it gets - goes sideways on you pretty fast.
Flagpole r- oh, we - {VOC hesitation} and taxi stops, we'd can that.
Fishing licenses, that's revenue. Upkeep -
Keep (that).. and drainage ditches. So, I think we had four. Di- yeah, that's four.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You kn- you know, the *reality - the reality of - of - cutting items is that *every single item on the budget -
Has {NVC} a constituency. {NVC}
You know. And - and the ones that you say, okay, let's say, it's.. *real obvious, flagpole repair -
Then the *veteran 'group {PRN grouf} would come *out of the woodwork and say *how can you desecrate the American flag? And (??) -
You know. I - and I mean, that's how it would g- uh, that's how it'd go. I mean, you know.
Ah - {QUAL lengthened} Actually, there *is - there i- there is a - there is a law about flying the flag in public buildings.
You ha- i- well, a *state law. Yeah. I - I don't - th- I don't think there's a federal law, but there is a state law.
But you have to do it.
So - but, if you *cut it - I mean, if it was something you could cut -
And you *cut it -
Nobody would come after you.
You know. There ar- there - there are laws out there that are *not enforced all the time.
Look at the marijuana laws -
{VOC laugh} Cracks me up. {VOC breath}
Okay, it's legal to have.. what, an ounce of marijuana on you.. Right? Whatever it is.
*But, it is illegal to buy it!
Now think about that for a second.
So where are you g- so - {QUAL laughing}
The only way - {VOC start} yeah.
The only way - uh, and people with medical marijuana are - were already covered.
You know, under the, uh - under the mar- {VOC start} medical marijuana.
So anyone who is not under that can carry, um, a - an ounce, or whatever it is, of marijuana.
But you can't buy it. You can't legally buy it. And *I just think that's really hilarious. 'And {PRN uh} they were talking about that in Colorado. It's the same problem.
That's the problem here, too.
Well, no, it's -
No, it's - it's bec- it's not drug dealers, per se. What they're - wh- th- w- th- w- what they're - uh, y- you can't do - th- the *problem is, because -
It's a controlled substance under federal -
Yeah.
Right. I- it's not the m-
Well, yeah. An- so, you need to change the law.. at the federal level.
We'll see. We'll see. You know, 'it's {PRN s} gonna be interesting.
Yes and no. They've - uh, the problem is, all of the banks currently in the state of Wa- we've done away pretty much with state regulation.
You'd have to institute a whole new set of laws.
Cuz all of them are - you know, the - F_ - i- if the Feds are involved - F_D_I_C insured, or -
Uh, k- uh, kim- uh, what is it, credit union? Uh, {VOC start} you know, that's all federal regulation, so if they're at *all regulated by the Feds in *any way, shape, or form -
They wo- they won't touch it. It was a bank, uh, th- in, uh, Seattle -
That was willing - you know, the bank president said (??) our board, they're - they're willing to be the bank, and then they reneged about a week later. They said no, we can't do it because of the c- controlled substance for the federal - We would lose our license, an-
{VOC breath} Of *course they did!
{NVC} They - th- {NVC} that was one o- yeah, that was {NVC} one of the - that was one of the *basic issues in the campaign. You know? Uh, I mean, *against it was -
Was that, um, you know, it's a violation of the federal law.
Then we went ahead and did it {NVC} anyway.
Yeah. It's regulation by the state. That's - that's right.
But - you know - the *problem is, like the- they were saying in Colora- oh, it's true in this state too, but they - they, uh - you know -
Y- you pay your - 'your employee - {PRN yrmployee}
And you're gonna pay them, uh, six hundred dollars. It's a- it's all cash.
That's *crazy.
That is so crazy!
Anyway.
I'm just looking here to see what - see - see what I can see on - on the list where I - where - where I - uh, that I figure -
The list that I figure is the least important is the one I wanna 'get {PRN nugget} the number from.
Which is recreation and public services.
I think.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, so let's cut four.
Well.. that's - that's - that's a borderline. We'll see what happens with the rest of it. {VOC mouthnoise}
That's also borderline. See what happens with the rest of it.
Keep it.
Keep them.
Cut it.
Cut -
Cut it.
The, uh, 'the alumni {PRN thalumni} will pay for it.
Yes. Drama coaches, yes.
Hm.. huh. {VOC breath}
That's what *I'm a- yeah.
Yeah. {VOC breath}
Just staying there for a while, yeah.. yeah.
Uh, yes, {QUAL lengthened} I believe I would. We got two gone already, don't we? Huh.
{VOC start} (2x) - d- yeah, we keep them.
Keep them.
{VOC breath} Huh.
Um - {VOC breath}
Can them.
Oh.
I don't think so either.
Sugar-free juice machines, we can can those. We talked about that. Yeah, let's get rid of those because they don't make any money.
That's not a Pepsi machine.
I think in today's world, uh, with, uh, the number of kids that *can't *count -
That are out there wandering around now - I had a bank teller who couldn't count, by the way. About three weeks ago, yeah. I had to 'tell {PRN tol} her - tell her (1x) she can't count.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's what they s- that's what they thought in the - think in the bank, too, but when they're sitting there and (they) actually counting money in front of you -
You know, that's when it gets - that's when it gets tense.
Hm.
Yeah, okay.
Speech therapy's gone, 'football {PRN footfall} equipment's gone -
Uh, the cooking classes are gone. {VOC breath}
And the, uh, sugar-free machines are gone.
Okay.
{VOC start} Yeah.
Reproductive education, job training programs, chicken pox vaccinations, (??) - {QUAL trailing off to mumbling}
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} I don't think we can remove any of those, actually. Reproductive education I'd put on the line, because it's - it's - it's - it's not necessary -
To, uh - {VOC breath}
Immediate -
D- uh - {VOC hesitation} 'uh - {PRN yuh} the uh- the immediate lack of - a lack of that won't affect the public health.
Huh. {VOC breath}
Yeah, that's it. Uh, yeah. (But) I think it's uh, 'you know {PRN yo}, basically it's - it's one of those things where if we *don't have it it's not going to really affect the public health and safety immediately.
Um - {VOC breath}
Oh.
Yeah. That's just a - on the list. No, nothing else.
{VOC breath} {VOC breath} Okay, we'd ha- probably have to - if we have to make cuts and they're spending too much money, uh, b- bagel factory inspections.
What do we need bagel factory inspections for?
Yeah.
Well, j- no, just bagel factories, it's obviously what it says, so that must be what it is.
So can that!
I know. {VOC breath} Well {VOC hesitation} 'yeah, {PRN yah} 'yeah, {PRN yah} well, the thing is - the thing is, is when you - when you make a bagel, what are you making, you know? Cooked bread.
{VOC start} How you gonna screw that up?
Course, you *could do what McDonald's did. McDonald's got caught putting too much wood pulp in their hamburger buns in Iowa.
Yeah, 'was {PRN ws} about twenty years ago. {QUAL laughing}
Yeah, I can't cut that.
Nope.
Veterans medical 'assistance {PRN excistance} is - uh, the United States government does that, so cut that. That not a county deal!
Huh.
Uh, the other one was, uh, reproductive education.
Hm..{SIL}
Neighborhood watch support can go. Now we gotta find *one more. *One more, we gotta go.
I wanna keep all thr- I *wanna keep all three of those. If anything had to go, well -
Yeah.
Job training programs!
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah. {VOC breath} I - I - I - (??) - 'yeah, {PRN yah} the thing is we need to have them, because we got too many - too many kids that don't have any skills.
Uh - {VOC breath}
Well right now we've got, uh, let me see, there's a, uh - there's a, uh - uh.. a bug that is going around removing *all deciduous trees in the United States.
Would you want them to not do that and lose *all of the trees in Washington.
Yeah. {VOC mouthnoise}
{VOC breath} {VOC breath} Yeah.
And there's a thing that's killing fir trees also.
Running around, yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
{VOC mouthnoise} So we can't get rid of that.
So, 'let {PRN l} me see, S_T_D_ educa- let's get rid of the education one. The S_T_D_ education (we'll) get rid of.
Okay.
Right.
Huh.
{VOC breath} Okay.
Public news station -
I'd can the news station.
I'd have to get rid of that.
I'd keep that.
Soup kitchens, I'd probably keep. But I'm kind of against them, but 'I {PRN bai} think, you know, at certain times of the year we have to ha- do something.
Yeah, absolutely have to have that. {VOC breath}
Yeah, have to have that. We can can the basketball club.
Yeah, pi- the public access station, we have no business doing it in the first place, so can that.
The cable company's required to pay for that by law!
Yeah.
Yeah, cut that because you don't need a campaign. That's four!
Okay.
Yeah.
Teacher certificates, I am absolutely - in fact, I'm, uh, I'm - I'm all for, uh - for making sure that, uh -
That they hold a certificate in the class in which they are teaching, because we got too many teachers who are putting classes they're not qualified to teach.
Uh, at least in Seattle.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Could do Kindergar- through three.
Hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Hoo. {VOC breath} Yeah, well it shouldn't be *ever done. Uh -
Course, you know, that comes right down - that comes right down to the root thing, is, 'you know {PRN yo}, why do we spend so much money on certain things and *not enough money on things that really matter, like.. education
Um - {VOC breath}
Yeah.. Yeah, we have to have those.
No, we cut the additional bus stops.
Gotta have those.
Gotta have those.
Pothole maintenance, *absolutely have to have.
(Well, you) gotta pay for that.
Yeah.
Towing services, um.. the government shouldn't be paying for towing services.
You have to pay the towing service.
Then part of the cost - th- part of the cost of the towing should go to the county. From the, uh - from the - the towing service should be - should be taxed by the county -
Per, uh - per instance for the amount that th- cost the county to take care - to deal with it.
Uh, so I would - towing services, yeah.
Yeah.
Um - {VOC breath}
Yeah, th- I think they need to be licensed, yes.
Hm.
Huh.
Yeah, it does.
Oh, can that.
Yeah.
Keep that.
Bus stops, keep that.
You have to have those.. 'Yeah, that's {PRN yats} four! Yeah. (??) sixteen of 'them. {PRN m} Alright. They're done!
Yes.
That's right.
Then you're gonna have - yeah, 'then they're {PRN thnthey} gonna be out there yelling atcha.
Say I'm not desecrating, I'm just not gonna fly it.
Yeah.
Yeah.. (I'd look) out and say find me a public law that says I have to fly the flag.
We'll just take them all down, here, and, uh, you can fly them in your yard.
You *have to fly it?
Oh, okay.
No, I don't think so either, no.
Hm.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it, yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
Huh.
Huh.
I guess, yeah.
Yeah.
Huh.
Huh.
Yeah.
Medical marijuana law, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Huh.
Well, they can't! There's a {NVC} federal law against banks dealing with drug dealers.
And since it's against a federal law -
That's it! Yeah, it's a - it's the drug laws of the United States, and it - so - {VOC breath} and they can't take the money from it. So -
Huh.
And they're tr- they're doing that now. They're working on it.
Huh.
Huh.
Well, we can have state banks that aren't federally controlled, that, uh, would deal in the stuff. {VOC breath}
Oh.
Yeah.. 'oh {PRN yo} yeah.. yeah.
Huh.
That's right. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Huh.. Yeah.. Huh.
Yeah.
No. No.
Yeah.
Yep.
Well 1
Any more -
Yeah.
Yeah.
Alright. {NVC}
Face cream! Face cream. {VOC breath}
Well, no, {QUAL laughing} I - I wouldn't put that there.
Uh, how bout, um -
Toilet paper, yeah, probably.
Cushions for deck chairs.
Where'd you put those?
Mm.. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not - uh, I put it closer to the 'direction {PRN rection} of mousetraps, I'd say.
Beets, beets. Food.
Yeah.
Backpacks.
Backpacks I'd probably put -
With the toys and 'refrigerator {PRN refriderator} magnets, would you say? Or, no, boating supplies and travel guides, tha- that makes more sense.
I think it'd be better if we put it by travel guides. I mean -
Mm-hm.
Well obviously I -
Yeah, yeah.
Books of matches.
{VOC start} Uh - hum.
Probably with the, uh - p- f- f- camping supplies, I'd say.
Backpacks.
Yeah.
Suppose so.
Hm
Well, they (??) - need to be with clothes, but clothes aren't anywhere here.
How bout just over n- in this general area?
Mm.
Small saws.
Probably up with the 'boating {PRN budding} supplies, would you say? Power cords?
Yeah, but s- {VOC mouthnoise}
{VOC mouthnoise} I 'suppose {PRN spose} so.
I was 'thinking {PRN thing} 'this is {PRN thizI} more of a home - home improvement thing, but -
{VOC mouthnoise} Alright, how bout a-
H- how bout 'near {PRN new} the siding, then? {VOC breath}
Yeah.
Hm.
Yeah, {QUAL high pitched} yeah.
Books.
I think I'd put the books around the thick -
Sweaters, but - no, near the toys. Right next to the toys, would you say?
Yep, yep.
'Electric {PRN lectric} heaters.
Probably.. with the power cords.
Mm-hm.
Bundles of sticks.
Next to books of matches?
Mousetraps.
'Yeah. {PRN nyeah}
{VOC start} 'Near {PRN nyeah} the 'heaters? {PRN heatahs}
Mm-hm.
{NVC} Small axes.
Near the small saws.
'But {PRN buh} is there room?
{VOC start} Yeah.
Up there.
'Liters {PRN litahs} of water.
Uh, I think it'd *also go up there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Or maybe it go down here, with the food.
Nah.
F- f- and besides, f-
Yeah, and f- and food, i- any case - othe- I think we assume the people have running water.
Probably up there as well.. I'd think.
Maybe a bit further up?
Yeah.
Box knives.
Small axes, small saws? Box knives.
Food.
Yeah, yeah.
Bags of peat moss.
Hm.
Up there?
Alright, yeah! Yeah, yeah.
Yep, and thick sweaters.
Bars of soap.
Near face cream and toilet paper, of course.
Yeah, {QUAL slightly lengthened} yeah, yeah.
Mint toothpaste. Near the s- toiletry area.
Probably down by the pet food?
Hm. Alright, yeah. Makes sense.
'Uh, I don't {PRN ah-oh} know, I don't have any pets.
My sister does, though, and.. they are a - {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
Nuisance.
Boxes of doughnuts?
Yep.
Dried figs. With {QUAL devoiced} beets.
Hats.. Also there.
Next to eggs?
Mm.
Down there with pet food?
Yeah, yeah.
Buckets.
Buckets would go down with box knives.
Yeah.
Bagels?
Bagels with eggs.
Always good way to start breakfast.
Heavy cable.
Down with power cords.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Flags. With books.
Hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Man, that left column is.. really full.
{VOC mouthnoise} And the right column is - {VOC breath} (3x) empty.
Socks.
Right there.
With {QUAL devoiced} fleece-lined boots. Shoelaces, face cc-
Yep, yep.
Rolls of duct tape?
{VOC mouthnoise} Ah, just put it here. There's more room here.
True.
Cases of whiskey.
I think we should put it with junk foods.
Yep, yep.
Bottles of juice. Near the whiskey.
Five-pound weights.
Is there any *space in the left column?
'Suppose {PRN spose} so.
{VOC start} Mm. {VOC breath}
{VOC start} Yeah, m- maybe.
Well, {VOC start} I think we should probably put it in the, um, middle column now.
There's barely any space in the left column.
Scissors.
Mm-hm.
{VOC mouthnoise} Alright!
Yeah.
Maybe this is R_E_I_?
Mm.
Alright, so I'm just gonna draw {NVC} some of these at {NVC} random.
I've got face cream.
{VOC breath} I think next to *ice cream is the obvious - naw, no no no.
Probably near toilet paper, right? Alright.
{VOC breath} Throw it on.
I {QUAL lengthened} would probably maybe put that near sort-of, uh, the siding area? Like, it's a home improvement -
Thing.
Uh yeah, I might put it *across from siding.
Or down there. Yeah, whatever.
Beets. {NVC}
Food probably, maybe by soybeans. That seems sort of a producey -
{VOC mouthnoise} I would have a backpack near trave- but again also by toys, that's tough.
Yeah, cuz you're back- (??), makes sense you're {NVC} backpacking.
Yeah.
Alright, I've got sticks of butter.
Probably put that in between eggs and cake mix.
Yeah. Do we have, uh - ? I guess we have boating supplies.
Maybe by *mousetraps, though.
Sort of a thing you'd keep around your house?
This is gonna be, like, a jumbly-ass store at some point. {VOC laugh}
Thick sweaters.
We start a new clothes section, yeah, that's what I was thinking.
This is - I'll put it, like, right there.
That's now our clothes section. {NVC}
Well, I mean, (2x) like power cords is sort of a *tool.
We're sort of having tools, like, we could do -
But you might use a saw.
Yeah, okay. Like, put it right - right in here?
Alright, cool.
Canvas bags.
I'd probably put that near boating supplies.
{NVC} Yeah, sure. Yeah.
I've got some loose-leaf paper, I think that could go along with refrigerator magnets and books area.
I'd probably say down by power cords, tools-ish.
Heavy coats. {VOC breath}
Could probably go right next to thick sweaters.
Yeah, maybe - like, 'we could have {PRN w k av} books of matches, small saws, bundles of sticks.
I've got half-inch tubing, that's kind of a home improvement-y tool-ish thing.
Yeah, maybe, like, right 'in between {PRN nbetween} here?
It can sort of - in this area.
Generally.
I've got wetsuits.
I thin- I think boating supplies is the answer.
Yeah, (it's) sort of, like - like, sort of camping.. travel.
And usually in a grocery store, like, the bottled water's in it's own area.
Yeah. {NVC}
Uh, pre-cut wood?
I think.
I'm th- I'm thinking maybe near bundles of sticks.
Okay.
Yeah, sorta have it around tools-ish.. area.
Pouches of oatmeal -
I think I'd put near cake mix, it's sort of a *dry good.
Oh, but maybe also camping - well, it's there now.
Yeah, I guess tha- it's kinda, like, a h- I think maybe, like, right here. It's (kinda), like, a home improvement thing. For your *garden.
Think light jackets can probably go right by heavy coats.
Yeah.
I've got chocolate bars.. I think sort of near sugar and ice cream, I think this is, like, the sugary -
Yeah.
Cans of peas?
I'm thinking maybe by soybeans?
'I'm {PRN m} not really sure what pet food kinda goes with.
Like, what's - {NVC} at a grocery store, what is pet food {NVC} usually with?
'Yeah. {PRN nyeah}
Yeah. Junk food.
I've got *fish hooks.
Think boating supplies.
Mm-hm.
Large vests.
(Can) continue to be in the clothes section.
'Yeah. {PRN nyeh}
Egg timers?
I think maybe -
We- y- egg timer's not really *for eggs, though. It's, like, a cake - 'just {PRN jz} like a - just a general kitchen timer.
'Yeah, {PRN myeah} why not?
'It's not {PRN snot} really a *food, {NVC} it's sort of, like, {NVC} a - {NVC} mm, sort of pet food, kitchen items -
Area.
'Or I guess, {PRN are guess} yeah, sorta general items.
Sure.
Shoelaces, I guess, is, uh.. clothing?
I would say so.
Fleece-lined boots.
Hm. {VOC start} Gas-powered cookstoves?
'That {PRN at} seems like a camping sorta thing, doesn't it?
S- put it up by backpacks?
Tow ropes. Probably with boating supplies.
Yeah. {VOC breath}
'We {PRN w} might not be the best managers in the world - {VOC breath} tell you the truth.
Mm. {QUAL rising pitch}
Think, uh.. {VOC start} paper bags, along with, like, pet food and egg timers?
Really *anywhere in this column, it could go. {VOC breath}
Yeah.
You would use duct tape (2x) maybe if your stove breaks down.
Fishing net.
Gonna.. sorta wedge that in there.. Probably shoulda gone closer to the boat.
{VOC laugh} Okay. {QUAL laughing}
I've got large cups. I think along with paper bags?
Yeah. 'I'm gonna {PRN imuhnuh} put package of cookies up here between chocolate bars and ice cream.
{NVC} I mean, I'd put it, like, right here, fishing net. You might use some weights for your fishing trip.
This is sorta just your outdoorsy area. {VOC breath}
I might *also put over there.
Well where - where - where w- you think about empty p- like, it's an empty jug.
Okay.
By {NVC} the - 'yeah. {PRN k-nyeah} Sorta there, toiletries-ish.
Or up there, yeah.
Tweezers.
I w- put -
Right there. And, uh, that's it! {VOC breath}
That's our store! There's *not a lot of food in our store.
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah, I mean - {VOC breath}
I think we should take out the bookkeeping classes.
And the 'cooking classes.
And the -
Well, I mean - I don't 'want - {PRN whan} d- {VOC hesitation} ah- {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
Maybe we sh- we should remove the football equipment?
Alright, I suppose.
True, true.
{VOC start} 'What about {PRN whabut} the sugar-free juice machines?
Mm-hm.
Unfortunately. {VOC breath}
One.
Alright!
Or in university.
Ah, I'd keep that, but I - 'that's {PRN ts} only because I h- like poetry.
Ah, w- w- we're horrible aren- a- a- at this, aren't we? {VOC laugh} {VOC breath}
So much partial to um - b- I'm being (somewhat) partial, but -
Alright.
Mm-hm.
'Yeah. {PRN byeah}
Yep.
Yep.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Alright, so I think we're just cutting three things from each one. {VOC hesitation}
Mm-hm. Assistant cooks.
And acting coaches.
Mm-hm.
(Now for) public health and safety.
We should probably keep reproductive education.
Well, *yes, but this is, I suppose -
Yeah, and then sex ed is for - I think is for high school. This is - {VOC breath} {VOC hesitation} Yeah.
(We should) definitely keep that.
K- keep.
Invasive (species removal) we should also keep.
S_T_D_ education, also keep.
Yep.
Hm.
Or maybe it's just New York, and everyone eats bagels anyway.
Yeah.
Definitely.
Mm-hm.
Weed control we can get rid of.
Yeah.
Pre-natal checkups.
'Neighborhood {PRN neighbwood} watch support.
Why? {VOC breath}
Yeah, but police can oftentimes be somewhat, uh -
(How I) say, heavy-handed.
True.
{VOC start} I - I - I wouldn't know enough ab- about that, but let's just go with that for the s- f- for the sake of argument.
Yeah.
Let's see -
Hm. Football stadium upkeep.
Well, I mean - uh, this is 'basically {PRN basely} - this is mostly based on my own personal biases, but I'd say football stadium upkeep -
Junior soccer league -
And.. boy's basketball club.
I- I suppose. I mean - they'll probably take out their - their a- vengeance s- on some s-
On some - {VOC hesitation} on someone else if they di- {VOC breath}
If do that.
Uh, how bout -
Alright, I suppose.
Yeah, yeah yeah.
And keep pest control and public 'access {PRN aka} station and public news p- station.
Maybe we should just, uh -
Get rid of the s-
Hm. What about th- free cat spaying?
{VOC mouthnoise} Alright.
I see.
I suppose.
Alright, {QUAL laughing} alright.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Alright.
{VOC start} Which one is the public (1x) access here? Is -
Oh.
Yeah, yeah. Agreed, agreed.
Though, I - (3x) - though I *do love our so- s- our local n- um, o- our local stuff, for example, there was - {VOC hesitation} uh, you ever saw Almost Live?
*Really funny. It's {VOC hesitation} *really really funny.
Yeah, 'but it's {PRN buts} funnier than S_N_L_.
Ah, but this (was in the) the nineties. Back when S_N_L_ use-
N- now the person o- who -
Person - the people who run it are now running this new show, the two oh six. {QUAL rising intonation} Not, r- nearly as good, I'd say.
It's - it's not - it's nothing much, I mean, I thin- I - I - I - I just think they're out of practice. They m- they might get better soon.
Well, and the other person is now on the Seattle channel. {QUAL rising intonation}
Uh, Nancy Guppy?
Uh, she's running an art zone.
Ye- you ever seen that?
Mm.
Oh, cool!
Cool, cool.
I'm jealous now.
Mm-hm.
Infrastructure and licensing.
Well, {VOC hesitation} I- I'd (2x) k- I- I'd like to keep the bu- the bus stops and -
The, um.. subway system and so on.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
H- how bout, um -
Taxi stops?
{VOC mouthnoise} Yeah.. yeah.
Taxi stops, um, flagpole repair, and what about, um -
Pothole maintenance?
Nah.. Pothole maintenance needs to be there.
Yeah, yeah yeah.
I know, I know. {VOC breath} {VOC breath}
Pothole maintenance was probably good to keep.. 'How about {PRN howp} massage certificates?
Tattoo artist license might be a bit more, um, useful, if only because -
You're (cutting) something into somebody's *skin.
{VOC start} Uh - {VOC breath}
Yeah, it's better to ha- to -
Than having an unlicensed 'tattoo {PRN tatatoo} artist.
Mm-hm.
Alright.
So let's start with educations and {NVC} programs.
Well -
Those are both good things.
Maybe. I mean, I think - {VOC hesitation} bookkeeping classes, you know, that's important. That's basically accounting, that's - teaching people how to manage their money, that's good for the community.
Um -
Yeah, those could probably go.
I mean -
Our kids are gonna be fat no matter what.
'Alright, {PRN aigh} what, uh - let's see, I think we hafta -
How many have we cut so far?
Cut sugar-free. Alright.
Uh, maybe c- we could cut acting coaches?
That seems like something that people could do privately.
Yeah, an-
See, poetry books could probably also go.
Okay, I mean, yeah, I -
Assistant cooks.
I think that could probably go.
Um -
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC mouthnoise} I would say keep math tutors.
*Definitely keep sex ed.
Keep custodians, speech therapy.
Uh, special ed teachers, definitely keep.
Notetakers, keep.
I would say keep music teachers, you know. Art's important.
So we - wha- what's, uh - cut, uh, sugar-free juice machines -
Assistant cooks.
And acting coaches.
Alright, three things. We can do this.
I mea- it's the same as sex ed, isn't it?
But it can't hurt to have two, honestly. {VOC laugh}
Oh, okay, 'this is {PRN this} for adults.
Yeah, okay. Fair enough, fair enough.
Job training programs.. we 'should definitely keep. Chicken pox vaccinations we should probably keep.
Yeah. We should *definitely keep toxic waste disposal.
Uh, hospital *additions?
Well, le- let's c- let's come back to that one. I think we can get rid of the bagel factory inspections.
Just {QUAL laughing} cuz -
If it was, like, factory inspections in general, we should keep that, but specific to bagel factories seems like a weird targeted, almost anti-'Semitic - {PRN simetic}
Government thing to be funding. {VOC breath}
{VOC laugh} Just. {QUAL laughing} There's more food than bagels.
Uh, I 'would {PRN w} say keep needle exchange.
Uh, d- keep the sex offender database.
Keep 'veterans {PRN veter-rans} medical assistance.
Yeah. Like, say, we're d- we're dumping bagel factory inspections and weed control.
Uh, egg farms regulations?
I don't know what those *are, but, I mean, it probably wouldn't hurt to keep them.
That's people's food.
I would say yeah, keep that. It's a public health -
*I would get rid of neighborhood watch support.
Presumably you already have police.
Yeah, but neighborhood watch support I feel a lot of time is just people spying on their neighbors.
{VOC mouthnoise} Okay, so is that three?
Alright.1+
Recreation, public services.
Let's just.. do a quick scan, see if anything can just go from, like the get go. {VOC breath}
I *like most of these. {VOC start} Um -
I - I - I - I would be with you on the football stadium upkeep, just cuz it already exists, but I wouldn't wanna cut the {NVC} sports {NVC} clubs. {NVC}
I think maybe kitty an- kitten and puppy adoption could be he- done by a private charity.
'Doesn't necessarily need to {PRN doesnessarily ndo} be run by the city.
Um -
Definitely keep housing assistance and soup kitchens and food banks.
So if we *have a public *news station, I'm not sure if we need a public *access station?
Well -{VOC breath}
I'm *for that, personally.. But that's cuz I used to live in Seoul, that has a huge stray cat problem.
And I'm *very much in favor of getting rid of, like, more stray cats.
I don't want them to keep making more.
Like, those things are *loud.
{VOC start} And they're gross. {QUAL laughing}
Alright, so b- wha- so we got football stadium upkeep -
Uh, kitten and puppy adoption.
I- I- my vote is public access if we already have public news. {VOC mouthnoise} I've seen the public access channel. It's a lot of *weird stuff that *is *not particularly helpful. {VOC breath}
I don't remember the number, but it's just, like, a bunch of people can get on, have their own shows. There's one guy who's been running a Kurt Cobain was murdered show for like ten years now.. and {QUAL laughing} it's - it's *funny, but it's not -
If it was keep that or keep P_B_S_, I'm keeping P_B_S_ every single time.
Alright, so -
Uh, I've heard of it, but I've never actually seen it.
It's, like, our local S_N_L_ sketch comedy sort of n- thing?
'It's not {PRN tsnot} hard to do.
Okay, it was har- it was hard to do, then. Back then it was good.
{VOC mouthnoise} Haven't heard of it.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
No, but I - I know who she is. Um.. she comes to some of the stuff at Meany Hall.
To do reviews of it, I guess.
Yeah.
{VOC start} I've never seen her, just know the name. {VOC breath} I mean, maybe I have. I wouldn't know.
Alright, so.
Yeah, infrastructure licensing, um -
Yeah. Um -
Maybe flagpole repair?
We could cut some space there.
They seem pretty tough.
Yeah, I mean I guess you c- you can - these days, you just *call a taxi.
Naw, I would keep - I mean, if you've ever been to Spokane, you wanna know about keeping pothole maintenance. {QUAL laughing on 'maintenance'}
{VOC start} They di- they got rid of that and it's a nightmare. {VOC breath}
Maybe w- {VOC hesitation} yeah, I was gonna say that, or more, tattoo artist licenses.
Yeah, I guess they should be licensed.
And not just random folks.
I'd say if you're having an unlicensed masseuse, it's less dangerous.. That's a good point.
Alright, yeah. So I say we cut massage, uh, flagpole, and taxi stops.. all there right in a row.
Alright, cool!
Budget solved.
Okay.
And bundles of sticks.
Yeah th- i- That makes sense.
Okay, and bundles of sticks, I would think, maybe by siding, boating supplies. Okay, so think there?
Kay.
Okay. {VOC breath} {NVC}
Yeah.
Okay, and we have loose leaf paper. {VOC mouthnoise} Hm.
Toilet paper but it's - it's kind of a different -
Maybe it would fall s- somewhere in between -
Like a toiletry product, and then like a household product.
Okay.
So let's see here.{QUAL breathy}
Should we put it on this side?
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath} Okay, how far down?
In the middle, okay.
{VOC mouthnoise} Food.
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, or be by -
Soybeans?
Yeah.
Okay, paper bags.
Thinking probab- Oh.
Maybe -
Two.
Or th- Or one.
What do you think?
Yeah -
Where's the check-out?
Good point.
'Uh.{PRN long}
Okay, I - Maybe -
Maybe by food items?
If that's what - Is that what you're thinking when you think paper bags?
It's an odd item.
Yeah. {VOC breath}
Okay, so would we say that would be more a of- a- a, like food -
Type of category, or put it -?
In two.. Okay.
So let's 'see{PRN long vowel}
Say, maybe more towards - .. Down here?
Okay, how bout there? Okay.
This is gonna get interesting.
(Okay, now - ) {QUAL muttering}
Okay.
Oh, yeah!
Perfect.
Okay, empty plastic jugs.
Um.
{VOC breath} Have to - Yeah, okay.
(Lets) do that.
'Ah. {QUAL lengthened}
Yeah, like sweets? {VOC breath}
Okay.
It's true.
Alright. .. 'Bagels. {PRN long s}.. Okay.
Would you rather put this one down by -
Like, the dried foods, or maybe - since it's a bread, maybe by cake mix?
Maybe lean towards, like, the middle of the aisle. .. Okay.
S- do that.
Hats!
Oh, wow.
Looks like we needs a - {VOC start} an apparel section.
They didn't leave us any this time.
Y- Yeah {QUAL laughing}
Yeah.
Yeah.
A travel hat.
Yeah. It looks - Looks good. Okay, sticks of butter. .. Okay. .. Definitely food.
{VOC breath} Yeah.
Yeah, let's do that.
Yeah.
Cool.
'Ah.{PRN long}
Hm. {VOC breath}
Maybe - Maybe up here, by refrigerator magnets.
Okay.
Uh-oh. .. Face cream.
Where -?
Yes. .. Maybe on this side? Okay.
Good call. {VOC breath}
{VOC mouthnoise}  Oo.
Oh, man I would think two again. {QUAL breathy}
Yeah.
So, (I'd) - Okay, boxes of donuts, okay.
By the bagels?
Maybe here? .. Okay. {NVC}
(1x) Chocolate bars.
Hm -
Could 'either {PRN long final syllable} I would think either go down here .. by some of the dry foods, or, like, up -
C- Uh- I'm thinking the -
Quaker Oatmeal pouches, like -
Which I'd put more up towards like a sweet -
Yeah.
Seems good. Okay. Half inch tubing.
This looks like, uh, aisle one.
Let's see, maybe by 'the {PRN long} .. bundles of sticks?
{VOC mouthnoise} Light jackets.
Yeah. Yeah.
Makes sense.
Beets.
Okay, maybe above soybeans?
Should we put them next to our -?
'Ah {QUAL long}, that's the trick.
Uh, maybe, let's say fresh since they don't say. So -
Yeah, maybe here? .. Okay.
Oh -
Okay, let's see.
Miscellaneous item -
Wow.
The two places I'm seeing that would make the most sense in my head would be down here. .. Or by these -
Items.
Okay.
Okay, scissors -
Yeah. Okay let's 'see {QUAL lengthened} -
What do you think?
Down? Kay.
Okay. {VOC breath}
Okay.
Now we have choices. So -
(I) could - We could put it by our scissors.
That would probably make the m- make sense.
Okay, cans of peas.
Canned food.
I guess (they aren't - )
Down here?
Okay.
Let's do that.
Water. {QUAL whispering}
Lots of options on this one.
What are you thinking?
Possibly, like in this area?
(Course) then we have all, like, our -
Food and -
We'll have different types of, like I- I'm assuming we'll have the juice and -
So {VOC breath} .. This'll probably go together.
This is turning into an awesome store.
Actually could almost go over here too.
How bout right above .. empty plastic jugs?
Okay.
Buckets.
Oh, buckets, okay.
Well we've got -
We've got some, like -
Let's see here.
So it could go, maybe in this area, or by the boating supplies and fishing net?

'Hm{PRN long} -
Let's see, I guess -
Could do it up at the very top. .. Okay.
(Kay.)
Oh no!
This is a space, right?
Well, I guess it could go, like under .. tow -
ropes. Or by the axes, or whatever.
Yeah.
Socks.
Oh man, okay.. Do we.. use it in our last little -?
Space right here?
Or would it be okay to put our socks down somewhere else?
Do you think we'll have shoes?
We have shoe laces.
Maybe down here? {VOC breath}
Yeah.. Okay.
Okay.
'Um{PRN long vowel}. {VOC breath}
Hm.
Certainly depends on what type of flag they are.
Like having that makes me think it has to do something with, like a {NVC} wave down flag, or -
Not like a national flag, but who knows?
Could be.
I guess if that was the case -
Maybe somewhere down here.
Yeah, either or. It's kind of an odd one.. Okay.
Bottles of juice.
Oo. {VOC breath}
Okay, what are you thinking? Cuz we have our liters of water.. You wanna put it there?
Okay.
Yeah, I guess so.
Heavy cable. .. Oo, tow ropes.

Alright!
That aisle is awesome.
These ones are a little sad.

Maybe they're kids backpacks.
Alright.
Oh no.
Yeah.
Pre-cut wood.
Mm!
Yeah.
Cushions for deck chairs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, should we just pick a number?
How does -? 'Uh{PRN long} -
Maybe we can cut half.
(??) One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen - Okay, I've got seven.. (Region) Alright.
Education and programs.
So we have -
Math tutors - {VOC breath}
Um -
Tutors.
Maybe.
I'd say that one's kinda on the fence.
Okay, assistant cooks.
Maybe. No. No. {VOC laugh} Sex ed.
That seems pretty important.
Um.. Custodians.
I would say that's important too.. Okay, so those tow are keepers.. Speech therapy -
'Yeah.{PRN long} .. Okay, so those three stay. Um, football equipment.
They can fundraise. {VOC laugh} So that can get the axe.{QUAL laughing}
Um, acting coaches.
Um -
That 'kinda, um {PRN kindum} seems like it would fall into the same category as football equipment.
Yeah. Okay, so poetry books?
Uh -
Maybe.
Books are important.
Uh, special ed teachers.
That's a definitely.
So we have sex ed, custodians, speech therapy -
And special ed teachers.
Cooking classes?
'Uh{PRN long} .. (I'd) axe it.. maybe.
{VOC laugh} Okay.{QUAl laughing}
Um, sugar free - Oh n- note takers.
Yeah. Yeah, it seems like a good (??) .. Okay, so we have five there. Um, sugar free juice machines.
Yeah, I don't either. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh}
Bookkeeping classes.
Maybe.
(If not) five.
Yeah, I didn't either.
So, axe it?
Then we have music teachers.
Yeah, I think so too. So, there's our six, and then we have -
A few at the top that -
We're on the fence on. Would you rather have assistant cooks, or math tutors?
Okay. Good call.
Okay so those are our seven.
Um, public health and safety.
Kay, reproductive education
I don't think so.
Think more of an education and programs.
So, probably not for that one. Um -
Job training programs.
Uh -
Possibly.
Like on the fence, maybe with that one? .. Okay.
Chicken pox vaccinations.
That seems kind of important.
I don't know.. Maybe.
Good point. Good point. {VOC laugh}
Okay, so probably not with that one.
Invasive - Okay, invasive species removal, that's - That seems like it might be a good program to have.
(You) think so too?
{VOC laugh} Okay. {VOC breath}
Actually -
I guess it depends on what it is, like how harmful it is.
I'm going extreme in my head.
Like it's gonna -
Mess with the population, but if it was something more like -
Like a certain species of bees -
Or something that's not really going to effect lives, then -
So.. possibly?
Uh, S_T_D_ education.
Um -
Yeah.
It's a maybe again.
Um.
Are we doing that too? Or just -?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, right?
Okay, toxic waste disposal. Uh, yeah. That - That seems -
Like a - Okay, so definitely that one. Hospital additions?
'I don't{PRN I'on't} .. think so.
(??) Bagel factory inspections.. I don't know about that one. {VOC laugh}
Right? {QUAl laughing} It's probably (only that one.) Uh, needle exchange.
It's seems like a good service, but it also seems kinda like, um -
It's very dependent on, like -
The -
It's almost like a l- I don't want to call it a luxury, but - It's kinda like a luxury service to have.. Like if you've got all your bases covered, and you have extra money then you'd have a needle exchange.
Veteran's medical assistance.
I think so too, take care of - {NVC} Take care of (??) Okay, so there's four. Egg farm regulations.
'Uh{PRN long} -
Yeah, I don't know about that one.
Weed 'control{PRN long final vowel}.
'Ah.{PRN long} {QUAL whispering}
I guess u- I don't know how harmful, like, having weeds grow up on the side of the road could be, you know? So - Probably not?
Prenatal check-ups
Ma- May- I'm- Maybe we should think that way cuz it seems like a luxury type of thing. But, like, yeah I guess -
Yeah, okay. And then neighborhood watch support.
Uh -
I don't know.
Uh{QUAL whispering}, it seems like it -
E- It seems like, uh - a little extra too.. Like, some of the like hospital additions and toxic 'waste dispose {PRN wait discos} - waste disposal seem pretty straight forward, but -
Okay, so we'll keep -
What did we say? Um, toxic waste, hospital -
Sex offender database, veteran's medical assistance.. and then we have three more to keep.
Yeah, job training seems good, so that's five. {VOC breath}
Um -
(??) Comes down to -
Which of these is better than the others.
Public health and safety. Well -
(I'd) say maybe -
Chicken pox seem- Now that I think of it, seems a little bit like, uh, don't need that one.
So much, um - Maybe reproductive education.
Then again, that could fall under the other category.
Maybe we should just pick two.
I would say, like, between prenatal and reproductive, one of the two.
If either.
Maybe prenatal check-ups.
and then -
How bout, what do you think for the other one?
S_T_D education?
Okay.. Okay, so there's our seven.
Okay, recreation and public services. Stray cat spaying.
I don't know. It doesn't seem like it would be that big of a problem.
Could be.. (like) -
I've never seen cats get too outta control.
You know what I mean? So - {QUAl laughing}{VOC breath} Uh, maybe.
Um, public news.
Yeah.. I like that id- .. Seem good?  .. Okay.
So we have public news, foodbank -
I like the idea of a food bank. Um, that's two. A junior soccer league.
Um -
Possibly.
It's nice to have like.. services for kids in a community, but -
Could be a luxury.
Kitten an- Kitten and puppy adoption.
I tend to like -
I tend to, like, favor humans over animals, you know - know so, if it came d- down to it, I'd probably choose the soccer league over that one. {QUAL laughing}{VOC laugh}
(??)  maybe neither of those. {QUAL lauging} {VOC laugh}
What do you think?
Okay. {QUAL lauging} {VOC laugh}
Um, okay. So we have soup kitchens.
(Say) yeah, so there's three. Um, definitely housing assistance? Okay, yeah. That's a good one. Dog catcher?
I don't know.
Uh.{QUAL whispering}
Yeah, it seems kinda unnecessary.
Skip it and come back? Okay.{QUAL laughing} Boys basketball club.
Um, maybe?
Kinda falls into the soccer league category.
Uh, public access station.
I'm not sure either. The only thing I can think of is like -
Uh, like a lodge where you could go get your information.
Type thing.
Yeah, let's pass on that. {QUAL laughing}
Reusable bag campaign.
Uh hhh.
Maybe?{QUAl muttering}
Okay. Veterinary hospital?
That seems.
You'd think so. Yeah.
So, maybe cut that one from our public service type thing?
{VOC breath} Okay, football stadium upkeep.
(1x) I would say -
Right. {VOC laugh}
And pest control.
Yeah, right. Doesn't that seem like it would be a private type of thing?
Okay, so (pass on that one).
Okay, so we have -
Public news, foodbank -
Um -
Soup kitchen.. Housing. Yeah.
And then -
Looks like we could do the -
Kitten and puppy adoption?
And then may the.. things for the kids? The junior soccer league, and basketball club?
Sound good?
Okay.
Okay.
Infrastructure and licensing.
Uh, teaching certificates.
Interesting.
Seems like it could be a private thing too.
So, maybe not there. Um, speed limit signs. Yeah definitely. {QUAL laughing} {VOC laugh} {VOC breath} Additional bus stops.
Guess it depends on how much of a concern, like the traffic, and - It's pretty bad here, so that might be helpful.
So yeah.
Okay, uh, those two. Tattoo artist licenses.
No.
{VOC laugh} Yeah, I don't know.. Wha- It's a tough one.
(1x) Doesn't it seem like it could be a private thing too?
So maybe we'll come back to these ones {VOC laugh} if we don't get seven. Um -
Boating licenses.
Yeah, it does.
I guess pass on that one. Uh, pothole maintenance.
Uh, definitely. That's - That's important one. Okay, so those three. Subway system.
Uh - {QUAL whispering}
(??) pretty nice to have a subway.
Let's throw that one on there. {VOC laugh} Okay, hunting tags.
Kinda goes into the same as the ones above, so not, um - Towing services.
Hhh doesn't seem like a - like it needs to be a government thing.
Okay, how bout massage certificates? {VOC laugh} Flagpole repair? {VOC cough}
I th- That one seems - {QUAl whispering}
Well.. I don't know.
Seems kind of an odd one, doesn't it? Like - .. maybe  that could be a private -
Like.. company for somebody.
Uh - W- I wouldn't want my public government to be paying for that.
I don't think.
Okay, taxi stops.
Yeah.
What's that?
So maybe not on that one.
Uh, fishing 'licensing{PRN licing}. Same as before. Okay, public bus upkeep.
Yeah, I'd say that too. So that'd be five, and then drainage ditches.
I'd think so especially since it rains so much here. S- That would make sense. Okay, so there's six.
Which of these is not like the other for you?
Um, okay let's see.
I'm thinking like -
Flagpole repair, towing services -
And teaching certificates.
(Kay), teaching certificates you think?
Okay, yeah.
Education's important.
Okay.. I think that's our seven.
'Is that{PRN zat} everything?
Good job.
That's kinda fun.
Sure.
Okay. Makes sense.
Okay.
Hm.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mmhm.
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah. Alright. {QUAL laughing}
Yeah, they can fundraise.
Yeah.
Mmhm.
Yeah.
Yeah. {NVC} Think so.
Yeah.
Mmhm.
{VOC mouthnoise} I don't think that's important. {VOC laugh}
I never took any bookkeeping classes.  Did you?
Yeah.
Music's important.
Math tutors.{QUAl whispering}
Yeah.
Uh, does it really belong under there?
Okay.
Yeah.
Mmhm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um -
Um.. It does seem important.. but is the government paying for it?
I don't know.{QUAL laughing}
Yeah.
No. {VOC laugh}
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Mmhm.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know how to decide where it should belong though.
No, and we're not, but it seems like it doesn't -
Belong in that -
Category. I don't know.
Yeah.
Mmhm.
Yeah.
How many bagel factories are there?
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.. Right.
Yes.
Um.. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.

Um.. Is this for, like, low income people, or - {VOC laugh}
Okay.
Okay, then I say yes.
Mm-hm.

Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
{VOC breath} {VOC mouthnoise} Um, job training?

Um, I don't know what that means.
Okay.{PRN oh kay}
Oh.
Um -
Isn't it, um -?
Self sustaining though?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They can fundraise. {VOC laugh}
Pest control. {QUAL muttering}
I don't - Is that a city.. expense?
Where - (Are the) p-? Yeah.

Soup kitchen
Housing

Because they're both baking ingredients.
Uh-huh.
Liters of water.
Hm. {QUAL long}
Oh now, see, w- we've got eggs and ice cream out here, too.
Hm.
(Well) my next one -
Mm-kay.
Sticks of butter. So why don't we put it over in the refrigerated section?

Beets. So this is produce, so should we put it maybe on this side of - ?
Go ahead.

Alright!
Cushions for deck 'chair {PRN share}, it should - maybe - maybe under the - ?
Okay.

I'm sorry. She told us not to move it, but -
That's somewhere over there, too.
Flags. {QUAL long}
Where'd we put that siding?
Should we put it over here with the outdoor -
outdoorsy things?
Well, somewhere over there.
Hats. Where's our clothing?
Right over here.
We'll allow - {QUAL creaky}
another.
Yeah. {QUAL whispering}
Or.. we coulda put it by the water. {QUAL whispering on 'water'}
But we're not supposed to move those! {QUAL whispering}
Face cream. Toiletries. Where we got - okay.
So that in the -
Yeah.
Looks good.
Bags of peat moss, I'm gonna put that over here.
Sure.
Gas-powered cookstoves over here? Or should we do it -
along with the outdoorsy things? Maybe -
But that's a crap shoot.
Maybe we should put it over here somewhere.
Electric heaters. Should I put it - ?
Gee!
Um.
Hm.
They have it -
in the grocery s- well -
wine in the grocery store.
Trying to think, by -
by the refrigerated stuff, so maybe somewhere over on that column.
Fishing net we're gonna put up here.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Buckets, {VOC breath} I'm gonna put back over here.
Okay, so that's for school supplies.
So let's put it right in here in the middle somewhere.
Shoe- oh, go ahead. Good!
Shoelaces, I'm gonna put with {QUAL long 'th'} that kinda stuff.

Bundles of sticks. So, I'm just gonna put it somewhere in here.
Cuz w- oh, we have the pre-cut wood here, too, so.. that's good.
Sure. Mm-hm.. mm-hm.
Small saws.
Scissors, I'm gonna put next to the tape.
We could put that in - in - maybe by the paper bags or something?
Boxes of doughnuts.
Do we have bakery? .. We have baking goods.
Okay. {NVC}
Thanks you.
Hm.
I guess we have to put it over here.
And the large 'vests. {PRN vesss}

And wetsuits -
Uh - {QUAL very creaky} Just.. right there, too.

Socks. {QUAL long s's}
Let's - let's do one at a time. Socks -

I think the best thing would be to put them -
Close to that.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, put it beside it.
Thick sweaters, yeah.
I hate to do that, but - {VOC breath} {NVC}
Okay.
And I've got -
Dried figs, so I will put with the cake mix. Oh -

This is good as we can do.
