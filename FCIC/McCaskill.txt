sp	
Thank you, Mister Chairman, and thank you, Mister Blankfein for being here today. I wanna 	1
{VOC breath}	
start by um, 	1
{VOC mouthnoise}	
saying that in many ways, the focus on just your firm 	1
{VOC breath}	
is tremendously unfair. 	1
	
Um, this - this - the activities that are being talked about, and I'm sure 	0
{VOC breath}	
there - we could compile 	1
{VOC breath}	
the same kind of documents, the same kind of emails 	1
{VOC breath}	
from all of your competitors 	1
{VOC breath}	
on Wall Street. I mean, the conduct that we're 	1
{VOC breath}	
looking at 	1
	
um 	0
{VOC mouthnoise}	
is - is - was not exclusive 	1
{VOC breath}	
to Goldman Sachs and I think it's important to acknowledge that on the record. 	1
{VOC breath}	
In fairness, there probably ought to be another four or five C_E_O_s sitting up there with you, 	2
{VOC breath}	
as we discuss-	1
	
I'm sure you would. 	2
	
I'm sure you would. 	2
{VOC breath}	
Um. 	0
	
{VOC start}	
And - and I know it seems like we're harping, but it's because that - so many of the 	2
{VOC breath}	
cultural realities of what you all do 	2
	
is jarring 	2
	
to m- to most Americans. 	2
	
Um, this notion of um, 	1
	
selling a product that you're betting against 	1
	
is hard for people to understand, that just have basic sense of right and wrong and common sense. 	2
{VOC breath}	
And we've spent a lot of time going over that today. I want to talk about uh several details as it relates to that. 	2
	
Um. 	0
	
One is that it's clear to me that you all had - There was kind of an orphan document in the documents that we got, and one of the orphan documents we got 	2
{VOC breath}	
was from a woman named Manisha Nanik 	0
	
to a - a person named Loren Morris. And what it was is a summary of an analysis 	1
	
of mortgages 	1
	
that you all were gonna 	1
	
slice and dice 	2
	
and - and do all the tranches, and -	1
{VOC breath}	
And um, 	0
{VOC breath}	
and it's a fairly detailed - This is uh exhibit number seventy seven - It's a fairly detailed finding, and uh it's important, the date on this 	2
{VOC breath}	
is March thirteenth, two thousand and seven. 	2
	
Uh, on this document. 	0
	
Th- this document says that .. seven percent .. of the mortgages that they l- that - that - that the Goldman employee looked at 	0
{VOC breath}	
had material occupancy misrepresentations, where borrowers took anywhere 	1
{VOC breath}	
from four to fourteen loans at a time and defaulted on all. 	2
	
Uh, your risk in the loan performance and difficulty foreclosing on the second liens would be potentially unsecured. 	2
{VOC breath}	
Another twenty percent of the pool had material compliance issues. 	2
{VOC breath}	
They're mainly missing final HUDs. 	2
{VOC breath}	
Uh, we cannot put these loans .. back. We will need to consider option of our service or fixing the areas - the errors via refinance, refund, or disclosure. 	1
	
It's exhibit number seventy seven. 	0
	
{VOC start} {VOC start} {VOC start} {VOC start} {VOC start} {VOC start} 	
	
She goes on to say, approximately ten percent of the pool is flagged as potential R_E_O_ or potential unsecured of second lien. 	1
{VOC breath} 	
Another five percent of the pool 	2
	
was originally fraudulently based on the D_D_ results. 	2
{VOC breath}	
Main findings, possible I_D_ theft, .. broker misrepresentation, straw buyer, 	2
{VOC breath}	
falsification of information origination documents. 	2
{VOC breath}	
{VOC start}	
There is - And then - and then she says, there's a reputation headline risk, as well. 	1
{VOC breath}	
So - .. w- Now, I'm not sure if these - uh - You did issue a bunch of New Century mortgages, um, 	1
{VOC breath}	
at or around that time in a - in a C_D_O_, 	0
	
um in a - 	0
{VOC start}	
i- i- in one of these 	0
	
instruments. 	0
{VOC breath}	
I - I can't say that these are the ones that you issued, but what it tells me is 	2
{VOC breath}	
you had internal analysis on these mortgages. 	2
	
Well, 	2
{VOC start}	
what it - .. I think what - 	1
{VOC start}	
It's plain on its face that this is a - a Goldman Sachs employee that has uh analyzed 	2
	
a group of mortgages that you all were considering .. packaging up -	2
	
Either for somebody to bet on or bet against.  	2
	
Well, I'd - I - 	2
{VOC start}	
Here's what I'm - 	2
	
This is your document. This came from you. It's a Goldman Sachs document. 	3
	
I don't know whether you did these or not. The point I'm trying to make is it shows that an analysis was going on on the mortgages that go- went into your instruments. 	3
{VOC breath}	
Internally. 	3
	
Okay. 	0
{VOC breath}	
Well, if - if that's the case, then when you - when you issued the - 	2
	
all the - 	2
	
uh, .. all the documents that you did when you did the um - 	2
{VOC mouthnoise}	
What's the name of the company 	0
{NVC}	
that had all the problems? 	0
	
Long Beach Mortgage. 	0
{VOC breath}	
Uh, when you did all the Long Beach Mortgage, do you think you did the same analysis on all the Long Beach mortgages? 	1
	
Well, in May two thousand and six, you were the co-lead underwriter with WaMu to securitize about five hundred and thirty two in subprime second lien 	2
{VOC breath}	
fixed rate mortgages originated by Long Beach. 	2
{VOC breath}	
Now, keep in mind that this is the same Long Beach that had - had to buy back 	2
	
hundreds of millions of dollars of mortgages because of problems. 	2
{VOC breath}	
Um, at one point in time a few years earlier, they'd been shut down 	0
	
because of problems. 	2
{VOC breath}	
And I guess um, 	1
{VOC start} {VOC start} {VOC start} 	
I would like to request, on behalf of the committee, that we see the analysis, 	2
	
uh first of all, that we figure out what - .. what mortgages these were that were analyzed, where you found fraud and you found 	2
{VOC breath}	
uh five percent fraud, .. seven percent material occupancy misrepresentation, twenty percent material compliance issues. 	0
{VOC breath}	
Um, I think it would be important for us to see those documents 	2
{VOC breath}	
on - n- on the instruments you created .. um, for folks to take a side on. 	2
	
Yeah. 	x
	
I mean, I think the point is 	2
{VOC breath}	
that it's hard for us to believe 	2
{VOC breath}	
um that if you all were doing the due dil- diligence that you've stated a couple of times in your - 	2
{VOC breath} 	
in your testimony, 	2
{VOC breath}	
now we know 	2
	
that these things were full .. of this kind of stuff. 	2
	
We know that. 	2
	
And you obviously knew it on - on - on - w- one instance because we have a document from .. somebody in your employ that 	2
	
um thirty eight percent of the loans are out of tolerance. 	0
{VOC breath}	
I'm recommending putting back twenty six percent of the pool, if possible. 	0
	
Uh - uh - uh - I - I - It doesn't make me comfortable 	2
	
that you all, after doing the due diligence, 	2
{VOC breath}	
actually 	2
{VOC breath}	
um disclosed as much as you maybe should have disclosed about some of the problematic .. paper that you were packaging up for investors, 	2
	
and so I would like to follow that trail 	2
{VOC breath}	
and get the same kind of documents on the instruments that you did - 	2
{VOC breath}	
that you did put out in the market, both in two thousand six, two thousand seven - 	2
	
{VOC breath}	
Kay. .. Um. 	0
	
Let me ask you this. Uh, and by the way, another - .. In May of two thousand six, right about when you did that, 	1
	
uh Office of Thrift Supervision just did a scoop 	0
	
at Long Beach 	0
	
uh .. and found all kinds of problems with their mortgages, almost at the exact time you were putting your instrument out. 	1
{VOC breath}	
So that's why I question 	0
{NVC}	
what kind of due diligence was actually going on and h- how much due diligence you were actually 	1
{VOC breath}	
using in - in - in 	0
{VOC start}	
telling the buying public what was in these various .. transactions. 	1
{VOC breath}	
In your testimony, you expressed um - 	2
	
you ex- you expressed regret that Goldman missed the signs of a system where credit was too easy. .. Um. 	1
{VOC breath}	
and you've said nobody could know when the housing market would crash or how bad it would crash. 	0
{VOC breath}	
Do you - Looking back, do you think that 	0
	
uh, {VOC start} 	0
you'd .. all did enough to look at what was in these - what were in these instruments and - and - w- and how strong they were on - on their face? 	0
{VOC breath}	
Uh - {VOC start}	0
Do you think .. you exposed 	1
{VOC breath}	
the kind of problems that these loans - the vast majority of these loans represented? 	1
	
More disclosure - Would more disclosure, in fact, harm your business model? 	1
	
If you truly are just the house, 	2
{VOC breath}	
if you truly are just trying to 	2
{VOC breath}	
manage 	2
{VOC breath} {VOC start} {VOC start} {VOC start} {VOC start} 	
um, {VOC start} 	0
transactions on both sides of a proposition? 	1
	
Yeah, and - and - and it's - it's interesting to me that - .. that .. the investment banks that, um, 	2
{VOC mouthnoise}	
have created all these exotic .. instruments, 	0
{VOC breath}	
that there has not been more effort to push for more disclosure, 	2
	
um that it appears that we are dragging you along kicking and screaming. 	2
{VOC breath}	
Is that an unfair characterization? 	0
	
There is no question that in - uh sometime in early two thousand and seven, 	2
	
uh, you realized that there was a lot of - you had a lot of residual positions, 	2
	
uh equity residual positions on these 	2
	
uh C_D_O_s, and that you wanted those books cleaned up as quickly as possible. 	2
	
Well, in exhibit number one thirty, there's an email from you 	2
	
to Tom Montag, 	2
	
and the email reads as follows. Tom, you refer to losses stemming from residual positions in old deals. 	0
{VOC breath}	
Could should we have cleaned up these books before, 	0
{VOC breath}	
and are we doing enough right now to sell off cats and dogs .. in other books throughout the division? 	0
	
That was in February of two thousand and seven.	0
	
	
That would seem to be indicating that at - at - in early two thousand seven, before you all had, 	2
	
in fact, 	0
{VOC breath}	
marketed more of these 	2
	
synthetic C_D_O_s, 	0
{VOC breath}	
that you um were basically saying, let's clean up .. the residual positions we have, the cats and dogs, 	2
{VOC breath}	
and push them to traders.	2
	
Okay.	0
	
Well, I will just tell you, I won't take the time to read through the whole email chain, but it's clear if you read through the whole email chain, 	2
{VOC breath}	
this whole email chain 	2
{VOC breath}	
was about risk in the whole loan trading business. 	2
{VOC breath}	
And it's clear that what was going on here is there was a lot of internal noise 	2
{VOC breath}	
about the fact that you had .. long positions, 	2
{VOC breath}	
uh equity positions in a lot of this stuff as you guys were moving into - 	0
{VOC breath}	
um what - .. I think we've 	1
{VOC start} {VOC start} 	
beaten this horse until it's almost dead. Into um some major short positions 	1
{VOC breath}	
throughout two thousand and seven. 	0
{VOC breath}	
And I - I - 	2
{VOC start} I'm m- 	
as - as the Chairman said earlier, in earlier questioning of other witnesses, 	1
{VOC breath}	
um as you all keep talking about your net .. for two thousand and seven, 	2
{VOC breath}	
no one has been able to delineate specifically how much of the long position that you were suffering in two thousand seven, 	2
{VOC breath}	
is this really old stuff? 	2
{VOC breath}	
As opposed to any 	2
{VOC breath}	
notion that you guys were actually participating 	2
{VOC breath}	
in long purchases through two thousand and seven.	2
	
Right. 	0
	
Okay. 	0
	
Well, I'm - .. um -	0
{VOC start}	
I'm not sure when you look at all the documents that the - the - the older long positions you had would be considered small by most people's standards, 	2
{VOC breath}	
but maybe it would within the context of your organization. 	1
	
Yeah, I- I- I-  	2
{VOC start}	
And -	0
{VOC breath}	
And - and I guess what I'm trying to get at is the point we've been trying to make, and this is - .. this is where I think, 	2
{VOC breath}	
um, 	0
	
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC start} {VOC start}	
this notion that you guys are market makers, 	0
	
and you also are taking 	0
	
um - .. sometimes taking positions 	0
	
um, {QUAL creaky}	0
outside of your just market making. 	0
	
uh that that is what's hard for .. many of us to kinda get our arms around. 	2
{VOC breath}	
And I guess, you know - I've - I've 	2
{VOC start}	
I've been talking sports analogies today because 	2
{VOC breath}	
I think there's a lot about this .. that relates to 	2
{VOC breath}	
gambling on a sporting event, .. because the synthetic C_D_O_s didn't resep- represent anything but gambling. 	2
{VOC breath}	
Um, it was folks taking one side or the other on - 	2
{VOC breath}	
It wasn't real mortgages in there. It was just stuff saying, take a bet! 	2
	
Just like you bet on a football game. 	2
	
Is there anything that you would not create a market for if a client came to you to create a market? I - I understand that some people are trying to create 	2
{VOC breath}	
a derivative market now in how movies are going to do. 	2
	
But didn't Mister Paulson just wanna make money because he thought the market was gonna tank? 	3
{VOC breath}	
Wasn't - He didn't have a - 	2
{VOC breath}	
He just was looking for a place to - to - to score on a bet! Wasn't he? 	3
	
I understand. 	1+
	
I understand. 	1+
	
M- M- 	x
Mister Blankfein, there is a big difference between finding the opposite side of a certainty in a commodity hedge for a farmer that needs certainty 	2
{VOC breath}	
or an airline company that needs to 	2
{VOC breath}	
figure out what jet fuel's gonna cost 	2
{VOC breath}	
and two sides of a deal that are both just betting. 	2
	
There is - there is nothing in a synthetic C_D_O_ 	2
{VOC breath}	
that is essential to certainty to anybody's business other than somebody just deciding they want to take one side of a deal and the other side of a deal. 	2
{VOC breath}	
That's what a synthetic C_D_O_ is! 	2
	
And we can't take this too far? 	2
{VOC breath}	
We can't t- conti- I mean d-, you don't think that there's a point where 	2
	
we make up stuff to bet on and you guys are securitizing it 	2
{VOC breath}	
and tranching it - ?	2
{VOC breath}	
And - and - and especially the situation in - in this instance. 	2
{VOC breath}	
Um, you know - 	2
{VOC start} {VOC start} 	
you - you -	2
put one side of the bet in the room with the people who are picking the product, 	2
	
a- which is, 	2
	
uh I think, bizarre. I guess you- 	2
{VOC start} {VOC start} y- 	x
your representatives this morning acted like it wasn't any big deal- 	2
	
They - .. That .. the person who came to you that wanted to bet against the deal, .. you put them in the room with the - with the - the .. s- people who were going to pick the stuff in the deal. 	2
	
In other words, 	2
{VOC breath}	
it wasn't - you didn't put both sides in there. You put one side of the bet in with the people who were picking the product that was going to be gambled on! 	3
	
That seems weird. .. It's - a- it - You know what it reminds me of? 	3
{VOC breath}	
It reminds me of this notion 	2
{VOC breath} {VOC start}	
I think most Americans think it would be really wrong .. for one of the football players .. to be able to be in the room with the bookie trying to influence 	2
{VOC breath}	
what the line was going to be, and then they turn around and bet on the game they're playing in! 	3
	
That's what this feels like. It feels like that 	3
{VOC breath}	
you guys are betting on the game you're playing in 	2
	
and that maybe it's not a level playing field. 	2
	
I - I - I understand that. I - I um - 	1+
{VOC breath}	
It - .. it -	2
	
You - But - 	2
but you understand that it f-	2
	
It feels like you guys 	2
{VOC breath}	
were pushing a product that you were betting against 	2
	
at the same time 	2
{VOC breath}	
you were letting somebody who wanted one side of the deal in the room with the people who were picking the product! 	3
{VOC breath}	
Not the other side of the deal. 	2
{VOC breath}	
None of that seems like even Steven. None of that seems like y- you're an honest bookie 	2
{VOC breath}	
who's trying to manage risk on both sides and just get it down to the vig. 	2
	
Well, that also seems weird. 	2
	
That also seems weird. 	2
{VOC breath}	
I mean, it seems like to me that if you um - 	2
{VOC breath}	
you know, and - and I - it's hard for me to believe that that selection agent 	2
{VOC breath}	
was excited about that deal if they really knew 	2
{VOC breath}	
the person who was helping them pick all the deals was making- w- wanted to bet against it.	2
	
And I'm not sure that, frankly, um, 	2
{VOC breath}	
it - it - it is 	2
	
a thing of value that 	1
	
most Americans would be comfortable that we would be backing up 	1
{VOC breath}	
and providing taxpayer bailouts to companies that were engaging in that, 	1
{VOC breath}	
uh especially if you weren't actually really dealing .. with a commodity 	1
{VOC breath}	
or dealing with a product at the base of the transaction, that you were 	1
{VOC breath}	
making up securitizations for people to, in fact, 	1
{VOC breath}	
take positions on, only for that reason. 	1
{VOC breath}	
Um, it seemed like - it seems like hamsters in a cage 	1
{VOC breath}	
trying to get to compensation 	1
{VOC breath}	
as opposed to societal value that investment banks in this country, I think, 	1
{VOC breath}	
have represented for many many years. 	1
{VOC breath}	
I really appreciate you being here today. 	1
{VOC breath}	
I hope you stay at the table with us as we work on this legislation. 	1
{VOC breath}	
I think, clearly, this hearing has shown in the work this committee has done, and the staff has done amazing work here, 	2
{VOC breath}	
that we have conflict of interest issues, 	2
{VOC breath}	
we have disclosure issues, 	2
{VOC breath}	
and we have transparency issues, 	2
{VOC breath}	
and we need to get all of those fixed to make sure 	2
{VOC breath}	
we don't have a repeat 	2
{VOC breath}	
of this debacle. .. Thank you, Mister Chairman. 	2
