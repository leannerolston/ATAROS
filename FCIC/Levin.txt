We now will call our final witness for today's hearing, uh Lloyd Blankfein, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs. Mister 	0
{VOC breath}	
Blankfein, we appreciate your being with us today. 	0
sp	
Pursuant to Rule six, all witnesses who testify before the Subcommittee are required to be sworn, so we would ask you to stand and raise your right hand.	0
sp	
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?	0
sp	
Thank you very much. You uh - 	0
sp	
I don't know if you've heard the - 	0
sp	
earlier uh .. testimony or not, but we use a wi- a timing system which will - 	0
sp	
give you a red light in five minutes. And the light will turn .. yellow after four minutes - 	0
sp	
uh so that you can try to uh - 	0
sp	
give us your testimony, if possible, in five minutes.	0
sp	
Thank you very much, uh, Mister Blankfein. Um - 	0
sp	
we've heard -	0
sp	
in earlier panels today 	0
sp	
example after example 	0
sp	
where 	0
sp	
Goldman 	0
sp	
was 	0
sp	
selling securities to people 	0
sp	
and then 	0
sp	
not telling them that they were taking and intended to maintain a short position against those same securities. 	0
sp	
I'm deeply troubled by that, 	1-
sp	
and it's made worse .. when .. your own employees 	1-
sp	
believe that those securities 	1-
sp	
are junk 	1-
sp	
or a piece of crap 	2-
sp	
or a shitty deal, .. words that 	2-
sp	
those emails .. show your employees believe 	2
{VOC breath} 	
about a number .. of those deals. 	2
sp	
Billion-dollar Tim- Timberwolf, .. synthetic C_D_O_ squared. .. C_D_O_s get squared now. 	2-
sp	
A senior executive called it a shitty transaction, but the Goldman sales force .. was told that it was a priority item for two straight months.	2-
sp	
Goldman sold six hundred million dollars in Timberwolf securities to clients while at the same time 	0
{VOC breath}	
holding a short position, 	1-
sp	
in other words, betting against it.	2-
sp	
The C_D_O_ goes to junk sta- it went to .. junk status in about seven months. Your investors lost big time.	1-
sp	
But 	2-
sp	
Goldman 	2-
sp	
won on that deal, profited on that deal. 	2-
	
In the five hundred million dollar .. Long Beach R_M_B_S_ deal, 	0
sp	
Goldman shorted it at the same time that it was selling it to clients.	0
sp	
Securities .. defaulted within a few years with a sixty five percent delinquency rate.	0
{VOC breath}	
The bad news 	1
sp	
in your own words, was that .. your clients lose money.	1
sp	
But .. the good news is that .. Goldman Sachs made money .. on that deal.	1
sp	
The next one, the seven hundred million dollar Fremont deal. .. This was a R_M_B_S_ of subprime loans, 	0
sp	
a notoriously bad lender. 	2-
sp	
Your folks new it. 	2-
sp	
One of your clients talks to your sales force about it, and your sales force 	0
sp	
among themselves 	1
sp	
call it crap loans. 	1-
sp	
They go out and sell em anyway. 	2-
sp	
The same time .. that you're selling - your people - your sales people are selling those	0
sp	
items, they 	0
sp	
are 	0
sp	
shorting the deal. 	1
sp	
So you short them so that Goldman makes money when this security fails, which it did in ten months.	2-
sp	
On the three hundred million dollar Anderson synthetic C_D_O_, 	1
sp	
C_D_O_ is stuffed with .. New Century loans. These are known 	1
sp	
to be shoddy loans. .. I think it was one or two on the list of 	1
sp	
bad loan producers. 	1
sp	
A client of yours asked, 	0
sp	
how did Goldman Sachs get comfortable with this deal? 	2-
sp	
Goldman Sachs, in other words, pointing out that it was New Century. 	0
sp	
Goldman Sachs 	0
sp	
didn't respond .. and did not say, we're not comfortable, we're shorting it. We're betting against this deal. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
Asked a direct question, how can you guys get comfortable with a deal involving 	2-
{VOC breath}	
those loans? And instead of responding honestly, 	2-
	
we got problems, too, .. we're not taking any chances on this deal, we may be selling it, .. but we're also betting against it. That's not what happened. Instead -	1-
sp	
the client was told .. that Goldman was an equity holder, which it was, .. at the same time, but that was a half truth .. because it was also betting against .. that same security. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
That C_D_O_ failed within seven months. 	1-
sp	
Your clients lost. 	2-
sp	
Goldman profits. 	2-
sp	
The two billion dollar Hudson synthetic C_D_O_. Goldman Sachs 	0
{VOC breath} 	
was the sole protection buyer on this C_D_O_ with a two billion dollar .. short. .. In other words, they were betting against it. 	2-
sp	
A Goldman sales person described it as junk, 	1-
sp	
not to the .. buyer, of course, 	2-
{VOC breath}	
but inside. 	0
sp	
The C_D_O_ .. imploded within two years. Your clients lost.	1-
sp	
Goldman profited. 	1-
sp	
Now -	0
sp	
there is such a fundamental conflict, it seems to me, 	1
	
when Goldman is selling securities 	1-
sp	
which - .. particularly when its own people .. believe they are .. bad .. items, .. described in the way .. these emails show that they were described and 	1-
sp	
how they were - .. but they - .. your own sales people believed about them. 	1-
{VOC breath}	
To go out .. and sell these securities to people 	2-
{VOC breath}	
and then bet against those same securities, 	2-
{VOC breath}	
it seems to me, is a fundamental conflict of interest 	2-
{VOC breath}	
and is - raises a real ethical issue. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
And I'd like to 	0
{VOC breath}	
ask you whether or not you believe that Goldman 	2
sp	
um, 	0
sp	
in fact, .. treated those .. clients properly. .. And .. as you say, if clients believe we don't deserve their trust, you're not gonna survive. 	1
{VOC breath}	
Those are the ringing words you give us in your opening .. statement. 	0
{VOC breath}	
How - h- given that kind of a history	2-
sp	
here 	0
sp	
going heavily short in a market, 	0
sp	
which you did. You made a strategic decision .. to do that. 	1-
sp	
But then on these specific examples 	1-
sp	
to be betting against the very securities which you're selling to your clients 	2-
sp	
and .. internally .. your own people believe 	0
sp	
that these .. are .. crappy .. securities. 	2-
sp	
How do you expect 	1-
sp	
to 	0
sp	
deserve the trust of your clients, and .. is there not an inherent conflict here?	1-
sp	
Do you think they know that you think something is a piece of crap when you sell it to them and then bet against it? You think they know that?	3-
sp	
I - I - We went through it today. 	2-
sp	
I'm just asking you a question. Do you think if your people 	2-
sp	
think something is a piece of crap, 	2-
sp	
and go out and sell that, and then your company bets against it, .. do you think that that deserves your trust?	2-
sp	
No, no. *You bet against it.	2-
sp	
When you sell something to a client, they think, .. presumably, you're rid of it. .. It's no longer in your inventory.	2-
sp	
Not necessarily, but they have at least a right to believe that you want that 	2-
sp	
security .. to work for them. That is a belief which I would think most customers would have. But here's what you- i- in these - Example after example -	2-
sp	
it's not just that you sold something, which obviously meant .. someone was buying it. There's a seller and a buyer. That's not what we're talking about. 	1-
sp	
We're talking about .. betting against .. the very thing that you're selling. 	2-
sp	
Betting against it, going short against it 	2-
{VOC breath}	
without disclosing .. that to that client. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
You think people would buy securities .. from you if you 	2-
sp	
if you said, you know, 	1-
sp	
we want you to know this. .. We're gonna sell you this, but we're gonna take a- .. going out and buying 	1-
sp	
insurance against this security succeeding. 	1-
{VOC breath}	
We're taking a short position. 	1-
{VOC breath}	
We're getting this thing out of our inventory. 	1-
sp	
We're betting against this very thing we're selling to you. That's a totally different thing 	2-
{VOC breath}	
from selling a security 	1-
{VOC breath}	
and no longer having an interest in it. 	1-
{VOC breath}	
My question is, 	2-
sp	
is there not a conflict .. when you sell something .. to somebody .. and then 	1-
	
are determined 	1-
{VOC breath}	
to bet against that same .. security .. and you don't disclose that .. to the person .. you're selling it? Do you see a problem?	2-
sp	
Yeah, and that's the part that's very confusing to folks cuz they think you - 	2-
They think you're fiduciaries, 	2-
{VOC breath}	
and then -	0
sp	
Yeah, but .. they are not told that not only are you not a fiduciary, you are betting against the very security that you're selling to them! 	3-
{VOC breath}	
You don't disclose that. .. That's worse -	3-
sp	
That's worse than not being a fiduciary. 	2-
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath}	
That's being in a conflict of interest situation.	3-
sp	
That you are betting against the security you're selling to them? They don't care?	3-
sp	
Yeah. You're betting. You're going short against the very security. You're holding a short position 	2-
{VOC breath}	
against the very security. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
I read you over and over and over again, 	2
{VOC breath}	
you're selling securities, 	2
sp	
many of which are described as crap by your own sales force internally. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
Putting that aside just for a moment. We'll come back to that. .. That makes it worse. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
But there's an inherent conflict 	2-
	
when you don't disclose to your client 	2-
{VOC breath}	
that .. this security that you're buying from us 	2-
{VOC breath}	
has obviously a short side, .. but *we're the people .. who are keeping the short on this one. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
We're betting against 	2-
{VOC breath}	
this security 	2-
{VOC breath}	
succeeding. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
And you don't think that's relevant to a client? 	2-
sp	
(Maybe just) call it a human context.	2-
sp	
You don't believe it's relevant .. to a customer of yours, .. that you are selling a security to, that you are betting .. against that same security? You just don't think it's relevant 	2-
{VOC breath}	
and needs to be disclosed. Is that the bottom line?	2-
sp	
Oh, yes, they did. 	3-
sp	
Oh, yes, they did. 	3-
sp	
Oh. Now - now you're saying they might know.	2-
sp	
Yeah. .. And - and - .. what do you think - 	1
{VOC start}	
By the way they have an idea, more than an idea in these cases. But putting that aside, what do you think about 	1
{VOC breath}	
selling securities which your own people think are 	1
{NVC}	
crap? .. Does that bother you?	2-
sp	
No, this is real.	2-
sp	
We heard it today. 	2
sp	
We heard it today. This is a shitty deal. This is crap. 	2-
sp	
Four or five examples. What - what's your reaction to that? 	2
sp	
How about the sales person? 	1
sp	
I'm - I understand that. We're talking where *you were the seller of the security and *you, 	2
sp	
*you, Goldman Sachs, 	2
sp	
believes .. it's a piece of crap. 	2-
sp	
Where you -  Where you - no, as 	2-
part of the deal. I'm talking about this. I'm not talking about where you're 	2-
{VOC breath}	
selling securities out of your inventory. I understand that. 	1
{VOC breath}	
People come to you, you buy se- .. you s- 	2
	
buy securities. .. I'm talking about 	2
{VOC breath}	
where the *deal is 	2
sp	
that you're selling 	2
sp	
has you in the short position .. and intending to keep that position.	2
sp	
That's the deal. .. And whether there's not an obligation then .. to disclose to the people you're selling .. to in that deal - 	2-
{VOC breath}	
Hey, .. we, .. Goldman, .. we may be selling it to you, but we .. believe .. that this thing's going the other direction. We're taking the short position. 	2
{VOC breath}	
You don't see any conflict in that?	2-
sp	
And where you take a short position, you think that should be disclosed?	2
sp	
Where you're betting against that same security you're selling, you think that ou- yes or no, do you think that ought to be disclosed or not?	2-
sp	
Yeah. You're taking the short position and you're staying. You intend to keep it. That's a bet against that security .. succeeding.	2-
sp	
No let - just - 	3
Just try my question. 	2-
	
In a - 	x
	
No, in - Just try my question.	2-
sp	
In a deal where you are selling securities, .. and you are intending to keep the short side of that deal, 	2
{VOC breath}	
which is what happened here 	2
{VOC breath}	
in a lot of these deals, 	2
{VOC breath}	
do you think you have an obligation to tell the person 	2
{VOC breath}	
that you're selling that security to in that deal 	2
{VOC breath}	
that you are keeping the s- short position in that deal? 	2
{VOC breath}	
That's my question.	2
sp	
That's cor- Well no. 	x
That you intend .. to keep that short position.	2
{VOC breath}	
Not forever. It's your intention to keep that short position. 	2
sp	
I'm - {VOC start} {VOC start}	x
I said, where you intend to keep a short position. That's my question.	2
sp	
How about in - you're investing in these securities. This isn't a market making deal. This is where you have made a decision, .. strategically, 	2
{VOC breath}	
to you - Or not strategically, forget that. You've made a decision 	2
{VOC breath}	
to 	0
sp	
bet against, .. to take the short side of 	1
sp	
a security that you're selling. 	1
sp	
And you don't think .. that there is any moral obligation here?	2
sp	
Put aside the legal obligation. You don't think there's an obligation 	2
{VOC breath}	
to tell the person 	2
	
that you're selling this to 	2
{VOC breath}	
that you .. are betting against that security by maintaining 	2
{VOC breath}	
a short position in it? 	2
{VOC breath}	
It's a very straightforward question.	2-
sp	
That's not the opposite side from that client! .. That's the same side. 	3-
sp	
No. You said a client comes to you and wants to sell you something. You decide whether to buy or sell it. That - .. or not - whether to buy it or not.	2-
sp	
But I'm saying where you're *not selling it to anyone else, you are 	2-
{VOC breath}	
selling to somebody and you are taking the opposite position. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
You are betting. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
You are going out and getting a default swap, 	2-
{VOC breath}	
however it's done. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
You are betting against the very security that you are selling 	2-
{VOC breath}	
to that person. 	0
{VOC breath}	
You don't see any problem? 	2
sp	
You don't see that you have to disclose, when you've put together a deal 	2-
{VOC breath}	
and you go looking for people to buy those securities, 	2-
{VOC breath}	
it just adds insult to injury when your people think it's a 	2-
{VOC breath}	
pile of junk. 	2-
sp	
That - that adds insult to injury. But the - the underlying injury 	2-
{VOC breath}	
is .. that you have determined that you are gonna keep 	2
{VOC breath}	
the opposite position 	2
{VOC breath}	
from the security that you're selling to someone. 	2
{VOC breath}	
You just don't see any obligation 	2
{VOC breath}	
to disclose that. That's - 	2
	
seems to be coming through here.	x
sp	
Do they have an opinion? Do they - they - .. have an op- 	1-
sp	
a belief that you, at least when you're going out peddling securities, 	2-
{VOC breath}	
that you want that security to succeed? .. Don't they have that 	2-
{VOC breath}	
right to assume 	2-
{VOC breath}	
that if you're going out selling securities, 	2
{VOC breath}	
that you have a belief 	2
{VOC breath}	
that that's something which would be good for that client?	2
sp	
They don't want - you're out there *selling it to them. You're out there selling these securities. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
This isn't someone walking in the door. You're picking up the phone. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
You're calling all these people. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
You don't tell them that it's - 	2-
{VOC breath}	
you think it is a piece junk. You don't tell them 	2-
{VOC breath}	
that this is a security which incorporates 	2-
{VOC breath}	
or which in some way references 	1-
{VOC breath}	
a whole lot of bad stuff in your own inventory, 	2-
sp	
bad lemons, I think the word was called. 	1-
{VOC breath}	
You don't - 	2-
sp	
you don't - .. You're out there looking around. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
Over and over again, we have emails. You're out there looking around for buyers .. of stuff, .. whether it's junk or not junk, 	2
{VOC breath}	
where you are betting against what you're selling. 	2
{VOC breath}	
You are intending to keep 	2
{VOC breath}	
the opposite side. .. This isn't where you're just selling something from your inventory. 	2
{VOC breath}	
This is where you are betting against the very product you are selling, and you're just not troubled by it. That's the bottom line. 	2-
sp	
There's no trouble in your mind or heart - 	2-
sp	
It's a question, not a characterization. I'm saying, you're not troubled. 	2-
sp	
And where you are betting, .. keeping a betting interest against the security. 	2
{VOC breath}	
It's not just they're buying from you. .. That's not my issue. 	2-
sp	
They're buying something from you where you solicit them to buy .. and then you are betting against. You are keeping the short side. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
You are going out 	2
{VOC breath}	
and getting a default swap. In some way, 	2
{VOC breath}	
you are - or - or you are going on the A_B_X_ - selling the A_B_X_. 	2
{VOC breath}	
Whatever it is, 	2
{VOC breath}	
you are taking 	2
{VOC breath}	
a position against the very security 	2
{VOC breath}	
that you are selling, .. and you are not troubled.	2-
sp	
And you want people to trust you. 	3-
sp	
Why would people - ? I wouldn't trust you. 	3-
sp	
If you came to me and wanted to sell me securities 	2-
{VOC breath}	
and you didn't tell me that you have a bet against that same security -	2-
sp	
You think - you don't think that affects my thinking? 	2-
sp	
Talking about that security. Mister Blankfein, .. stick to the point. 	3
{VOC breath}	
I'm talking about that security that you're selling out there. You go out and sell that security. 	2
{VOC breath}	
Oil security, I don't care what kind it is. 	2
{VOC breath}	
And that 	0
sp	
You are betting against that same security you're out selling. I just have to keep repeating this. I'm not talking about generally in the market. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
I'm saying you got a short bet against *that security. 	2-
{VOC breath}	
You don't think the client would *care?	3-
sp	
Okay. 	x
	
This is much more than a market maker. You're keeping a proprietary interest in a position 	2
{VOC breath}	
that is .. exactly the opposite of what you are selling. 	2
{VOC breath}	
Okay, I think- we are going round and round - .. 	2
{VOC breath}	
We're going round and round on this, and I don't think we're going to get 	2
{VOC breath}	
uh an answer from you, basically that you have any concern about that kind of a situation. 	2
