Uh, thank you for being here, Mister Blankfein. Um -	0
sp	
Would you agree that the financial crisis that has brought on the .. greatest recession since the Great Depression was due to a .. collapse of the housing market?	1
sp	
And .. your involvement in the housing market is .. not .. in the direct mortgage business?	1
sp	
And you received -	1
sp	
ten billion dollars as part of TARP?	1
sp	
And why did you think you needed that money? 	1-
sp	
But you d- you didn't make any direct 	1
sp	
home loan mortgages. 	1
sp	
But .. since it was the housing market collapsed, you needed ten .. billion dollars, and 	1
sp	
you recovered rather nicely, I guess. Uh, .. I guess you declared 	1
sp	
earnings for two thousand and nine of some thirteen billion, is that -	1
sp	
Is that correct?	0
sp	
Roughly?	0
sp	
And your bonus was?	0
sp	
About nine million. Um -	0
sp	
and you're - and you're doing pretty well .. this year, too, according to your .. earnings and your .. stock.	1
sp	
You're doing pretty well this year? 	1
sp	
How do you think the community banks are doing, Mister Blankfein?	1-
sp	
I think they're doing pretty poorly. They're being closed .. all the time. .. They're the ones that .. make 	1-
sp	
the loans for the mortgages. 	0
sp	
Think they're doing okay, .. the community banks?	1-
sp	
But Goldman's doing pretty well. .. Um -	1
sp	
And one of the reasons, obviously, why Goldman's doing pretty well, 	1
sp	
before they got the ten billion dollars .. of TARP money, .. of taxpayers' money, 	2
sp	
there was a November two thousand and seven email from you that stated, .. quote, 	0
sp	
of course we didn't dodge the mortgage mess. 	0
sp	
We lost money, .. then we made more than we lost because of shorts.	0
sp	
That's a quote from your..  email that you wrote. How much .. did you make?	1
sp	
Uh, 	0
sp	
more than you lost because of shorts?	2
sp	
You know, 	0
sp	
Mister Blankfein, there's a lot of .. animosity out there. I'm sure you have uh seen that, .. and 	1
sp	
we find 	0
sp	
in my state, .. for example, .. there's forty eight percent of the homes are still under water. In other words, they are worth less, as you know, than the -	1
sp	
than the payments that are being made. .. And the community banks 	0
sp	
continue to struggle 	1
sp	
 and have great difficulties. 	1
sp	
And 	0
you received ten billion dollars in por- pa- TARP money, 	1
sp	
and the community banks are the ones that are going under. 	1
sp	
Ma- maybe you could - .. d- do you think that that - .. in the minds of a lot of Americans, that there's a - .. a - a real contradiction there? .. You're doing fine. 	1
{VOC breath}	
You're paid millions of dollars in bonuses. Perhaps you earned them. I'm not 	1
{VOC breath}	
uh, qualified to say that. Meanwhile, 	1
{VOC breath}	
community banks, the ones who were the direct lenders 	1
{VOC breath}	
in the housing market, the direct involvement, the ones that - .. Not you, 	1-
sp	
but that - that the homeowners relied on, 	1
sp	
are the ones that are struggling and - and uh still having enormous difficulty, including 	1
sp	
my home state of Arizona. Do y- do you see? Do you understand why people might think there's a 	1-
{NVC}	
dichotomy there, Mister Blankfein, that- that- or even unfairness there? 	1-
{VOC breath}	
And I understand that life isn't fair, .. but 	2
	
a lot of Americans 	1
{VOC breath}	
don't quite understand what went on there. .. They don't understand what hit em.	2
sp	
Um. 	0
sp	
And I know you're not a charitable organization. I know why you're in business. 	1
sp	
But has Goldman Sachs done anything to try to help uh these community banks and these homeowners with the - 	1
{VOC breath}	
who are struggling to make their mortgage payments? 	1
sp	
I mean, you - you did get ten billion dollars of the taxpayers' money. 	1
sp	
What about community banks? Any involvement with them?	0
sp	
{VOC mouthnoise} {VOC breath}	
sp	
Um -	0
sp	
D- Explain, .. perhaps for the benefit of the Subcommittee and for the record, 	1
sp	
what is a synthetic -	1-
sp	
C_D_O_?	1-
sp	
A synthetic C_D_O_.	0
sp	
Yeah, sorry. 	0
sp	
In other words, you really don't - .. in a synthetic -	0
sp	
um -	0
sp	
C_D_O_, you don't really have any ownership. You're just betting on the fortunes of that 	0
sp	
C_D_O_. Is that .. correct?	0
sp	
How does that .. differ from 	1-
sp	
going out to Caesar's Palace to the sports book and 	1-
{VOC start}	
making a wager on the outcome of a athletic contest? 	1-
sp	
It's been alleged in the case of the 	0
sp	
Abacus - or 'Abacus {PRN a-BAH-cus} -	0
sp	
Abacus - 	0
sp	
transaction .. that the credit agency .. was not informed 	0
sp	
that a hedge fund client was taking a short position. .. Is that true?	1-
sp	
Should it have been disclosed? 	1
sp	
The - the credit .. rating agency, the one that -	0
sp	
But 	0
	
let's assume .. that the 	0
sp	
agency .. didn't know. Is that - 	0
sp	
{VOC start} {VOC start}	
Well, you would know whether you .. informed the rating agency or not, wouldn't you?	2-
sp	
The - .. the rating agency 	2
sp	
would know whether they were told or not.	2
sp	
{VOC start} {VOC start} {VOC start}	
The rated agency - 	0
{VOC breath}	
the hedge fund c- So 	0
{VOC start}	
w- there's a difference of opinion between 	1
sp	
the hedge fund client and .. Goldman?	1
sp	
Well, 	1
sp	
the rating agency 	1
sp	
rates the C_D_O_, right? 	1
sp	
And it is alleged .. that the rating agency 	1
{NVC} 	
was not told 	1
sp	
that a hedge fun- fund client was taking a short position.	1
sp	
Well, 	1
sp	
um, a lot of these things are 	1
sp	
fairly complicated, 'Mister {PRN mist} Blankfein. Um. 	1
sp	
And a lot of Americans don't understand 	1
sp	
what happened, 	1
sp	
but they do understand 	1
sp	
that they are still hurting very badly, many of them across this country, 	1
sp	
and 	0
sp	
they believe that 	1
sp	
your handling, 	1
sp	
and other other financial institutions', 	1
sp	
of the housing market and these complicated transactions 	1
sp	
were a direct contributor to the meltdown 	1
sp	
that 	1
sp	
America experienced. 	1
sp	
And 	0
sp	
they haven't recovered. 	1
sp	
You've done pretty well. 	1
sp	
Um. 	0
sp	
I don't think that's 	2
sp	
the vision that most Americans have of what -	2
sp	
how this nation and its economy should function. 	2
sp	
I thank you, Mister Chairman. 	0
