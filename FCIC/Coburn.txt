Thank you, Mister Blankfein, for being here. Uh, I have to disagree a little bit with Senator Kaufman. 	2-
Uh ..	0
I think ninety percent of the problems associated with the meltdown in our mortgage 	1
{VOC cough} 	
system and the financial 	1
{VOC breath}	
crisis sits on the lap of Congress.	1
sp	
Um, and uh, I've .. been adamant in my view on that because you can't record the last time we had a 	1
{VOC breath}	
oversight hearing until the problems came up. We don't do oversight in advance to see whether things are working. 	1
{VOC breath} {VOC cough} .. {VOC mouthnoise}	
Having said that, let- I have a few questions for you, Mister Blankfein. 	0
{VOC breath}	
The activities that you and your employees have been called here today to testify about, is it your understanding that your competitors were engaged in similar activities? 	0
sp	
Some of them aren't here anymore, are they? 	2
sp	
Alright.	0
sp	
Did you at any time have concerns - legal, .. ethit- .. ethical, or reputational, .. about any of the activities undertaken by Goldman employees about which we have heard today? 	0
sp	
So you've not heard anything today 	2
sp	
that has concerned you 	2
sp	
about .. actions or statements 	2
{VOC start}	
by Gold- Goldman or former Goldman employees? 	1
sp	
All right. Thank you.	0
	
On Sunday, September twenty first, you made the following public statement about Goldman Sachs -	1
	
Sunday, September twenty first, two thousand eight. 	0
	
About Goldman Sachs becoming a bank holding company. 	0
	
While accelerated by market sentiment, .. our decision to be regulated by the Federal Reserve 	0
{VOC breath}	
is based on recognition that such regulation provides its members with full prudential supervision and access to permanent liquidity and funding. 	0
	
We believe that Goldman Sachs, under Federal Reserve supervision, will be regarded as an even more secure institution 	0
	
with an exceptionally clean balance sheet 	0
	
and a greater diversity of funding sources. 	0
	
Prior to September t- .. two thousand eight, did you or anyone at Goldman Sachs have plans to convert the f- bank- firm to a bank holding company? 	0
	
Yes.	0
	
Was this something that was discussed at a Board meeting? 	0
	
All right. .. And there are records of that Board meeting? 	0
	
Would you have your staff provide that to us? 	1
	
If you would, please. 	1
	
Um.	0
	
Yeah. 	0
	
L- Looking back and today, would you rather be an investment bank? 	0
	
Not - not at - 	x
	
Yes.	x
	
Rather not 	x
be under the Federal Reserve today? 	0
	
For the - the classical investment bank.	0
	
I - I think when you - in your September twenty first, two thousand eight statement, you talked about access to permanent liquidity and a greater diversity of funding sources. 	1
{VOC breath}	
Were you, in fact, referring to Goldman Sachs would be able to .. obtain access to the discount window at the Federal Reserve? 	0
	
Well, that - .. that - .. that would .. make sense to you? 	0
	
Right. 	0
	
Let - let me ask a follow-up question. Prior to September twenty second, two thousand eight, 	0
	
is it accurate to say that Goldman Sachs had temporary access to the discount window? 	0
	
All right.	0
	
Um, .. well, that - that'd be something that I'd - we'd be - I'd be interested in having -	2
{VOC start}	
Whether you did or didn't. Uh - 	2
{VOC breath}	
Have you since becoming a bank holding company accessed the discount window? 	0
	
I understand. That's - .. that's fair.	2
	
Let - let me ask you a few q- questions about the bill .. um .. that's being proposed. 	1
{VOC start}	
Your Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer said you embrace it. .. You sm- generally supportive of the Dodd bill.	1
	
Um. 	0
	
You've been fairly high profile in your support for it. 	1
	
Do you still maintain that support for this bill? 	0
	
Do you think it solves the problems that are - that caused the problems that we got into? 	0
	
I don't think so. The vote w- 	2
	
was turned down again. I don't think we've gotten there. 	2
	
W- what do you think will happen to loan origination? Uh, uh from the community banks, smaller regional banks, if they're required to 	0
{VOC brfeath}	
maintain five percent .. of every mortgage that they write? 	0
	
What do you think's gonna happen to mortgage volume? .. Let's say the housing industry comes back. 	0
{VOC breath}	
You think the small banks are going to be writing .. mortgages anymore in the future? 	0
	
Right. 	0
	
Do you have any thoughts on the fact that this bill doesn't address 	1
	
underlying core problems 	1
	
like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? 	1
	
I mean, you would agree that there was an incentive to make loans 	2
	
m- through the guar- implicit guarantee of the Federal Government to people were less qualified 	2
	
uh than what we had seen prior to the onset of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 	0
	
But you - But you would agree with an implicit Federal guarantee on a mortgage, 	2
	
that would make it more available to more people, 	2
	
because the cost of capital would go down, because of an implicit Federal guarantee behind it? 	2
	
Um, .. have you personally spoken with anybody at Treasury about the regulatory reform effort? 	0
	
Have you had - ? Let me .. place it -	0
	
Let me - let me rec- rephrase the question. 	1
	
Have you in the last six to nine months had conversations with people at Treasury about the regulatory reform effort? 	0
	
All right. 	0
	
That's fair. 	1+
	
Uh, do you know who you talked to? 	0
	
Let - let me .. change - change course for a minute. And I - I just really want to pick your brain and your judgment. 	1
	
Systemic risk, 	0
	
and the fact that it was there, 	0
	
created the necessary program for .. us to .. eliminate that systemic risk. 	1
	
The option in the Dodd bill is to tax you so that we can .. have a fund, 	1
	
uh, and I have real problems with how that fund is managed, but the idea is, is so that the government doesn't ever loan it again, 	2
{VOC breath}	
I_E_, the taxpayer, .. but, in fact, the taxpayer will, because if you're taxed, it's going to cost more to the people you do business with. 	2
	
So, what are the other ways to handle systemic risk, .. in your opinion, 	0
	
that are different than creating a taxpayer-funded fund, again, 	2-
	
that would .. limit this country's exposure to significant - significant systemic risk, 	0
	
knowing that .. as we lessen that risk, we probably also lessen some of our competitive capability worldwide in terms of financial and capital markets? 	1
	
Which means we - we - we would lim- limit your leverage ratio to ten to twelve? 	0
	
Yeah. 	0
	
Well, it's about a ten trillion dollar cost of what we've absorbed already, .. so -	1
	
(??)	
That may - that may be cheap in comparison to what we've - we've - 	1
{VOC breath}	
we've .. swallowed	1
	
Which brings to mind, do you think that the F_D_I_C_ presently has the capable staff that would be able to come in and run .. Goldman Sachs if you got into trouble? 	2
	
The answer to that is absolutely no. 	2
{VOC breath}	
Nobody is going to believe they have the capability to do that. But that's what we're setting up in this bill. 	2
	
We're going to give them broad power 	2
	
to come in. They'll pick winners and losers. They'll make the decisions. They have none of the expertise to do that, but that's who we're going to put this with. 	2
	
Yeah, but their existing functions is they take over and immediately sell the assets and they don't run things. 	2
	
Correct? 	0
	
And this bill is going to have them *running things. 	2
	
Uh, *big difference. 	2
{VOC breath}	
And while there's no question they do a good job when they close and sell the assets and open it up on Mon- close it on Friday and open it on Monday. 	2
{VOC breath}	
But they're not- there's experienced people in the banking business that are making the decisions on that, not F_D_I_C_.	2
{VOC breath}	
And they have nobody near the capability of people inside Goldman to take over Goldman and run it, 	2
{VOC breath}	
yet that's what we are writing into a bill. And you think that's a wise position? 	2
	
{VOC start} 	
No, the interaction is is we are gonna give a Federal bureaucracy the ability - who's never had any experience - to come in and run a company like Goldman Sachs, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions the world's ever known, 	3-
{VOC breath}	
they have no experience, no knowledge with how to do that, and we're going to write l- *law 	3-
{VOC breath} 	
and then they're gonna write regulations that they're gonna be able to do that, if you become too big to fail or you become a systemic risk for the rest of the financial institution. You -	3-
{VOC breath}	
you all embrace that? 	3-
	
I mean, that's totally different than anything we've heard from Goldman Sachs' business philosophy here today and what we've studied. 	3-
	
But yet you all embrace the bill? 	2
	
Well, y- you - you would agree that .. seven hundred billion dollars got allocated of taxpayer money to solve systemic risk problems, of which you were the beneficiary 	2
{VOC breath} 	
both directly and indirectly of a portion of that. 	2
	
So, somebody thought you were too big to fail. 	2
	
Yeah. 	0
	
Yeah, that- that's a legitimate point. I'd - I'd answer that. What about the idea of taking the six largest banks and making - 	2
{VOC breath} 	
uh, that do similar things to you and making them into sixty? 	2
	
With specialization over here, and this over here, where we- where we- divide up 	2
{VOC breath}	
systemic risk so we don't have systemic risk? 	2
	
You don't do the commercial side, and you don't do -	2
	
Yeah. 	0
	
Okay. I - I have one final question. And - and you are the leader of Goldman Sachs. There's no question about that, right? 	2
	
All right. 	0
	
And uh you set the tone? 	2
	
And uh I've asked a lot of questions about ethics today throughout the period. 	1
	
I - I have a question for you. 	1
	
Uh, why did Goldman Sachs decide to release the personal emails of Mister Tourre and not everybody else? 	2
	
In this hearing? 	2
{VOC breath}	
And uh it had no investigative purpose. We didn't expose any of that. 	2
{VOC breath} 	
Uh, w- we had deleted all of it. We weren't exposing it. 	2
	
Is - was that a right decision, number one? And number two, is it fair to your employee? 	2
	
And why did - why - Is that a political ploy or a defense ploy, or - ?	2
{VOC breath}	
Why - why would you do that to one of your own employees? 	2
	
Well, this committee had never released any of that information 	2
{VOC breath}	
um on him, anything that would n- give him a .. pers- into his personal life or his personal 	2
{VOC breath}	
thoughts. I - I - To me - 	2
{VOC breath} 	
I - I go back to the original question. 	2
{VOC breath}	
The tone set by that - If I worked for Goldman Sachs, I'd be real worried 	2
	
uh that - that somebody 	2
	
has made a decision, .. uh he's gonna be a whipping boy. 	2
	
Uh, he's the guy that's getting hung out to dry. Cuz nobody else had their personal emails released! 	2
{VOC breath}	
You know, you all made a d - a - a - a very distinct, discriminatory decision 	3
{VOC breath}	
that one of your employees 	3
{VOC breath}	
is going to be made to look bad, 	3
{VOC breath}	
Cuz we didn't release those emails. 	3
	
I understand that. And maybe you weren't involved in it- 	2
	
Thank you. I - I've gone over, Mister Chairman. I apologize. Mister Blankfein, thank you for your .. cooperation. 	0
