0	6B	mm-kay .
1	6B	so we start with education and programs ?
1	6B	mm-kay , so let 's see -
1	6B	i would say the sugar free juice machines . okay .
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	and then um -
1	6B	probably .
1	6B	then next one that could be cut -
1	6B	would be the poetry books , thought i 'd hate to do it . we 'd only have to cut one .
1	6B	but we could cut poetry books .
0	6B	special ed teachers , special ed classes -
1	6B	well , cooking classes i suppose -
0	6B	what do you think ?
1	6B	if we only cut one , we can only cut one from the other ones too .
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	okay , so the sugar free juice definitely gone . okay .
0	6B	public health and safety .
0	6B	hmm , okay well -

0	6B	control -
0	6B	needle exchange , uh - bagel factory inspections . ew -

0	6B	toxic waste disposal .
1	6B	yeah . yeah , that 's true .
0	6B	uh -
1	6B	and i ca n't see why s_t_d_ education ca n't be put into trunc reproductive education , bu we can - i mean - trunc yeah , but we ca n't be combining . we 're cutting .
0	6B	job training trunc oh - chicken pox vaccinations , invasive species -
0	6B	toxic waste .
1	6B	well , i suppose the one -
1	6B	i think maybe .
1	6B	bagel factory inspections , or the invasive species removal could be let go for trunc invasive species removal could be let go for awhile .
1	6B	i mean you 'll have blackberry bushes all over the place .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	yeah , hopefully - see there you could make the invasive species go into weed control just like you could have the -
1	6B	uh , reproductive - yeah , go into the reproductive .
1	6B	but -
1	6B	so we can get rid of one here .
1	6B	that 's -
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	okay . yeah . right . okay .
0	6B	so then recreation and public services . stray cat spaying -

1	6B	ca n't see why they ca n't be sorta combined .
0	6B	soup kitchen , housing assistance -
0	6B	uh - u-
1	6B	yeah , well we can take trunc maybe they are n't planning even cutting those , see ? yeah . it trunc trunc yeah .

0	6B	stray cat spaying , kitten and puppy adoption -
0	6B	food bank , junior soccer league -
0	6B	okay . so are we doing the public access and then leaving the news station ?
0	6B	okay .

0	6B	pest control -
0	6B	pest control - pest control -
0	6B	is that like ?
0	6B	mosquitos and things ? that 's mosquitos and things , right ? pest control .
1	6B	oh yeah , that 's what it is . it 's rats and - yeah . yeah . okay , we 'll go on to infrastructure and licensing .
1	6B	okay , now the hunting - hunting tags .
1	6B	the hunting tags and the fishing licenses should be together in the first place .
0	6B	and -
1	6B	yeah , tattoo artist licenses .
0	6B	additional bus stops , speed limit trunc
0	6B	teaching trunc
0	6B	drainage ditches .
2	6B	well , additional bus stops are always nice .
1	6B	but we could so without em for awhile .
1	6B	you just wonder - i mean how hard is it to get a taxi stop ? you just go out there and paint a -
1	6B	thing .
1	6B	but i mean , they need em . but it should n't be very costly . you are n't going to be saving very much with a trunc getting rid of the taxi stops .
1	6B	flag pole you repair . you sorta need it .
1	6B	but -
1	6B	well , it just depends how a big a city you have .
1	6B	does n't really say - teaching trunc seems like some of these licenses and things should all just be in the same -
1	6B	building , and the same - you know , you just go there . you get one -
1	6B	clerk and you can either get a artist license , you can get a boating license , you can get a -
0	6B	yeah
0	6B	fishing license .
1	6B	specially the fishing licenses , but they are n't having us combine things . they 're asking us what we can get rid of .
1	6B	so .
1	6B	th taxi stops -
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	okay , so we got rid of one . of each one . i think we did very well .
0	6B	yes .
1	6B	i think we 're done .
