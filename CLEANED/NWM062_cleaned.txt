0	6B	fourteen .
0	6B	fourteen -
0	6B	four -
1	6B	so , i trunc yeah . so , i would - i would say four if you took trunc uh , just arbitrarily , assuming that -
1	6B	trunc it is n't that way , but trunc assuming they all equally got the same amount of money .
1	6B	so if you made across the board cuts , as often happens , twenty five percent -
1	6B	that would mean four - four items would have to be cut from each -
1	6B	each category , so - f-
1	6B	okay . so , let 's go from -
1	6B	education and trunc math tutors .
1	6B	okay . assistant cooks .

0	6B	acting .
0	6B	acting , as in drama coaches .
2	6B	yeah , it trunc should say drama .
1	6B	i 'm - i 'm assuming . as opposed to someone -
0	6B	yeah . a trunc my first thought was - cuz it came after football , is a guy who 's , uh - uh , just trunc standing in - yeah , but that 's - that would , but -
1	6B	okay , so drama coaches . so would you keep a drama coach ?
0	6B	poe-

0	6B	bookkeeping classes .
2	6B	oh , no .

1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	okay , so that was four . let 's - so , let 's go over the four that we - we - uh , kay . we said , um , speech therapy .
0	6B	football equipment .
0	6B	cooking classes , and , um -

1	6B	public health . this i-
1	6B	yeah um -
2	6B	i - i think public - uh , reproductive education , if - when it 's done at the county level -
2	6B	is providing , um - uh , education a-
2	6B	at the clinics .
1	6B	that kind of stuff so .
0	6B	mm .
2	6B	i - i 'd - i 'd think about - uh , let 's go trunc trunc anything else in that trunc first group of six ?
0	6B	okay . toxic waste disposal - let 's see , one , two , three , four , five , six - trunc go down to veterans . so , starting with toxic waste disposal -
0	6B	hospital additions .

0	6B	uh , what was the other one that we said ?
0	6B	reproductive education , okay .
0	6B	alright .
0	6B	so , down to the last four . so we have two more to go .
0	6B	trunc uh , egg farm regulations .
0	6B	weed control .
2	6B	okay . that 's three . yeah , i 'd agree with that one .
1	6B	okay . of the trunc three trunc in that group - egg farm regulations , weed control , and pre-natal checkups .
1	6B	kay , let 's go back up - let 's go to the top of the list , so just one more .

1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	uh , invasive spe-
2	6B	you know , i - i would hate -
1	6B	out of that list , i would go with the trunc in - cut out the invasive species removal .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	uh - you know , you 're - yeah , i know trunc there 's a problem with , uh , walnut trees , and with , um -
1	6B	certain apple trees -
1	6B	and also with , um -
0	6B	uh , trunc let 's see . there was a - another kinda tree .
0	6B	trunc walnut -
0	6B	oh . did n't know about that one .
1	6B	okay . so we got - we got -
1	6B	we got four .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	okay .

0	6B	that 's four ! okay , veterinary hospital , pest control -
1	6B	trunc yeah , trunc actually , trunc those are the ones that we said before . okay .
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing .
1	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	uh-
2	6B	well , you know trunc the problem is , though -
2	6B	well , i do n't know how much of a problem it is now , but when i was teaching -
2	6B	you had , uh , holes in your staff .
2	6B	and , um , you could n't find someone who was qualified -
2	6B	in a certain trunc for example , to teach , uh , primary school .
2	6B	so you have upper elementary , which is four through six -
2	6B	but you needed a teacher who uh , you know uh , could do kindergarten through -
2	6B	grade three , then none of them are trunc no s-
2	6B	certified , so -
2	6B	as an emergency , what they would do is take a teacher from -
2	6B	the upper grades and move them down to the lower grades not a good idea , but it 's done trunc was done all the time . i think it 's still being done .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yep .
2	6B	kay , speed limit signs . need that . right ?
1	6B	additional bus - oh , we cut the bus stu-
0	6B	tattoo artist licenses ?
1	6B	uh , boating licenses . that 's - trunc trunc ?
0	6B	subway system .
1	6B	hunting tags , that 's -
2	6B	trunc was that - when your car is towed , though -
2	6B	well , i know , but they - but you have - uh , trunc there is some costs -
2	6B	well , like , trunc uh , let 's - let 's - again , this is a hypothetical .
2	6B	if they 're - if , uh , the county is providing that -
2	6B	then you would have to , uh -
1	6B	uh-huh .
1	6B	yeah so you would cut towing service-
1	6B	yeah , i do n't know enough about that one to really - massage certificates .
2	6B	i have a friend who 's a massage - she 's a licensed therapist .
2	6B	yeah she - she is really - if you do n't regulate that , what happens is it gets - it gets - goes sideways on you pretty fast .
2	6B	flagpole trunc oh , we - and taxi stops , we 'd can that .
1	6B	fishing licenses , that 's revenue . upkeep -
1	6B	keep that and drainage ditches . so , i think we had four . trunc yeah , that 's four .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	you trunc you know , the reality - the reality of - of - cutting items is that every single item on the budget -
2	6B	has a constituency .
2	6B	you know . and - and the ones that you say , okay , let 's say , it 's real obvious , flagpole repair -
2	6B	then the veteran group would come out of the woodwork and say how can you desecrate the american flag ? and -
2	6B	you know . i - and i mean , that 's how it would trunc uh , that 's how it 'd go . i mean , you know .
2	6B	ah - actually , there is - there trunc there is a - there is a law about flying the flag in public buildings .
2	6B	you trunc trunc well , a state law . yeah . i - i do n't - trunc i do n't think there 's a federal law , but there is a state law .
0	6B	but you have to do it .
2	6B	so - but , if you cut it - i mean , if it was something you could cut -
2	6B	and you cut it -
2	6B	nobody would come after you .
2	6B	you know . there trunc there - there are laws out there that are not enforced all the time .
2	6B	look at the marijuana laws -
2	6B	cracks me up .
2	6B	okay , it 's legal to have what , an ounce of marijuana on you right ? whatever it is .
2	6B	but , it is illegal to buy it !
2	6B	now think about that for a second .
2	6B	so where are you trunc so -
2	6B	the only way - yeah .
2	6B	the only way - uh , and people with medical marijuana are - were already covered .
2	6B	you know , under the , uh - under the trunc medical marijuana .
2	6B	so anyone who is not under that can carry , um , a - an ounce , or whatever it is , of marijuana .
2	6B	but you ca n't buy it . you ca n't legally buy it . and i just think that 's really hilarious . and they were talking about that in colorado . it 's the same problem .
2	6B	that 's the problem here , too .
2	6B	well , no , it 's -
2	6B	no , it 's - it 's trunc it 's not drug dealers , per se . what they 're - trunc trunc trunc trunc trunc what they 're - uh , trunc you ca n't do - trunc the problem is , because -
2	6B	it 's a controlled substance under federal -
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	right . trunc it 's not the m-
2	6B	well , yeah . trunc so , you need to change the law at the federal level .
2	6B	we 'll see . we 'll see . you know , it 's gon na be interesting .
2	6B	yes and no . they 've - uh , the problem is , all of the banks currently in the state of trunc we 've done away pretty much with state regulation .
2	6B	you 'd have to institute a whole new set of laws .
2	6B	cuz all of them are - you know , the - f_ - trunc if the feds are involved - f_d_i_c insured , or -
2	6B	uh , trunc uh , trunc uh , what is it , credit union ? uh , you know , that 's all federal regulation , so if they 're at all regulated by the feds in any way , shape , or form -
2	6B	they trunc they wo n't touch it . it was a bank , uh , trunc in , uh , seattle -
2	6B	that was willing - you know , the bank president said our board , they 're - they 're willing to be the bank , and then they reneged about a week later . they said no , we ca n't do it because of the trunc controlled substance for the federal - we would lose our license , an-
3	6B	of course they did !
3	6B	they - trunc that was one trunc yeah , that was one of the - that was one of the basic issues in the campaign . you know ? uh , i mean , against it was -
1	6B	was that , um , you know , it 's a violation of the federal law .
1	6B	then we went ahead and did it anyway .
2	6B	yeah . it 's regulation by the state . that 's - that 's right .
2	6B	but - you know - the problem is , like trunc they were saying in trunc oh , it 's true in this state too , but they - they , uh - you know -
2	6B	trunc you pay your - your employee -
2	6B	and you 're gon na pay them , uh , six hundred dollars . it 's trunc it 's all cash .
3	6B	that 's crazy .
3	6B	that is so crazy !
0	6B	anyway .
