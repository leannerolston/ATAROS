2	3I	oh you could travel with em or camp with em or wear em as trunc this is the one that i think is interesting , box knives . tsk . 
0	3I	the only people i know who use box knives are the people who people these shelves . um 
2	3I	well maybe with the mouse traps , that 's one of those - and we 've got more utility here cuz rolls of ducks - 
0	3I	and let's see , tow ropes - 
1	3I	huh over there . okay , and trunc this is - this is another one . and our precut wood . 
2	3I	sounds good to me i think we have an empty box . 
0	6B	well . 
0	6B	for trunc maybe it's in the schools . 
0	6B	yeah , when i was a kid  we were the assistant cooks . 
1	6B	well , i would sort of - 
1	6B	start out with the sugar-free juice machines . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	and . 
1	6B	i 'm sorta thinking - 
0	6B	how many are there ? there are three , six , nine . 
0	6B	fifteen . so if we took five from each one it would be a third of a - 
1	6B	that might be a little excessive , huh ? 
1	6B	okay . 
0	6B	okay 
2	6B	so that makes it a lot easier . cuz we can get rid of sugar for juice machines . 
1	6B	well , we can get rid of - 
1	6B	in my opinion we can get rid of football equipment . 
2	6B	well , it - 
1	6B	yeah trunc trunc home ec . 
2	6B	well , and i - i don't know if this is adult education as well , it may be , teaching people who are diabetic to cook in a responsible way . um . we like the music teachers . probably math tutors are pretty good . sex education , i think is critical . 
1	6B	maybe . we could have the kids in the schools do the assisting . or they could be custodians . 
0	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	trunc well , quite honestly you probably could cut that one cuz you could just buy quicken . 
2	6B	takes care of it . 
1	6B	well , for starters we 're trunc going to do the three sugar , football equipment . 
1	6B	and assistant cooks ? okay . 
0	6B	we did three . we 're done . 
2	6B	let's see , reproductive education we definitely need that chicken pox vaccinations , i like . 
2	6B	invasive species removal , i 'm in favor of . 
2	6B	s_t_d_ we definitely need that . toxic waste disposal , gosh we kinda need that . hospital additions . probably need that . 
1	6B	well , i - you know , i don't like bagels so it 'd be fine with me if we didn't do bagel factory inspections . 
1	6B	well maybe they inspect them for kosherness , i dunno . 
0	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	well they wanna know if we say bagel like my sister does in new york city . yeah . she says bagel . needle exchange , we 'd like that . i think a sex offender database is really pretty useless quite honestly but veteran's medal . well , you can't cut that cuz then the human cry would go off . 
1	6B	egg farm regulations . well , neighborhood watch support , i 'm afraid they 've cut that already . 
1	6B	i was gonna say neighbors do it , we - on their own , yeah . so we 're - we can get rid of that one , can't we ? and then we - i 'm happy to get rid of bagel factories . yeah . yeah . so we just have to find one more . 
1	6B	well and i guess if i were looking at this i 'd look at hospital additions . 
2	6B	children's has just finished theirs , they don't need another one . 
1	6B	yeah , yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . i agree . i agree .  now . we did three there . so recreation and public services . let's see . what is a public news sta- ? oh , is that like k_ u_ o_ w_ ? 
0	6B	oh yeah ! 
0	6B	get on . yeah . one in the nude as i recall . 
2	6B	well if it's that i could get rid of that . that would be alright with me . i wouldn't wanna get rid of k_u_o_w_ . uh . 
1	6B	yeah . and , i dunno . junior soccer league . i dunno if we need that . 
2	6B	um , well here . i think the boys' basketball club . they don't have a girls' anything . 
2	6B	so i think we trunc don't fund that until they make it co-ed . yeah . yeah . um . trunc 
1	6B	oh , okay . 
2	6B	oh okay , let's get rid of the public access . yeah . there 's - we don't need that . um . 
2	6B	see , i 'm not a big football fan . i 'd probably get rid of the football stadium upkeep . 
2	6B	pest control we need , spaying we need . uh , food banks we need . kitten and puppy adoption i guess we don't need but we 've got all those puppies and kittens because nobody's spaying . 
1	6B	and neutering their cats . 
1	6B	it is , yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	that 's where we 've gotten all our pets . soup kitchens we need . housing assistance . 
2	6B	well , i trunc how about boys' basketball and leave junior soccer ? it's very popular now and - 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	and then , uh - 
0	6B	the public access . 
2	6B	mm-hm . and then we can choose trunc as far as i 'm concerned , either football stadium - 
1	6B	or - 
0	6B	huh . 
2	6B	veterinary hospital . why would we have to be supporting the veterinary hospital if we 're supporting the spaying and neutering ? 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	well , i trunc i could cut the veterinary hospital probably . 
0	6B	is that our three ? okay . 
2	6B	oh , licensing . well , pothole maintenance we definitely need . uh . 
2	6B	subway system . interesting , since we don't have one really in seattle . but - 
1	6B	trunc well , then we 'd like that . well , could we agree on flagpole repair not being the highest priority ? 
1	6B	way down there . okay , so that 's one we could get rid of . 
2	6B	um . additional bus stops . since they 're cutting our bus services right and left maybe we don't need additional stops . 
2	6B	well as long as they 're not funding the busses , it doesn't do much good . might be chicken and egg , i don't know . now , what is a massage certificate ? is that a license to practice massage therapy ? oh , i suppose what's the greater public good ? fishing licenses , massage certificates , tattoo artist licenses ? 
1	6B	speed limit signs , i guess we need cuz people keep - 
2	6B	now , why do we have to pay for taxi stops ? 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	no . 
0	6B	right . 
1	6B	yeah , i was gonna say the - the port oughta run that . okay . so we 're gonna get rid of taxi stops and flagpole repair . 
1	6B	and then what else , do we think we could do ? additionally bus stops ? 
1	6B	is that okay ? alright . that 's our three . 
1	6B	we 're done . 
2	6B	good liberals that we are . 
2	6B	oh , somebody would .
