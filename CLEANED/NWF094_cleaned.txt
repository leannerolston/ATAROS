1	3I	can go with - 
1	3I	beans . 
1	3I	i guess . 
1	3I	especially - shoelaces . 
2	3I	now , i feel like this could go - either with clothes or home depot .

1	3I	it's just in - 
1	3I	sure . 
2	3I	yeah , winner . fishing nets . boats .

2	3I	juice . there . 
2	3I	wait , with water . um . 
2	3I	we 're running out of room . we 'd have to put it here . or here . 
3	3I	uh . woops ! sorry . i 'm a bull in a china shop . kay . 
2	3I	bundles of sticks . oh , there was wood . yeah . 
0	3I	that trunc okay . wetsuits .

1	3I	maybe , trunc paper . 
1	3I	empty plastic jugs . pfft i dunno . 
0	3I	a jug as in something you drink out of ? or a jug as - well , i guess that - i dunno what other kinda jug there is , actually . 
1	3I	maybe with the - 
2	3I	doughnuts . with - cookies . they should be with bagels cuz they 're like the same except this one's - worse for you i guess . 
0	3I	heavy coats . 
2	3I	that 's where i would look for them , i dunno about you . tweezers . 
1	3I	in the bathroom area , i guess . 
1	3I	okay . 
0	3I	electric heaters . 
0	3I	yeah , where is that ? oh . 
0	3I	oops . 
0	3I	whiskey . 
1	3I	should go - 
2	3I	it should be against the water because you should have water when you drink whiskey , too . yeah . um , peat moss . 
0	3I	um . 
2	3I	probably around here . tubing's all alone . 
0	3I	mm hats . 
1	3I	i guess . 
1	3I	maybe here . next to the toilet paper . peas . 
2	3I	this is gonna be in the fishnets . and then we left these two here . cups , probably with the jugs . i don't know where we would put five pound weights . 
2	3I	just cause this is the random - 
1	3I	where is that ? oh . okay . sure . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	yep . 
2	3I	we are finished . wow . this room though . 
2	3I	they  are far . 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	mm . 
1	6B	okay . 
1	6B	yeah , and also like - 
0	6B	where are like - okay , if it's education and programs so then we 're talking about like - 
0	6B	like , the lunch lady ? 
0	6B	that could be . 
1	6B	yeah . i agree . 
1	6B	i dunno . it can be important but - 
1	6B	i feel like - 
1	6B	i dunno . 
1	6B	yeah , probably true . 
2	6B	not really needed . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	acting coaches . cuz , trunc i mean you can have like drama directory without acting coaches , yeah . i think we should cut that . 
1	6B	maybe . okay . poetry books . 
1	6B	yeah , they don't really cost much . i mean , they don't have to . 
1	6B	special ed trunc yeah . 
1	6B	i think so , too . cooking classes ? 
0	6B	i - yeah , i wonder if it's like for the cafeteria or something like that . and then . 
2	6B	i dunno , i feel like cooking classes is not really super necessary for - 
2	6B	being - 
2	6B	you know - 
2	6B	paid for with - 
0	6B	like - 
2	6B	tax money . 
1	6B	i dunno . 
0	6B	really ? 
2	6B	sometimes you can and sometimes you can't . like it depends . 
2	6B	mm , no like if you 're blind or - like there 's this one girl wh- 
0	6B	well you have someone help you . 
1	6B	i dunno . i trunc well , like trunc i - there 's this one guy i know who did note taking for a blind guy and then he would type them all up . and then the blind guy had a computer system that read them for him . 
2	6B	which is kinda cool . 
2	6B	i think it's nice . 
0	6B	sugar free juice machines . 
2	6B	i dunno that seems weird to me . no . 
1	6B	i agree . yeah . 
1	6B	that 's probably kind of important . i mean . 
0	6B	as in like learning how to - ? 
0	6B	keep track of money , maybe ? 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	i think so . music teachers . 
1	6B	music teachers ? yeah . 
1	6B	definitely . okay . so we 're cutting - 
1	6B	yeah , the juice machines . and maybe also the acting coaches . so maybe those two things ? 
1	6B	okay . 
2	6B	which , i 'm not sure how that 's - yeah i think it's pretty much the same . 
0	6B	so - 
2	6B	i dunno , we could - 
2	6B	i feel like that could be potentially - 
1	6B	yeah . job training programs . mm-hm . chicken pox vaccinations . mm-hm . invasive - 
0	6B	removal ? um - 
1	6B	okay . 
2	6B	yeah . that 's what i 'm wondering like couldn't you just put it all in the same - ? 
1	6B	class ? 
1	6B	oh , okay . apparently . 
1	6B	yeah . toxic waste disposal . very important . 
1	6B	probably also kind of important . needle exchange . 
0	6B	i don't know . i guess at first i kinda thought like when we were talking before i felt like needle exchange meant - 
0	6B	like a needle recycling program ? 
0	6B	like inside the hospitals ? but i dunno if it's something different from that . 
1	6B	i feel like it's - could be kind of important . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	okay . 
1	6B	yeah . i think so . 
1	6B	veterans' medical assistance . i think that 's probably important . 
1	6B	i agree . 
2	6B	well the question is - 
2	6B	public spaces . 
0	6B	uh - 
2	6B	trunc yeah . but is - but is the weed control part of caring it - for it ? i have no idea . 
0	6B	i dunno . 
1	6B	well that 's true . 
1	6B	okay , i dunno . let's just leave it . mm-kay . 
1	6B	um . hm . interesting . neighborhood watch support . 
1	6B	that 's probably a good thing to have . 
1	6B	and then people can be connected with the police or whatever . 
2	6B	okay so i feel like we could probably take out both the s_t_d_ education and the reproductive education if we 're gonna keep sex ed over here . 
1	6B	kay . mm-hm . 
1	6B	trunc actually . 
1	6B	they do . really fast . 
2	6B	oh , really ? oh my word . 
0	6B	just like wild ones , all over the place ? 
0	6B	uh . 
1	6B	wow . 
1	6B	good to know . 
1	6B	plus , i mean . do people really even - pay attention to them ? 
1	6B	that 's true . 
1	6B	okay , we can come back to that . trunc k- 
1	6B	yes , the food bank . i agree . 
1	6B	okay . kitten and puppy adoption . yeah . 
1	6B	i know . 
2	6B	definitely need that one . okay soup kitchens . so d- 
1	6B	yeah , cuz if - yeah . 
1	6B	to take home stuff . yeah . soup kitchens . yeah . 
0	6B	i think it's like - 
2	6B	well , maybe . i think it's more like if you - if you 're like - needing , food bank . and soup kitchen - 
2	6B	stuff . and you might also need housing assistance like to - kinda help you pay for your house trunc or some kinda housing until you can pay for it yourself . 
2	6B	so that could be kind of a good think . i think . 
0	6B	kay , dog catcher . 
1	6B	i think that 's helpful . 
0	6B	boys' basketball club . 
0	6B	i actually don't know . 
0	6B	yeah , i don't know . 
2	6B	yeah , something . veterinary hospital . i don't think veterinary hospital should be a government thing , i think that should be private . 
2	6B	i think we trunc i think we should cut it . 
1	6B	or well - unless it's - unless they need them to do the trunc stray cat spaying . 
0	6B	oh , i don't really know how those systems work . 
2	6B	yeah . football stadium . that should be - i think that should be done privately too , personally . 
1	6B	and pest control . we can keep that , right ? 
1	6B	doesn't that kinda go with cat spaying ? i mean not that cats are pets cuz they 're not , but - 
1	6B	yeah . mm-hm . 
0	6B	oh , yeah . uh . 
0	6B	we - 
1	6B	the football stadium and the veterinary hospital ? 
2	6B	well , except trunc then if - i was like thinking that the cat spaying is public . they probably need - 
2	6B	at least one . so maybe we should - 
1	6B	yeah . yeah , i think so . 
2	6B	and the football stadium - upkeep . 
1	6B	so those two things ? 
2	6B	i think that 's good . 
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing . 
1	6B	yeah , i think so . 
2	6B	oh , that would be fun ! 
0	6B	oh . 
0	6B	i didn't even know that - the tattoo artists had to be licensed . 
2	6B	that 's weird . 
2	6B	i - i personally - i think i would cut that and just - i mean if they wanna - 
0	6B	i don't - 
0	6B	know if they fund it but they must - maybe they r- 
0	6B	maybe in this false scenario they trunc they regulate tattoo artists ? 
1	6B	maybe in a real scenario they do . i dunno , i feel very uneducated . yeah . 
1	6B	okay . 
0	6B	boating licenses . 
1	6B	keep that ? 
1	6B	okay . 
2	6B	well , yeah . 
1	6B	yeah , that 's true . but i think that means like the government keeps track of who has boats and who doesn't . 
2	6B	and i think that 's what it means about this , too . the tattoo artists . it means like the government keeps track of who trunc whose doing tattoos and how they 're doing it . 
0	6B	yeah , it means we 're allowing them to . and if they 're doing it without - 
0	6B	a license then they 're not allowed to do the boating or the tattooing . 
2	6B	but if we don't even  fund licenses then people can just do whatever they want . 
2	6B	we can come back to it . pothole maintenance . yes , very important . 
2	6B	you can't . it's pretty helpful . 
2	6B	okay let's just keep it . hunting tags . that goes along with other licensing things . 
0	6B	that 's - that 's government regulating . who's hunting and when . 
2	6B	we 're  pretending . 
1	6B	well that 's true . 
2	6B	i dunno . massage certificates . this is weird . taxi stops ? 
1	6B	i don't think . 
2	6B	not on the east coast . 
0	6B	on the east coast they have trunc some places they have specific like - this is a taxi stop and then all the taxi trunc drivers will pull up and you can like get on . 
0	6B	or in . and pay for a taxi . 
2	6B	i guess so . but we don't have them here . but we don't know where we 're at , so - fishing licenses . 
0	6B	public bus upkeep . 
2	6B	probably kind of important . especially if we 're gonna - additional bus stops . 
0	6B	drainage dishes ? 
2	6B	kind of important . yeah . i think we could probably - 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	i think people trunc do tattooing without licenses anyway . 
2	6B	so we may as well just cut it . 
2	6B	it's probably safer to get one  with someone who's licensed ? but maybe you should just do trunc your research before doing it anyway . 
1	6B	okay . okay . 
2	6B	maybe taxi stops since we don't really have any of them here . and people can just call the taxi and meet them wherever . the corner . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	mm-kay . are we good ? 
1	6B	we 're done . 
2	6B	awesome sauce .
