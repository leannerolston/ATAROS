2	3I	our cold stuff would be -
2	3I	sticks of butter .
1	3I	bottles of juice might be refrigerated .
2	3I	think this 'll be our dairy type items .
2	3I	so butter goes typically with dairy in a grocery store .
1	3I	sure .
2	3I	the bottles of trunc bottles of juice goes next to sticks of butter .
1	3I	sure let 's put the liters - was that ? the liters of water -
2	3I	so this - this aisle seems like this a food aisle .
2	3I	so sugar would be baking items -
2	3I	yeah , that 's true , so chocolate bars , pouches of oatmeal -
1	3I	i think -
2	3I	packages of cookies , those are all baked goods .
0	3I	let 's see here , so -
1	3I	cake mix is a -
1	3I	introduction to baked goods .
2	3I	we could put those things together .
2	3I	pa. well , the three of these things are made , so packages of cookies , boxes of donuts , and bagels .
0	3I	mmhm .
2	3I	the dried figs .
2	3I	sure , that works for me .

1	3I	how bout trunc packages of cookies on top .
1	3I	sure .
1	3I	and then was it boxes of donuts ?
1	3I	yeah , that one works and then bagels ?
0	3I	okay .
2	3I	wan na put the chocolate bars be-
1	3I	the dried figs , the chocolate bars and pouches of oatmeal ? that works for me .
1	3I	not really , okay , so -
1	3I	first one how bout - ?
1	3I	chocolate bars next to cake mix ?
1	3I	pouches of oatmeal and then dried figs -
0	3I	the soy beans ?
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	uh , how bout soy beans , then cans of peas ? that work ?
1	3I	and beets .
1	3I	and then the cases of whiskey - ?
1	3I	oh , we can fill it in later . i still like the idea of putting that next to toys .
2	3I	so , refrigerator magnets , i think that would be a good - uh , egg timers would be good thing to put with that .
1	3I	it does n't mater to me which way -
2	3I	trunc if we put it above it has more space .
1	3I	does n't really matter .
1	3I	and then we 've got toilet paper so -
0	3I	we have a whole bathroom section
0	3I	let 's see , we 've got bars of soap mint toothpaste , face cream , and tweezers .
1	3I	let 's fill in between toilet paper and refrigerator magnets .
0	3I	the tweezers .

1	3I	i do n't care .
2	3I	i actually do n't even like whiskey .
2	3I	um , we could put the trunc let 's put the books and toys together .
0	3I	those are things that my son likes to strew all over the house .
0	3I	scissors .
0	3I	i imagine like the big red dixie cups you see the college kids drinking trunc out of .
2	3I	we could put them down here .
2	3I	the toilet paper and the cups and loose leaf paper .
1	3I	sure .
1	3I	yeah , that works . so we 've got scissors , loose leaf paper , large cups , and toilet paper .
2	3I	i think we 've got a big section here where we can put clothing .

2	3I	then thinking we should go toward feet .
1	3I	so , probably -
2	3I	let 's put the shoelaces and the hats together because those are -
2	3I	accessory type items . socks , fleece lined boots .
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	that works .
2	3I	i think it looks pretty good like that .
1	3I	should we just pick an arbitrary spot ?
1	3I	tween bagels and soybeans ?
0	3I	ah .
1	3I	maybe just way up here .
0	3I	okay , so looking at these items -

2	3I	yeah , we do n't really have any .
1	3I	well , the cable and -
1	3I	sure .
1	3I	so let 's do our - let 's place our boating supplies type things first .
1	3I	i do n't have any preference . uh , so tow ropes because those go -
1	3I	with boating supplies .
2	3I	and the trunc fishing net and fishing hooks probably together .

0	6B	acting coaches , poetry books , special ed . teachers -
0	6B	cooking classes , note takers , disability services -

1	6B	alright .
0	6B	reproductive education -
2	6B	job training programs , chicken pox vaccinations - i 'm a big vaccination believer .
2	6B	they seem - well they seem the same to me . so , it seems like we trunc that invasive species removal and weed control are redundant .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	yeah , so let 's take weed control out of public health and safety , and leave the invasive species removal . um -
0	6B	sex trunc sex offender database , the veterans medical assistance -
2	6B	prenatal check-ups , and neighborhood watch support , those all seem important .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	along with hospital - hospital additions , and needle exchange , so let 's trunc leave those for now .
0	6B	mm-hm .

2	6B	i 'm guessing that 's what that is . foodbanks are essential .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	i think is critical .
2	6B	it needs to stay .
2	6B	uh , foodbank is very important item for public services .
1	6B	think should stay . the veterinary hospital -
2	6B	i would be inclined to get rid of the boys basketball club because you do n't see a girls basketball club .
2	6B	is not gender specific , so it - leave that .
0	6B	the stadium upkeep ?
2	6B	the boys can play in the basketball - they find a good cul-de-sac .
0	6B	teaching certificates .
0	6B	the tattoo artist licenses .

1	6B	so hunting tags can stay . subway system -
1	6B	go lightrail .
0	6B	um , pothole maintenance
2	6B	that definitely needs to stay . um , boating licenses , tattoo artist licenses -
0	6B	additional bus stops .
0	6B	speed limit signs .
2	6B	um , i would say get rid of the towing services .
0	6B	it 's trunc right next to the - the bus and the train station .
0	6B	i do n't know how much -
0	6B	i do n't know . it 's only about four spots worth .
0	6B	not even in a high density area .
0	6B	was it ? yeah , the weed control .
1	6B	okay , so we 've gotten rid of one in each category . do we want to go for a second ?
1	6B	well they have -
2	6B	in public health and safety , there 's the reproductive education , and the s_t_d_ education .
2	6B	assuming those are the same thing . we could get rid of -
1	6B	yes .
2	6B	let 's get rid of the -
2	6B	acting coaches .
0	6B	in education and programs .
1	6B	sure .
0	6B	oh , did we pick one in there already ? i was kidding about math tutors .
2	6B	i still have my eye on that community news ads .
2	6B	yeah , but then they 're - all things being equal .
2	6B	public drainage ditches , we need .
1	6B	we could get rid of those , um , taxi stops .
1	6B	okay .
0	6B	alright , so we 've cut -
0	6B	we 've cut two from each one .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	if we increase the stray cat spaying , we wo n't need any of the kitty adoption .
2	6B	increase the dog catcher .
0	6B	okay , think we 're done .
