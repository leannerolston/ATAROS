0	3I	so -
1	3I	yeah . at least they have all the food stuffs in one .
1	3I	would it be helpful to spread everything out on the table ?
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	uh-huh .
0	3I	there are oatmeals and pouches .
0	3I	and they have gas powered trunc cook stoves .
0	3I	so -
0	3I	hm .
0	3I	books .
1	3I	i do n't have a particular -
1	3I	or - it 's just kinda a loose grouping of like well these seem to go together .
1	3I	then that should go with those , right ?
1	3I	these should go together .
0	3I	mm-hm .
0	3I	so -
1	3I	maybe we could like -
1	3I	look at -
1	3I	outliers or something .
1	3I	these seem to got well .
0	3I	hm .
2	3I	box knives . i 'd put them more with like - small trunc small tools like -
1	3I	tweezers and - those are -
1	3I	but those go with -
1	3I	cuz scissors , right ?
0	3I	uh-huh .
1	3I	yeah . well i 'm thinking that 's no trunc could also go with face - face cream though .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	how bout scissors ? those go with -
2	3I	yeah . those are just weird .
0	3I	tow rope-y things .
0	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	yeah . or - what do you do with wetsuits ? i suppose they could go with fish hooks .
1	3I	baking supplies ? or house hold supplies ?
0	3I	uh -
1	3I	yeah . those seem to go well .
1	3I	camping-ish . yeah .
1	3I	electric heaters . yeah .
2	3I	mm-kay . so if we 're doing kind of a camping-ish thing then backpacks should go in here .
1	3I	matches . i 'm not sure if those should go with -
1	3I	household supplies or -
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	yeah . sure .
1	3I	you 're right .
1	3I	i do n't know . we can put those down kind of in the weird stuff that need a -
1	3I	and these are books and loose leaf . yeah .
1	3I	much better .
0	3I	mm .
1	3I	that all seems like a logical grouping to me , right ?
1	3I	and then - would - these kinda things be - ?
1	3I	more -
1	3I	together like - sweet things -
1	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	these are all -
1	3I	beverages , right ?
1	3I	oh , yeah , that 's right . we have to contend with that too .
1	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	that 's a weird thing .
0	3I	mm-hm .
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	would sticks of butter then go with the sugar ?
1	3I	alright . let 's put it there .
0	3I	i trunc
2	3I	an - naw . i think it goes on that .
0	3I	that -
2	3I	on - no . no
0	3I	oh .
1	3I	i 'm not sure .
1	3I	this is true .
1	3I	okay . let 's do that .
0	3I	an -
1	3I	seems like the -
1	3I	be the easiest thing , right ? these would seem to go with ice cream , right ? with all the sweets together .
1	3I	and chocolate .
1	3I	well that would be frozen , right ?
0	3I	mm-hm .
2	3I	eh that makes sense to me . cuz - whiskey with smooth vanilla ice cream and it is lovely .
1	3I	oh yeah .
0	3I	but -
0	3I	mm-hm .
0	3I	an ingredient ?
0	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	you know these seem to be good together cuz they 're - they 're -
1	3I	you know , they 're breakfast-y
1	3I	probably . yeah .
1	3I	legumes .
0	3I	juice , water , whisky .
1	3I	that 's right .
1	3I	ranging everything alphabetically .
1	3I	what would seem that . so we have a boating supply up there .
0	3I	that -
1	3I	that seems that these kinds of things would go with them , right ?
0	3I	alright .
1	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	yeah . seems right .
1	3I	and maybe loose leaf paper and books up by the travel guides ?
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	yeah . cuz these all kinda would group around mouse traps , right ?
1	3I	unless we go over here and put that with .
1	3I	that a bit better ?
0	3I	alright .
2	3I	oh yeah . all that 's just kind of weird - things .
1	3I	is it ? oh yeah .
1	3I	yeah . makes sense .
1	3I	let 's put that up over here .
0	3I	camp supply stuff .
1	3I	this store 's heavy into camping .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	all through here , yeah ?
0	3I	mm .
1	3I	the whisky goes by toys , right ?
0	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	okay . i can -
1	3I	they - they go with that .
1	3I	if it works for the nakatas then -
0	3I	huh .
0	3I	mm-hm ,
1	3I	well let 's see if we can split this group up into something smaller then .
1	3I	like - this could go with it , right ?
1	3I	these are more tools .
1	3I	these are burnable things .
0	3I	mm-hm .
0	3I	yeah .
0	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	i think it 's probably trunc yeah it 's probably easier to split these guys up into then other stuff .
1	3I	they might work with -
1	3I	like in here ?
0	3I	and then -
1	3I	wood product with them ?
0	3I	okay .
1	3I	that makes these guys kinda weirdos -
1	3I	now . which can go in here .
0	3I	and then -
1	3I	let 's put some order to these .
0	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	that looks good .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	here . we can do a transition with backpacks and toys .
0	3I	matches . buckets .
2	3I	damn you buckets !
1	3I	here .
1	3I	let 's move that up .
2	3I	oops . ca n't touch the mouse traps .
1	3I	okay .
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	those go underneath the -
1	3I	yeah . i thin so .
1	3I	okay .
0	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	mm . yeah i guess so .
2	3I	ca n't - do that though because the - eggs are stuck .
0	3I	yeah .
2	3I	they 're fixed .
1	3I	oh of the - the dried figs we just kind of like eh . you do n't belong with anyone .
0	3I	i think we put those there .
0	3I	mm-hm .
2	3I	no i 'm - i 'm a - i agree . dried figs should be ostracized .
1	3I	if they were raisins they should be just completely left alone .
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	uh . i -
1	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	yeah . i guess so .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	alright . five seems like a good -
1	6B	base number . yeah .
0	6B	education and programs . math tutors , assistant cooks , sex ed , custodians . speech therapy , football equipment , acting coaches , poetry books , special ed teachers , cooking classes , note takers . sugar free juice machines , bookkeeping classes , and music teachers .
2	6B	yeah the sugar free book - sugar free juice machines do n't really seem like a huge priority here .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	um .
1	6B	i 'm not a huge fan of football equipment .
1	6B	although , i do also - recognize that it 's -
0	6B	the -
1	6B	way it works within the system to keep kids in - school . mm .
1	6B	can .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	not yet .
0	6B	mm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	that 'd be a good thing .
0	6B	mm .
0	6B	if they need a -
2	6B	computerized blocking sled . then i do n't think they need that .
2	6B	but it calculates the force vectors automatically .
2	6B	yeah . bookkeeping classes probably could go . i do n't think -
2	6B	that 's becoming pretty much automated now , right ?
0	6B	mm-mm .
1	6B	assistant cooks . yeah .
0	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	trunc cooking classes .
2	6B	holistically are - more - important .
2	6B	cuz if you know how to cook then you do n't have to go to mcdonald 's .
1	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	it 's a lesser thing than a teacher . yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	juice .
2	6B	the trunc sugar free juice .
1	6B	the bookkeeping . yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	i think that 's a good thing .
0	6B	public health and safety .
2	6B	reproductive ed , job training program , chicken pox vaccinations , invasive species removal , s_t_d_ education , toxic waste disposal . goodness , it 's gon na be hard to - do five . except for those bagel factory inspections .
0	6B	hospital additions , needle exchange , sex offender database .
0	6B	vets medical , egg farm , weed control , prenatal .
0	6B	neighborhood watch support .
0	6B	mm .
2	6B	yeah .
2	6B	we can deal with dirty bagels .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	now , would n't reproductive ed and s_t_d_ ed go in the - hand and hand .
2	6B	one would hope .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	i think that weed control can go .
2	6B	especially if you 're looking at -
1	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	or however if you - kept .
2	6B	if you kept invasive species removal that takes care of most weeds .
1	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	everything else seems pretty darn important .
1	6B	no i have n't talked about hospital additions . i mean i think that that -
0	6B	mm-mm .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	yeah . the additions probably can -
2	6B	hold off . i - would n't think that most hospitals are working at full capacity trunc full holding capacity right now , right ?
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	so the hospital additions , bagels -
0	6B	and eggs .
0	6B	and weed control . that 's four .
0	6B	mm .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	yes . totally
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	but that 's a u_s_d_a_ thing . push that off on the government .
2	6B	that 's not as local .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah . i think so .
0	6B	recreation and public services .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	yeah . definitely we 'd n-
2	6B	oh . i was thinking of housing assistance . cuz - you know - in my - my district we do n't have poor people .
2	6B	yeah . gone .
1	6B	gone .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	public access is more like the - that cable station .
0	6B	that anybody can go on and do - it 's what - it 's what we did before youtube .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	i think that 's - with youtube it 's pretty redundant .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	no . but i think - i think that public - yeah . i think that public news stations are important just because of the - of the -
0	6B	um .
2	6B	no . if we keep the stray cat spaying -
2	6B	then kitten and puppy adoption becomes a little less of a -
1	6B	issue . this is true
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	food banks are important to keep .
2	6B	eh . junior soccer league i 'm a big fan of . just because
0	6B	mm-yeah .
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	soup kitchen 's definitely to keep . housing assistance need to keep . but dog catcher - mm - yeah , i suppose .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	o-
2	6B	a public - a public veterinary hospital is just like no .
1	6B	no .
2	6B	priorities .
2	6B	humans above - pets any day .
0	6B	mm .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	mm .
0	6B	i do n't remember . football , -
1	6B	vet - veterinary veterinary hospital . yeah .
0	6B	what is it ? the -
0	6B	public access station . yes , three .
0	6B	mm-mm .
1	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	er .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	okay . they can go with that , totally .
0	6B	it 's four .
0	6B	no we did n't . um .
1	6B	i think that -
0	6B	that -
1	6B	you know - i dunno .
0	6B	it is -
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	yeah that seems like a logical one to cut .
2	6B	that could be really bad .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	yeah . i think we got our five .
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing .
0	6B	teaching trunc speed limit signs .
2	6B	nobody listens to them anyhow .
0	6B	boating license , pothole maintenance , subway , hunting tags , tunneling .
0	6B	massage certificates . flag pole repair ,
0	6B	taxis .
0	6B	bus upkeep , drainage ditches .
0	6B	er .
2	6B	well - flag pole repair bye .
2	6B	seemed like a no brainer .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	places where the taxis get to hang out .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	towing services . well i dunno . breakdowns on the highway that 's pretty important .
1	6B	yeah . that 's true .
1	6B	mm that 's all contracted out anyhow .
0	6B	like when d_o_t_ -
0	6B	flags someone for being - you know - parked for -
0	6B	they - it 's private .
2	6B	yeah . okay . that 's gone .
1	6B	that can go .
1	6B	yeah . i ca n't -
2	6B	that 'd be awesome .
1	6B	yeah . - yeah . let 's get rid of the speed limits .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	okay .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	i could go with that .
1	6B	yeah . especially since we 're -
1	6B	living in seattle . there 's not a whole lotta moose hunting going on - here .
0	6B	that 's four .
1	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	yeah . and we have n't really talked about em but taxi stops just do n't seem like they would make a whole lot of - sense . you know -
0	6B	one -
0	6B	taxis trunc are not listening to the laws to begin with then they 're being - you know - pushed out by uber and all these other folks . so -
0	6B	nn-yeah .
1	6B	yeah . i do n't think that 's so important . like boating licenses , that 's a source of income and -
1	6B	you know - tattoo artists i would certainly hope that they 're licensed .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	maybe -
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	drainage ditches . yeah , we live in high-rain area that 'd be bad if they did n't work right .
2	6B	additional bus stops i 'm always for .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah . i think that 's our five .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	and end scene .
0	6B	end scene .
2	6B	oh that 's right , we cut the drama coaches so -
1	6B	we ca n't .
