1	3I	i would put that - where was the , uh - ? yes , that 's fine . 
0	3I	mm . yep . 
1	3I	so much the same area , isn't it ? 
2	3I	i think it goes miscellaneous - that 's more miscellaneous kinda stuff . 
0	3I	trunc what kinda boots ? 
1	3I	let's put - start clothes up - way up there so - yeah . 
1	3I	hats do the same .

1	3I	where 'd we put the empty things ? 
1	3I	oh well . 
1	3I	hmm . so it's either here or here . 
1	3I	i think that 's either one . as well those are kinda miscellaneous things . 
0	3I	let's see . 
0	3I	uh - 
1	3I	down here . it's - it's a new kind of - 
1	3I	where's - where was that - ? oh , here . axes and things and - 
1	3I	let's - 
1	3I	continue that theme . 
1	3I	oh - we had something - yes . 
1	3I	travel and stuff . 
1	3I	yeah , that 's - that 's kind of miscellaneous again i - 
1	3I	is that a miscellaneous aisle ? 
1	3I	it goes with , uh - that 's refrigerated , isn't it ? 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	uh , i think book is - i think books is a section right up there . yeah . 
1	3I	it's - uh - the - um - 
1	3I	in here somewhere . 
0	3I	um - 
1	3I	oh yeah . are you gonna - ? 
1	3I	let's say it's - let's say it's coleman stoves , and it's gonna be for outdoor . 
0	3I	side - 
1	3I	in that section up there . 
2	3I	don't know . this was gonna be our building stuff . 
1	3I	um , so i 'll put it up on - i 'd put it up on top . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	uh , let's see . unless you see another place . 
1	3I	it could - it's could go in - 
1	3I	oh , there you go . let's - let's make it camping . yeah . okay . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	heavy cable . building stuff . yeah , that 's good . 
1	3I	uh , where was - where's our clothing ? 
1	3I	light jacket . okay . 
1	3I	oh , yeah . over there by the - the boat stuff . yeah . 
0	3I	okay . 
1	3I	we got a nice store . 
1	3I	people won't have trouble finding things in this one . 
2	6B	i think assistant cooks ought to be cut . 
1	6B	oh yeah . i - i - i think math tutors is - 
1	6B	worthwhile . 
1	6B	no . 
1	6B	we just have to . 
1	6B	we know there are cooks , and what you 're thinking is well cooks will have to work harder and they may not get all the food out . i remember now , you 're interested in food . that might not be - 
1	6B	one that you wanna cut . 
2	6B	that 's the one that i see there . 
1	6B	i - i like sex ed . i trunc i think that 's okay . 
2	6B	they - they 're necessary i think . unless - 
1	6B	mm-hmm . 
1	6B	i think so . 
2	6B	i think we need football equipment . 
0	6B	but i don't know what  acting coaches are . 
1	6B	that 's interesting , because you know what i was thinking about ? 
2	6B	but - i agree with you . i agree with you . no . no . i think you 're right . it's acting coaches as - let's interpret it as - 
1	6B	let's interpret it as you did . 
1	6B	yeah . yeah . yeah . 
1	6B	let's - i - i 'm happy with cutting that . 
1	6B	let's come back to that one . we 've got - we 've got - how many have we got ? we got two so far ? 
0	6B	okay . 
1	6B	we need those . yeah . i think that 's useful . 
1	6B	um . yes . 
2	6B	i think you have to have those . 
1	6B	and if you 're gonna have sugar few - sugar free - 
1	6B	those are gonna pay for themselves , actually . you don't have to worry about that . 
1	6B	we have to  buy them in the first place , but - 
1	6B	pretty soon they 're gonna pay for themselves . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	bookkeeping is useful , and music teachers are useful . 
2	6B	well , i think we could go to three . um - 
1	6B	oh ! because - 
1	6B	let's let the students be the assistant cooks . 
1	6B	and um - 
1	6B	and somebody from the cooking classes . 
1	6B	i think they do a bunch of stuff that - 
1	6B	like cleaning the toilets and all the - keeping the bathrooms clean , and all that kind of stuff that is necessary . 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	the acting coaches . 
1	6B	there was one more i think . 
0	6B	where was that one ? 
2	6B	i thought there was another one . 
1	6B	i thought we had three . bookkeeping , sugar free - 
0	6B	note taker - 
1	6B	oh ! that 's right . we were going back to it . that 's right . 
2	6B	oh no ! wait . trunc um - 
1	6B	acting coaches and assistant cooks were out , right ? 
1	6B	and we were worried - and i was - 
2	6B	let's leave em . 
2	6B	let's make only two cuts . 
1	6B	yeah . assistant cooks and - and um - acting coaches . 
1	6B	yeah . i 'm - i 'm gonna read through them just to see how - where we are . yeah . 
1	6B	i know ! 
1	6B	it's getting more difficult , isn't it ? 
1	6B	see . public health and safety gets to be a - a difficult one , doesn't it ? 
1	6B	mm-hmm . 
1	6B	hhh ! it's possible to leave - mean we got sex ed on the education . 
1	6B	trunc trunc and leave the other ? 
1	6B	to the , um - 
1	6B	um - hospitals and home . and home . yeah . 
1	6B	the - yeah , that would be - 
1	6B	you need the chicken pox . 
2	6B	either that , or - 
2	6B	you tell people that they have to have it out . you have to cut it out . 
1	6B	the only reason i 'm saying this - 
1	6B	is because those are the only two that i see that are even - are even - 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	mm-hmm . 
2	6B	what about weed control ? maybe - maybe those are the two that we can cut . 
2	6B	weed control trunc uh , since invasive species is going to be - 
2	6B	removed - 
2	6B	those aren't necessarily weeds , huh ? 
2	6B	and let everybody do their own weed control ? 
2	6B	oh trunc oh . oh ! the bottom one , neighborhood watch support ? 
2	6B	well , here's - the reason that - 
2	6B	i 'm - i 'm thinking about that , maybe a little bit differently , is because - 
2	6B	the neighborhood could - 
2	6B	organize themselves , and then you could put that over to another agency . 
2	6B	that 's to encourage people to get together and be vigilant . 
1	6B	but - 
1	6B	but - 
1	6B	if they wanted to know okay how , what should i do , buh buh buh , who do they go to . 
1	6B	than that - that would be - 
1	6B	that would be an issue . 
2	6B	trunc let's only consider the ones that - 
0	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	i think invasive species is more important to get rid of than the - 
2	6B	than - than just weeds . 
2	6B	um - but - 
2	6B	we also could consider neighborhood watch support . are you - ? 
2	6B	use - you - 
1	6B	i think weed control might be less important than neighborhood watch . 
1	6B	i 'm trunc i 'm discussing . 
0	6B	i don't know . 
1	6B	okay . issues . 
0	6B	okay . okay . 
2	6B	but if you were in a neighborhood where crime was rampant , you 'd also be - you 'd also be concerned about that . 
1	6B	okay . if you - 
1	6B	okay . 
0	6B	okay . 
1	6B	do the weed control . yeah . 
0	6B	hmm . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	well , there are some but - 
1	6B	i don't know how well - 
2	6B	well , maybe it's like - maybe it's like , um - 
2	6B	the - 
2	6B	amber alert things ? is that news ? or - ? or - ? 
2	6B	or traffic alerts , or - 
1	6B	that does . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	mm-hmm . 
0	6B	so - 
1	6B	mm-kay . question is news station and - ? 
1	6B	i think all those are useful - 
2	6B	they 're all useful . 
1	6B	let's - let's take the football stadium upkeep off and let them do their own . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	yeah , i think so . i can agree with that . 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing 
2	6B	why would you support - ? why would you support towing - ? 
1	6B	for - 
1	6B	for who ? 
1	6B	public ? 
2	6B	that 's not done by private companies ? 
0	6B	hmm . 
0	6B	what's a trunc what's a massage- ? what's a massage certificate ? 
0	6B	um - 
1	6B	okay . 
0	6B	certificate - certificate means you have to - 
0	6B	okay , you have to go through an exam to get it . 
1	6B	mm-kay what's - ? what do we not have to have on there ? 
2	6B	oh , but - but how about additional stops ? we don't need additional stops . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	oh , that 's for making a subway system though . isn't it ? 
1	6B	no . 
1	6B	okay , there you go . 
1	6B	okay , flagpole repair and - 
1	6B	we got two now , additional bus stops and flagpole repair . 
1	6B	i think all those are legit . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	so those are the only two that i can see that we agree on so far . 
0	6B	um - bus stops and flagpoles . 
0	6B	okay . 
1	6B	oh , we 've done it ? 
1	6B	we 're good !
