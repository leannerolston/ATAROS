1	3I	alright , so i 'm just gon na draw some of these at random .
0	3I	i 've got face cream .
1	3I	i think next to ice cream is the obvious - naw , no no no .
1	3I	probably near toilet paper , right ? alright .
1	3I	throw it on .
1	3I	i would probably maybe put that near sort-of , uh , the siding area ? like , it 's a home improvement -
1	3I	thing .
1	3I	uh yeah , i might put it across from siding .
1	3I	or down there . yeah , whatever .
0	3I	beets .
1	3I	food probably , maybe by soybeans . that seems sort of a producey -
2	3I	i would have a backpack near trunc but again also by toys , that 's tough .
1	3I	yeah , cuz you 're trunc , makes sense you 're backpacking .
0	3I	yeah .
0	3I	alright , i 've got sticks of butter .
2	3I	probably put that in between eggs and cake mix .
1	3I	yeah . do we have , uh - ? i guess we have boating supplies .
2	3I	maybe by mousetraps , though .
1	3I	sort of a thing you 'd keep around your house ?
2	3I	this is gon na be , like , a jumbly-ass store at some point .
0	3I	thick sweaters .
2	3I	we start a new clothes section , yeah , that 's what i was thinking .
1	3I	this is - i 'll put it , like , right there .
2	3I	that 's now our clothes section .
2	3I	well , i mean , like power cords is sort of a tool .
2	3I	we 're sort of having tools , like , we could do -
2	3I	but you might use a saw .
1	3I	yeah , okay . like , put it right - right in here ?
1	3I	alright , cool .
0	3I	canvas bags .
1	3I	i 'd probably put that near boating supplies .
1	3I	yeah , sure . yeah .
1	3I	i 've got some loose-leaf paper , i think that could go along with refrigerator magnets and books area .
1	3I	i 'd probably say down by power cords , tools-ish .
0	3I	heavy coats .
1	3I	could probably go right next to thick sweaters .
1	3I	yeah , maybe - like , we could have books of matches , small saws , bundles of sticks .
1	3I	i 've got half-inch tubing , that 's kind of a home improvement-y tool-ish thing .
1	3I	yeah , maybe , like , right in between here ?
1	3I	it can sort of - in this area .
1	3I	generally .
0	3I	i 've got wetsuits .
1	3I	i trunc i think boating supplies is the answer .
1	3I	yeah , it 's sort of , like - like , sort of camping travel .
2	3I	and usually in a grocery store , like , the bottled water 's in it 's own area .
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	uh , pre-cut wood ?
1	3I	i think .
2	3I	i 'm trunc i 'm thinking maybe near bundles of sticks .
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	yeah , sorta have it around tools-ish area .
0	3I	pouches of oatmeal -
2	3I	i think i 'd put near cake mix , it 's sort of a dry good .
2	3I	oh , but maybe also camping - well , it 's there now .
2	3I	yeah , i guess trunc it 's kinda , like , a trunc i think maybe , like , right here . it 's kinda , like , a home improvement thing . for your garden .
1	3I	think light jackets can probably go right by heavy coats .
1	3I	yeah .
2	3I	i 've got chocolate bars i think sort of near sugar and ice cream , i think this is , like , the sugary -
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	cans of peas ?
2	3I	i 'm thinking maybe by soybeans ?
1	3I	i 'm not really sure what pet food kinda goes with .
0	3I	like , what 's - at a grocery store , what is pet food usually with ?
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	yeah . junk food .
0	3I	i 've got fish hooks .
1	3I	think boating supplies .
1	3I	mm-hm .
0	3I	large vests .
2	3I	can continue to be in the clothes section .
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	egg timers ?
1	3I	i think maybe -
2	3I	trunc trunc egg timer 's not really for eggs , though . it 's , like , a cake - just like a - just a general kitchen timer .
1	3I	yeah , why not ?
1	3I	it 's not really a food , it 's sort of , like , a - mm , sort of pet food , kitchen items -
1	3I	area .
1	3I	or i guess , yeah , sorta general items .
1	3I	sure .
1	3I	shoelaces , i guess , is , uh clothing ?
1	3I	i would say so .
0	3I	fleece-lined boots .
0	3I	hm . gas-powered cookstoves ?
2	3I	that seems like a camping sorta thing , does n't it ?
1	3I	trunc put it up by backpacks ?
1	3I	tow ropes . probably with boating supplies .
1	3I	yeah .
2	3I	we might not be the best managers in the world - tell you the truth .
1	3I	mm .
1	3I	think , uh paper bags , along with , like , pet food and egg timers ?
1	3I	really anywhere in this column , it could go .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	you would use duct tape maybe if your stove breaks down .
0	3I	fishing net .
2	3I	gon na sorta wedge that in there probably shoulda gone closer to the boat .
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	i 've got large cups . i think along with paper bags ?
2	3I	yeah . i 'm gon na put package of cookies up here between chocolate bars and ice cream .
2	3I	i mean , i 'd put it , like , right here , fishing net . you might use some weights for your fishing trip .
2	3I	this is sorta just your outdoorsy area .
1	3I	i might also put over there .
1	3I	well where - where - where trunc you think about empty trunc like , it 's an empty jug .
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	by the - yeah . sorta there , toiletries-ish .
1	3I	or up there , yeah .
0	3I	tweezers .
1	3I	i trunc put -
1	3I	right there . and , uh , that 's it !
2	3I	that 's our store ! there 's not a lot of food in our store .
1	3I	yeah , i mean -
1	6B	so let 's start with educations and programs .
2	6B	well -
2	6B	those are both good things .
2	6B	maybe . i mean , i think - bookkeeping classes , you know , that 's important . that 's basically accounting , that 's - teaching people how to manage their money , that 's good for the community .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	yeah , those could probably go .
1	6B	i mean -
2	6B	our kids are gon na be fat no matter what .
1	6B	alright , what , uh - let 's see , i think we hafta -
0	6B	how many have we cut so far ?
1	6B	cut sugar-free . alright .
1	6B	uh , maybe trunc we could cut acting coaches ?
1	6B	that seems like something that people could do privately .
1	6B	yeah , an-
1	6B	see , poetry books could probably also go .
1	6B	okay , i mean , yeah , i -
1	6B	assistant cooks .
1	6B	i think that could probably go .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	i would say keep math tutors .
2	6B	definitely keep sex ed .
1	6B	keep custodians , speech therapy .
1	6B	uh , special ed teachers , definitely keep .
1	6B	notetakers , keep .
1	6B	i would say keep music teachers , you know . art 's important .
0	6B	so we - trunc what 's , uh - cut , uh , sugar-free juice machines -
0	6B	assistant cooks .
0	6B	and acting coaches .
1	6B	alright , three things . we can do this .
2	6B	i trunc it 's the same as sex ed , is n't it ?
2	6B	but it ca n't hurt to have two , honestly .
2	6B	oh , okay , this is for adults .
1	6B	yeah , okay . fair enough , fair enough .
2	6B	job training programs we should definitely keep . chicken pox vaccinations we should probably keep .
2	6B	yeah . we should definitely keep toxic waste disposal .
1	6B	uh , hospital additions ?
2	6B	well , trunc let 's trunc let 's come back to that one . i think we can get rid of the bagel factory inspections .
2	6B	just cuz -
2	6B	if it was , like , factory inspections in general , we should keep that , but specific to bagel factories seems like a weird targeted , almost anti-'semitic -
2	6B	government thing to be funding .
2	6B	just . there 's more food than bagels .
2	6B	uh , i would say keep needle exchange .
2	6B	uh , trunc keep the sex offender database .
1	6B	keep veterans medical assistance .
2	6B	yeah . like , say , we 're trunc we 're dumping bagel factory inspections and weed control .
1	6B	uh , egg farms regulations ?
2	6B	i do n't know what those are , but , i mean , it probably would n't hurt to keep them .
2	6B	that 's people 's food .
1	6B	i would say yeah , keep that . it 's a public health -
2	6B	i would get rid of neighborhood watch support .
2	6B	presumably you already have police .
2	6B	yeah , but neighborhood watch support i feel a lot of time is just people spying on their neighbors .
1	6B	okay , so is that three ?
0	6B	alright.1+
0	6B	recreation , public services .
1	6B	let 's just do a quick scan , see if anything can just go from , like the get go .
1	6B	i like most of these . um -
2	6B	i - i - i - i would be with you on the football stadium upkeep , just cuz it already exists , but i would n't wan na cut the sports clubs .
1	6B	i think maybe kitty trunc kitten and puppy adoption could be trunc done by a private charity .
1	6B	does n't necessarily need to be run by the city .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	definitely keep housing assistance and soup kitchens and food banks .
2	6B	so if we have a public news station , i 'm not sure if we need a public access station ?
2	6B	well -
2	6B	i 'm for that , personally but that 's cuz i used to live in seoul , that has a huge stray cat problem .
2	6B	and i 'm very much in favor of getting rid of , like , more stray cats .
2	6B	i do n't want them to keep making more .
2	6B	like , those things are loud .
2	6B	and they 're gross .
1	6B	alright , so trunc trunc so we got football stadium upkeep -
1	6B	uh , kitten and puppy adoption .
2	6B	trunc trunc my vote is public access if we already have public news . i 've seen the public access channel . it 's a lot of weird stuff that is not particularly helpful .
2	6B	i do n't remember the number , but it 's just , like , a bunch of people can get on , have their own shows . there 's one guy who 's been running a kurt cobain was murdered show for like ten years now and it 's - it 's funny , but it 's not -
2	6B	if it was keep that or keep p_b_s_ , i 'm keeping p_b_s_ every single time .
1	6B	alright , so -
0	6B	uh , i 've heard of it , but i 've never actually seen it .
0	6B	it 's , like , our local s_n_l_ sketch comedy sort of trunc thing ?
2	6B	it 's not hard to do .
2	6B	okay , it was trunc it was hard to do , then . back then it was good .
0	6B	have n't heard of it .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	no , but i - i know who she is . um she comes to some of the stuff at meany hall .
0	6B	to do reviews of it , i guess .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	i 've never seen her , just know the name . i mean , maybe i have . i would n't know .
0	6B	alright , so .
0	6B	yeah , infrastructure licensing , um -
1	6B	yeah . um -
1	6B	maybe flagpole repair ?
1	6B	we could cut some space there .
1	6B	they seem pretty tough .
1	6B	yeah , i mean i guess you trunc you can - these days , you just call a taxi .
2	6B	naw , i would keep - i mean , if you 've ever been to spokane , you wan na know about keeping pothole maintenance .
2	6B	they trunc they got rid of that and it 's a nightmare .
1	6B	maybe trunc yeah , i was gon na say that , or more , tattoo artist licenses .
1	6B	yeah , i guess they should be licensed .
1	6B	and not just random folks .
2	6B	i 'd say if you 're having an unlicensed masseuse , it 's less dangerous that 's a good point .
1	6B	alright , yeah . so i say we cut massage , uh , flagpole , and taxi stops all there right in a row .
0	6B	alright , cool !
1	6B	budget solved .
