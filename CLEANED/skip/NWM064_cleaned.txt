2	3I	nah.
2	3I	trunc trunc and besides, f-
1	3I	yeah, and trunc and food, trunc any case - trunc i think we assume the people have running water.

0	3I	box knives.
1	3I	small axes, small saws? box knives.
1	3I	food.

0	3I	scissors.
1	3I	mm-hm.
1	3I	alright!

2	6B	well, i mean - i don't want - trunc trunc
1	6B	maybe we trunc we should remove the football equipment?

0	6B	mm-hm. assistant cooks.
0	6B	and acting coaches.
1	6B	mm-hm.
1	6B	now for public health and safety.
1	6B	we should probably keep reproductive education.
2	6B	well, * yes, but this is, i suppose -
2	6B	yeah, and then sex ed is for - i think is for high school. this is - yeah.
2	6B	we should definitely keep that.
1	6B	trunc keep.
1	6B	invasive species removal we should also keep.
2	6B	s_t_d_ education, also keep.
1	6B	yep.
0	6B	hm.

1	6B	let's see -
1	6B	hm. football stadium upkeep.
2	6B	well, i mean - uh, this is basically - this is mostly based on my own personal biases, but i'd say football stadium upkeep -
2	6B	junior soccer league -
2	6B	and boy's basketball club.
2	6B	trunc i suppose. i mean - they'll probably take out their - their trunc vengeance trunc on some s-
2	6B	on some - on someone else if they trunc
2	6B	if do that.
1	6B	uh, how bout -
1	6B	alright, i suppose.
2	6B	yeah, yeah yeah.
2	6B	and keep pest control and public access station and public news trunc station.

2	6B	we should definitely keep that.
1	6B	trunc keep.
1	6B	invasive species removal we should also keep.
2	6B	s_t_d_ education, also keep.
1	6B	yep.
0	6B	hm.

2	6B	junior soccer league -
2	6B	and boy's basketball club.
2	6B	trunc i suppose. i mean - they'll probably take out their - their trunc vengeance trunc on some s-
2	6B	on some - on someone else if they trunc
2	6B	if do that.
1	6B	uh, how bout -
1	6B	alright, i suppose.

0	6B	trunc now the person trunc who -
2	6B	person - the people who run it are now running this new show, the two oh six. not, trunc nearly as good, i'd say.

2	6B	you're cutting something into somebody's * skin.
0	6B	uh -
