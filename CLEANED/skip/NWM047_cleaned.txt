0	3I	okay .
0	3I	well , if they mean a - like a boating supply thing .
2	3I	that might be the best place to go . but it looks what they 've - they want us to do here are put the , um , food -
1	3I	on the right . and then in the middle , like domestic supplies .
1	3I	and then on the left , like , more kind of , man stuff .
1	3I	or - i probably should n't say that , but - trunc in quotes , you know .
0	3I	oh .
0	3I	actually , our professional organization is having a conference in portland next week .
0	3I	yeah , the tesol conference is in portland this year .
0	3I	but i 'm not going .
0	3I	mm . mm-hm .
0	3I	yeah . yeah .
0	3I	ah , kay . okay . okay .
0	3I	being slightly sarcastic again . i -
0	3I	but plenty of whiskey , right ?
0	3I	oh , okay , yeah . that 's what portland 's more famous for , right ? yeah .
0	3I	hm .
0	3I	that was n't the one that got in trouble down in south america , was it ?
0	3I	okay . you know about that , right ?
0	3I	okay , yeah , that was a different -
0	3I	oh , maybe it was obama , yeah .
0	3I	i ca n't remember .
0	3I	yeah , yeah .
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	well , yeah .
0	3I	yeah , right , exactly .
1	3I	boating supplies , yeah . that 's pretty -
2	3I	i spose what we can do is we can go through everything , and we can just put the obvious stuff . quote unquote .
2	3I	uh , and then go back - kinda like flash cards . where you do n't something , you just go straight - put it back .
1	3I	bottles of juice ? that 's obviously a -
1	3I	food . probably a drink , right ?
2	3I	but unfortunately , they did n't make drinks clear .
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	bottles of juice are trunc they 've got sugar in it . most - most juice has sugar now , right ?
1	3I	that 's a domestic supply , right ?
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	i guess it does n't matter if - either one , huh ?
0	3I	uh .
0	3I	bags .
0	3I	okay .
1	3I	scissors . i spose we can move em around , right ? they 're not like -
1	3I	set in stone .
1	3I	yeah , that 'd make sense .
2	3I	fishing net . that 's obviously -
2	3I	kind of a boating supply thing . involves a boat . fish hooks too .
1	3I	uh , socks is clothes .
2	3I	uh yeah , they did n't really give us a clothes thing , did they ? that could be our - our weak link , here , because it 's like -
2	3I	um , they 're forcing us to put it in a weird place , if we do n't leave space for it . like , it does n't really go next to soy beans , does it ?
1	3I	unless it would be a -
1	3I	yeah . yeah , maybe we could - assuming that we do n't have too many clothes , right ?
1	3I	just kinda , do this ?
1	3I	for now ?
1	3I	mm-kay .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	and that would also trunc i assume that these are like , walls here . so if they were walking up here , then they could either have the trunc refrigerator magnets or the bottles of juice . or i mean , the egg timers , and - well , if they had eggs , it would go there , right ?
1	3I	matches . probably here , with the -
0	3I	oh yeah ?
0	3I	oh .
0	3I	huh . maybe we should -
0	3I	ask . uh .
1	3I	mm-kay .
1	3I	uh . let 's put that at the end . just in trunc unless -
1	3I	i mean , it would be a domestic supply , right ?
1	3I	could - but it could theoretically go either with sports equipment or - if that 's how we 're gon na organize it . or with domestic stuff .
2	3I	well , let 's just put it here , just in case .
1	3I	uh , yeah . well , let 's put it at the end , and then we can figure it out later . and we 'll remember it .
0	3I	mm .
1	3I	okay . so , food .
1	3I	and that 's kinda like soy beans and peas , right ? there . legumes .
0	3I	figs .
1	3I	again , somewhere along there .
1	3I	oh , the weird thing though , is this is fixed , right ?
1	3I	um . hm . so i should prolly move that , huh ?
2	3I	well , otherwise -
2	3I	it would n't make sense to have eggs timers anywhere . besides the eggs .
1	3I	unless here -
1	3I	mouse - it sort of goes with clocks . okay . yeah , right .
1	3I	it 's got ta be a domestic thing .
1	3I	okay . we might have another fishy thing there .
0	3I	knives .
1	3I	well that could theoretically be either -
1	3I	you wan na keep that with your - mm .
1	3I	paper is a domestic supply .
0	3I	that 's paper bags .
1	3I	okay .
0	3I	um .
1	3I	i wonder if they have kitty litter . that 'll be really funny .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	yeah . trunc yeah . things to drink . drinkable -
0	3I	things . um .
1	3I	uh . yeah , if they did have kitty litter , that would go next to the pet food , right ?
1	3I	with liters of water ? oh yeah , yeah . that would make sense . mm .
0	3I	small axes ? or is it axes ?
0	3I	i know , i 'm just , uh , making little linguistic jokes , here . um .
1	3I	well , that 's got ta go with our uh , outdoor stuff .
1	3I	but - yeah .
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	yeah , cuz we could have like , another electronic item here , with power cords . like , could be batteries or a generator . so let 's see if they have that .
0	3I	yeah , and then these are deck chairs . cushions .
1	3I	mm . just for now .
0	3I	butter
1	3I	yeah . kay .
1	3I	soap . toothpaste ?
0	3I	backpacks .
1	3I	yeah . we 'll stick it there for now . can move it down .
0	3I	yeah .
2	3I	yeah , it 's gon na be weird . well maybe - actually -
0	3I	i wonder if there was some other , uh -
0	3I	but then you 'd have like , books and boating supplies and -
0	3I	boot straps , i guess , next to -
0	3I	and i did work in a fred trunc actually , i worked at - do you know where stadium fred meyer is ?
0	3I	i worked there ! that was one of my first jobs . in nineteen eighty-nine .
0	3I	yeah , summer of nineteen eighty-nine , i was back from my -
0	3I	second year at u_w_ or something like that .
0	3I	and i got a job trunc in the - trunc eve 's buffet .
0	3I	of trunc burlingame fred meyer 's . i worked there for one summer .
0	3I	one of my first jobs .
0	3I	mm-hm . mm-hm .
0	3I	ah , yeah . yeah , yeah . uh-huh . yeah , that 's the one that went right by - yeah , fifty-one . i useta take fifty-one all the time . over the hill .
0	3I	yeah .
0	3I	yeah . yeah , yeah , django 's . i - i useta go there .
0	3I	hm .
0	3I	hm . mm-hm , mm-hm .
1	3I	yeah , i useta go into django 's too . they had some good - good stuff . in the early nineties , especially .
1	3I	oh , right , yeah . i was more like , in the grunge times . yeah . they had some good grunge stuff .
0	3I	yeah .
0	3I	uh-huh .
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	yeah , it 's gon na hafta be , is n't it ?
0	3I	hm . well . books .
2	3I	but trunc if it 's like this at all , the thing we already did , they - they 're not gon na have a lotta things that are related to books . yeah . it 's got ta go - got ta go there .
1	3I	uh , cups ? that 's got ta go with the buckets , right ? maybe ?
1	3I	yeah . empty plastic jugs .
1	3I	yeah , yeah . mm-kay .
1	3I	uh , cookies ! oh , with the cakes ? maybe .
0	3I	oatmeal .
1	3I	yeah . yeah .
0	3I	tubing .
1	3I	by the duct tape ? or power cords ? either one ?
1	3I	no if there 's space in there but -
0	3I	i wonder if they 're recording - or if they 're measuring our - what - what we consider humorous .
2	3I	i imagine it would be totally different for other people , you know .
1	3I	actually , i really do n't like whiskey that much , but my dad likes whiskey a lot . he 's a - he 's a big jameson fan .
0	3I	and every christmas , we 'll go over to murphy 's here , or some other - murphy 's cuz it 's open on christmas , right ?
0	3I	it 's the only place that 's open on christmas , that i know of .
0	3I	and so we 'll get , like , an irish coffee or something like that . and jameson whiskey , and he really likes that , so . it 's kind of a little family treat .
2	3I	got ta go next to the package of cookies . or the ice cream .
1	3I	mm-hm . mm-hm .
1	3I	okay .
2	3I	yeah , that 's a be good one to hang on and - or you could just take it home , you know ?
0	3I	um .
1	3I	tweezers . put it on your refrigerator .
1	3I	yeah . right . it 's like , we get to take at least one home , right ?
0	3I	um .
2	3I	yeah , toiletry-kinda stuff .
0	3I	uh , canvas bags . not bigs , but bags .
1	3I	it 's got ta go near the -
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	for now , at least . .
1	3I	wood . it 's gon na be probably up in here .
1	3I	or you want it by axes ? and maybe the knives .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	kay .
0	3I	face cream .
1	3I	toiletries here ?
1	3I	kay .
0	3I	i wonder how many toothpastes we 're gon na get .
0	3I	mint . is there gon na be cinnamon and spearmint or -
0	3I	peppermint ? okay . that 's the only kind ?
0	3I	uh .
1	3I	right ? i think so , yeah . i think so .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	that 's gon na hafta move around a little .
0	3I	kay .
0	3I	um .
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	yeah . that 'd make sense .
0	3I	five-pound weights .
0	3I	oh , maybe . it might be a fishing thing .
2	3I	but that 'd be a - well whale . you catching whales .
1	3I	i do n't think even the -
1	3I	fishermen use five-pound weights for their whaling . with the neah bay -
0	3I	uh , who are they ? the tribe ?
0	3I	maybe a five-pound harpoon .
0	3I	oh , it could be a scuba diving thing .
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	yeah , yeah , that would be a lot for - you would n't put that much on your belt .
1	3I	yeah , yeah . unless it 's like for a crab pot . but you would n't - well , i dunno , whatever . we 'll figure it out later .
0	3I	gas-powered trunc stove .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	sweater ? light jacket ?
0	3I	boots ?
1	3I	i think . i hope . we do n't destroy it but - . okay .
1	3I	peat moss . um . gardening things .
2	3I	well , that was kind of an outlier , right ? i mean , we 're getting close to the end , so we prolly wo n't have that many more gardening things . right ?
2	3I	so that 's probably good enough . i mean , we 'll have those kind of like , miscellaneous - semi-miscellaneous -
1	3I	electric heaters . those have got ta go next to the power cords , right ?
2	3I	uh , small saws . but that should go by the axes .
2	3I	the cups could go by the liters of water . because if that was like a party supply - it would n't matter . it could go either way .
1	3I	and if we need the space , it could be -
1	3I	put the saws by the axes , and then the cut wood ?
1	3I	kay .
1	3I	oh , yeah .
0	3I	yeah .
0	3I	jugs and cups .
1	3I	yeah , that 'll make sense .
0	3I	and chocolate .
1	3I	by the cakes ? or the ice cream ?
1	3I	and the sugar . and of course , doughnuts .
0	3I	and this is - this moves , right ? yeah .
0	3I	okay .
0	3I	coats .
1	3I	by the thick sweaters .
0	3I	bagels ? not - do you say bagels or baggles ?
0	3I	trunc but you say bag . canvas bag . but you say bagels .
0	3I	actually i do too . so , that 's the same , i think .
0	3I	bagels and bags .
1	3I	um . p. somewhere in here ? or doughnuts ? doughnuts and bagels are kind of alike , are n't they ?
1	3I	doughnuts without sugar ?
0	3I	um . yeah , the outlier .
1	3I	kay .
1	3I	yeah . cuz we 're not gon na have other book stuff , right ? we 're almost at the end .
2	3I	hats . would be with the coats , and - ?
1	3I	or here ?
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	how bout that , then ?
1	3I	and - bundles of sticks are gon na need to go here , right ?
1	3I	and shoelaces ? those have got ta by - go by the boots , right ?
1	3I	okay .
0	3I	yeah . and then we 're done .
1	3I	alright , that 's it .
2	3I	that 's got ta be cut .
1	3I	yeah . yeah , that 's like a building thing , right ? like a a costco building supply section .
1	3I	yeah , that 's a domestic thing . or , it could even go with the uh -
1	3I	well , any of the domestic stuff . yeah .
1	3I	yeah , yeah . that would make sense . matches with the camping . kinda like camping gear , here .
1	3I	yeah , and this is all domestic stuff , like in your pantry , or whatever .
0	3I	okay .
1	3I	looks good .
1	3I	yeah , it 's a bit of an outlier .
1	3I	the only other problem we really have is just -
1	3I	yeah , just to make it -
1	3I	together . um .
0	3I	uh .
1	3I	let 's see . i wonder if the knives could go next to the axes .
1	3I	and then we could kinda move this down and move the cable next to the power cords .
2	3I	oh . that 's right . oh , what a pain . well , okay .
1	3I	uh , are there any of the others that we could move around ?
1	3I	oh , okay .
1	3I	trunc uh yeah . if they 're like , right across from each other then ? okay .
1	3I	yeah , the only , um , serious thing i see is just these gaps . but those are kind of pre-ordained by the things that are forced on us .
0	3I	yeah .
0	3I	was this the one that was definite ?
0	3I	or is this a movable one ?
0	3I	oh yeah , okay . so , um -
1	3I	we could possibly -
2	3I	i - i like that . but um .
2	3I	i could understand if you would wan na move it .
2	3I	i just think it 's really funny . oh , the only thing is , though , that uh -
0	3I	well see - which one was the one that was stuck permanently ?
0	3I	was there one of these that was stuck trunc ?
0	3I	oh , okay .
1	3I	okay , and then these . yeah . cuz it seems like these would go together with that . but i guess one - one of these is firm , and one of these is - that 's firm , right ?
2	3I	yeah . theoretically , that would be a good idea , but that 's not what they wan na let us do . so -
2	3I	screw it .
1	3I	as they say in business . okay .
0	3I	alright .
1	3I	yeah , well done .
2	3I	wonder if we earned our coffee now . now that 's the thing they do n't have . they do n't have coffee ! what the hell ?
0	6B	so , basically , cut or continue funding .
1	6B	that 's kinda like being in the government .
1	6B	uh , the uh , budget subcommittee , or whatever .
0	6B	senate budget subcommittee .
0	6B	ca n't remember who sits on that now .
0	6B	um .
0	6B	well , does it say how much we 're trunc how many we 're sposta take out ? or we just - ?
0	6B	oh .
1	6B	so we 'd like , take two outta here and two outta here and two outta here and two outta here , or something like that ?
2	6B	well , math tutors , i mean , we do n't need math tutors . uh . if kids ca n't add , then they 're just hopeless .
2	6B	i mean , they need to , you know . what -
2	6B	all they need to do is buy a text book . and uh if they ca n't -
2	6B	you know , pay attention in class , and do their homework , and read the text book , then it 's like -
2	6B	they should just become english majors .
2	6B	well , i think they should try it for a while , but then if it -
2	6B	if they just flunking out , it 's like , switch to sociology or something .
1	6B	mm-kay .
1	6B	seems like a w-
2	6B	seems like a waste of time , but alright .
2	6B	oh , we hafta have that . because -
2	6B	well , because -
1	6B	because if we 're -
1	6B	hiking through the wilderness in canada , and we 've got twenty miles to go to the next -
1	6B	town , we 're gon na need somebody to cook for us , right ?
1	6B	oh , yeah , okay .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	plus you 'd probably disagree with them after a while anyway . it 'd be like , you know , it 's like , hey , i do n't like the way you made this . i just wan na make it myself .
2	6B	cuz nobody can really -
2	6B	yeah , yeah . it could get dangerous after a while .
2	6B	well , that 's beyond question , right ?
2	6B	well that never stops , right ? your whole life , right ? i mean , you -
1	6B	need that when you 're in -
1	6B	you need that even more when you 're in your seventies .
1	6B	okay .
0	6B	um , let 's see . custodians ?
2	6B	uh , well , i mean , you know . depends on whether or not it 's a union shop .
2	6B	cuz you gon na hafta deal with the -
2	6B	um , the stewards .
2	6B	mm they got a pretty powerful lobby . well ,
2	6B	it trunc what it really comes down to is whether or not this is teamsters .
1	6B	well , yeah .
1	6B	yeah yeah yeah . yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	right , yeah , yeah . that 's pretty -
2	6B	i 've seen the classrooms here . believe me .
1	6B	we 'll hafta come back to that one .
1	6B	yeah , good question . they do n't specify .
2	6B	yeah , something could be done with making these a little bit more specific .
2	6B	less ambiguous anyway .
0	6B	education ? um , well , okay , so ,
0	6B	we 're gon na -
0	6B	um -
1	6B	so , this assumes that we already have a bunch of football equipment , and we 're gon na throw it away ?
1	6B	and buy new trunc buy new equipment ?
1	6B	or is this a committee to oversee the football equipment ?
0	6B	mm .
2	6B	well , see , this is -
2	6B	this is a county .
2	6B	so that stuff 's probably all moldy and -
2	6B	from the seventies , you know ?
2	6B	it 's just gross ! throw it away !
2	6B	yeah , i am saying that .
0	6B	cuz i 've -
1	6B	i 've used it in um -
1	6B	i , uh , i actually worked for uh , multnomah county for awhile . i worked for the uh -
1	6B	well , it was for the libraries . multnomah county library . at the hillsdale library !
1	6B	i worked at the hillsdale library for three months .
0	6B	one year .
0	6B	it was one , one summer .
0	6B	and , eh - well -
0	6B	now ,
1	6B	i - i did n't actually play football , but i mean , i did like p_e_ , of course . at - you know , in school . and - and that stuff - man , that - that -
2	6B	it 's so - you - you do n't wan na - it 's so rank .
2	6B	you do n't wan na put that stuff on -
0	6B	not the football equipment . but i 'm talking about the high school now .
0	6B	no , the high school - this was all multnomah county stuff , right ?
0	6B	and it said -
0	6B	so when you got one of those -
0	6B	i 'm talking about more like baseball . cuz i played baseball , right ?
1	6B	inside the baseball helmets ,
2	6B	you know ? it 'd say multnomah county . it was like , oh man , you would n't even wan na put that thing on ! it was so gross . it was all -
2	6B	they never - well , of course that would be an argument for changing it . but -
2	6B	i dunno . i - i - they could probably cut all that stuff .
2	6B	why - ? trunc it - it should n't be football equipment , it should be sports equipment . if it was sports equipment , i would say , yes , keep it .
2	6B	but it 's just football equipment ?
1	6B	i mean , you know , not everybody plays football . so -
0	6B	of course ,
1	6B	that could bring in big bucks for the - the county , you know . cuz they got these football teams . they got these like , big football stars , and whatever . and they end up going to the n_f_l_ . and they get all these contracts and stuff .
0	6B	so -
0	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	yeah . so maybe we should keep it . we should keep it .
1	6B	okay . i 'm with you .
0	6B	acting coaches .
0	6B	well you mean -
0	6B	the - the acting coaches , like , not the retired ones ?
0	6B	like , if you think about the football coach ,
0	6B	he 's already -
0	6B	retired .
1	6B	and these are the actual acting coaches . you would n't wan na get rid of them .
1	6B	exactly . yeah yeah , right , yeah .
1	6B	yeah , like the sandusky guy , or whatever , you know .
2	6B	could get rid of the retired coaches .
1	6B	you know , honestly , i was not a -
1	6B	big into poetry .
0	6B	so .
1	6B	but i - i should n't use that as a basis to - i -
1	6B	i 'm not supposed to be biased , right ?
0	6B	so .
2	6B	i 'll leave that up to you .
0	6B	e_ -
1	6B	e_e_ cummings ? okay . robert frost ? okay . everybody else , forget it .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	oh yeah , you got ta keep them .
2	6B	yeah , cuz -
2	6B	you know , with our society , we 're just gon na need more and more of those , as time goes on , i think .
2	6B	cuz they 're creating new categories of special ed all the time .
2	6B	they 're subdividing now .
2	6B	it 's - it 's a high need .
0	6B	in fact -
2	6B	hey , here 's the thing . it 's funny because when i - i did my um , my tesol degree , my - my m_a_ in tesol here .
1	6B	and uh , i ended up taking a course in how to teach writing to - well , they call it learning disabled now . l_d_s .
2	6B	but it 's basically special ed .
2	6B	and um , well trunc i mean , there is a difference .
0	6B	but um - and -
1	6B	and they were saying that , you know , with all the teachers that were being uh -
1	6B	losing their jobs , and whatever .
1	6B	that was the category that everybody was trying to become . because that 's where the jobs are .
2	6B	so that 's like , it 's booming business .
2	6B	yeah . that 's a huge business now . that 's a big business .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	well , it 's either that or starve to death , right ? i mean , geez .
2	6B	yeah , that 's true . i - i never took a cooking class , and i 'm still alive , you know ?
1	6B	just barely .
1	6B	but still .
2	6B	well , some people gon na need em .
2	6B	and the thing is , they - they have crossover with like , second-language learners , too .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	well , actually , at this point now -
1	6B	at this point , that 's pretty much what it 's gon na be , right ?
2	6B	so then it should be under a different category . it should be under like , uh -
1	6B	i was gon na say technology .
1	6B	i_t_ .
1	6B	because they 're the ones that 're actually gon na issue the devices , right ?
1	6B	just gon na stick a computer in your hand and say , here , punch this button , click this .
1	6B	it 's not gon na be any need for a person .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .

2	6B	they need to , um -
2	6B	what they should have in - in a school , like in the -
2	6B	they should have the high school kids go out and do like ,
2	6B	you know , one -
2	6B	they get one credit for community service , right ?
2	6B	go out , and - well , yeah . so they 've got them to do it . they do n't need to have -
2	6B	yeah , they do n't need to have that funded , for special people to do that .
1	6B	neighborhood watch . well , i dunno . how dangerous of a place is this ?
1	6B	trunc like inner-city chicago or something ?
1	6B	well , there 's another ambiguity .
0	6B	just trunc trunc you know , trunc sell - trunc
2	6B	is n't there like a g_i_ joe where they can buy weapons and stuff ?
1	6B	or like in the south park episode where cartman runs around with his pepper spray after he becomes the hall monitor .
0	6B	well , they trunc trunc okay , so they make him a hall monitor .
0	6B	right ?
0	6B	trunc pretty simple .
0	6B	and - and then he gets this thing in his head . he 's like , alright , i 'm gon na just pepper spray everyone .
0	6B	and he gets this pepper spray , and he 's like ,
0	6B	he 's like , where 's your hall pass ? and the guy does n't take it out fast enough .
1	6B	there you go .
1	6B	yeah , you just need trunc
0	6B	but i mean , that was -
0	6B	he was -
1	6B	just a student , right ?
1	6B	he was given that responsibility , that was just a natural thing . i mean he was n't paid for that . that 's not something you hafta pay for .
1	6B	yeah . if you 're -
1	6B	tire irons . ball peen hammers .
1	6B	chains and whips ?
1	6B	yeah . well .
1	6B	i think they g-
2	6B	nah , they 're gon na -
2	6B	it 's gon na be -
2	6B	wherever they happen to feel like it .
2	6B	they 're just gon na dump it anywhere .
2	6B	well ,
2	6B	yeah . but still .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	i just toss it in the street .
2	6B	i mean , there 's a drain , right ?
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	well , i strain it first , but yeah .
1	6B	that 's where i toss my needles , too .
0	6B	do you have any cats ?

0	6B	ah .
2	6B	i do n't think they paid for anything , right ? they just fly around on lear jets .
2	6B	oh my god . gim me a break . there 's - you do n't even need - i mean there 's like , millions of em , right ?
2	6B	so , why would you need a - ?
2	6B	i guess you need to have a place to keep them , in order to provide them for adoption
2	6B	but most people just kinda pass em around , do n't they ?
1	6B	is n't that how you got your cat and dog ?
1	6B	you just got em from your neighbors ?
0	6B	oh really ?
2	6B	was that useful to you ?
2	6B	but i mean , if they -
2	6B	if they had not had that ,
2	6B	would n't you 've just been able to like , you know , go up to your neighbors and just say , hey , you got any little puppies in there ?
1	6B	would that 've been a trunc major problem , if you had n't had an adoption service like that , to - to get your
1	6B	kitten and puppies from ?
1	6B	and that made it easier for you ?
2	6B	okay , well , we 'll keep it then .
1	6B	just going to the park , and go
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	okay , we 'll keep that .
2	6B	trunc well , food bank and soup kitchens go together , and we hafta have those .
2	6B	cuz otherwise , you know , people gon na starve on the street .
2	6B	well , we 've trunc we still got that case of whiskey , right ?
2	6B	and the bagels . and the cookies , and the toothpaste .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	there 's a whiskey a go go .
1	6B	we do n't need a dog catcher .
2	6B	cuz we 've got the community service , with the baseball bats and -
1	6B	and the - and the pepper spray , right ?
2	6B	the neighborhood watch . the pepper spray .
3	6B	oh , i - we can -
2	6B	we can combine them .
2	6B	trunc why do they hafta be different ? it should be the same people .
1	6B	there you go . two for one , right ?
2	6B	just make em work overtime .
2	6B	i mean , those people -
2	6B	they just - what do they do most of the time ? they just around and like , eat doughnuts in a room or something , right ? i mean , they 're not working all the time .
2	6B	the people who work
2	6B	in both places .
1	6B	the , um , the spaying ,
1	6B	the kitty and puppy adoption ,
1	6B	and the , um , and the dog catcher .
2	6B	they 're just spending most of their time sitting around , reading -
2	6B	magazines and stuff , right ? i mean , they can just -
2	6B	instead of - it 's like ,
2	6B	okay , instead of having this down time ,
2	6B	just go and catch some dogs .
1	6B	when you 're not -
1	6B	you know , facilitating the adoption of a puppy .
1	6B	right . yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	well , i mean , they just rotate it , right ?
1	6B	it 's like , okay , so you 'll catch dogs while i -
1	6B	uh , facilitate the adoption of puppies .
1	6B	and trunc yeah .
2	6B	well , i mean , sp-
2	6B	how long does it take to spay ?
1	6B	it 's like five minutes , right ? it 's like
0	6B	you know .
0	6B	i mean -
2	6B	how long can it take to spay ?
1	6B	well , yeah , of course . yeah .
2	6B	well , newspaper would work better for that , prolly .
2	6B	uh , well , i mean , people already know about that , though , right ? we do n't need to campaign for it .
2	6B	people already know that they 're sposta bring their bags in - a bag with them in to -
2	6B	yeah , we would n't - we would n't need a special campaign for that .
0	6B	i mean , it 's just -
2	6B	well , you could bring a politician with you , and he - use his bag .
2	6B	you mean like a bag of wind .
1	6B	well , if we have the kitten and puppy adoption , then we hafta have veterinary hospital , right ?
2	6B	cuz they 're gon na get sick , and then there 's gon na be lawsuits .
0	6B	hm .
0	6B	today ?
0	6B	mm .
0	6B	oh .
0	6B	mm .
2	6B	unless for the stray dogs .
2	6B	or the stray cats .
2	6B	the stray cats need to be -
2	6B	need to have some place to go . right ?
2	6B	maybe they could do it at the food bank .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	well , as long as they do n't label their packages , it should be alright .
1	6B	i think we could
1	6B	combine almost all these .
1	6B	we could combine stray cat spaying , dog catcher , veterinary hospital ,
1	6B	pest control , and um , the food bank .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	okay . okay .
2	6B	well , you got ta have teaching certificates because that 's what i have . so .
2	6B	i ca n't help it . but i have a biased -
2	6B	a bias -
2	6B	i 'm just too biased .
2	6B	that would be fine because then , um , i - there would be less competition , for me , for classes .
2	6B	so if we cut all the trunc the teaching certificates , then i would n't hafta compete with other teachers to get classes every quarter .
2	6B	so yeah , we can go ahead and cut that .
2	6B	because currently , i hafta compete with other teachers to get classes .
2	6B	there 'd be fewer teachers certified .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	okay , okay .
2	6B	yeah , because they - they change that all the time .
1	6B	no .
0	6B	i trunc well ,
2	6B	i mean , i just go the same speed everybody else is going .
2	6B	but you do n't need the signs for that .
2	6B	well , yeah . i mean , as - as long as you gauge yourself by the traffic . so you do n't - either case , you do n't need a sign .
2	6B	because we got too many signs now anyway .
2	6B	they 're cutting that , anyway .
2	6B	see , there 's the - the things is , they 're gon na cut it anyway .
2	6B	you know they 're gon na cut it anyway .
2	6B	so , there 's no point in - in making an effort to keep it .
0	6B	yeah , me too .
0	6B	mm-hm . mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	yeah , it 's an oxymoron . yeah .
1	6B	no .
2	6B	uh , i do n't personally have any tattoos . i do n't know about you , but -
2	6B	well , you just hafta make sure that you do n't get whatever , the hepatitis or something like that .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	mm .
2	6B	well , i think they have other ways they can get licenses , without having to -
0	6B	you know , go through a -
0	6B	a county program .
1	6B	well , that 's a good question . uh , is it about safety , or is it about the actual art ?
1	6B	like the ability to actually draw ?
0	6B	mm .
0	6B	mm .
2	6B	yeah , but i mean , if it 's like , i think they would need a license ,
2	6B	if they were expected to do like a rambeau , or like , you know , a nineteenth-century impressionist or romanticist . trunc then they would need a license . otherwise , forget it .
1	6B	yeah , y-
2	6B	if they 're just gon na do like , felix the cat , forget it . i mean , jesus . trunc you would n't need a license for that .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	um .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	wait a minute .
2	6B	uh , trunc they 're pretty bad . they 're pretty bad . yeah , we need -
2	6B	we definitely need to do that . otherwise , the streets are gon na be just -
2	6B	you wo n't be able to drive on em at all .
1	6B	it 's hard to say . it 's kinda -
1	6B	a moot point , is n't it ?
1	6B	yeah , depends on who 's hunting who .
1	6B	i dunno . is this kind of like a dick cheney thing , or - ?
1	6B	eh .
0	6B	tags .
1	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	yeah , that 's a privatized kinda thing , right ?
2	6B	it 's been privatized .
2	6B	it 's a good thing they do n't have air traffic control in here .
2	6B	oh , that 's kinda ridiculous , is n't it ?
0	6B	um .
2	6B	oh , well in my high school , yeah .
2	6B	yeah , we definitely needed to have that .
2	6B	cuz people would climb up the flagpole all the time . that was a significant form of protest , you know . they climb up the flagpole , and they just sit there , and -
0	6B	and then trunc i mean , that would , like ,
2	6B	cause stress fractures in the - in the flagpole .
0	6B	and then you 'd -
0	6B	you know -
2	6B	well , mm-
2	6B	but then you could have lawsuits , you know . trunc do n't forget about the lawsuits . you do n't want the county to be sued .
2	6B	oh , there 's another problem .
2	6B	that 's sposta be taxis ' tops .
2	6B	yeah , there 's a lotta problem with taxis ' tops . cuz you know , that 's where they put the advertise-
2	6B	trunc well , that 's where they put the advertisements , is on the tops , right ?
2	6B	i caught a fish one time in alaska . i did n't have a license .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	okay .
2	6B	and neighborhood watch .
1	6B	oh , i see what you mean . okay . trunc you 're misinterpreting that .
0	6B	or maybe you were correctly interpreting it , and i misinterpret it .
1	6B	oh , yeah . okay . well there 's no point . it 's a trunc yeah , again , it 's another moot point .
2	6B	not for king county . i mean , if - if they mean king county , forget it .
2	6B	pierce county , maybe . they 're a little bit more conservative , you know ? but -
1	6B	football stadium upkeep .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	sorry , but -
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	well , i mean the kids need to stop throwing their trash all over the place . they just need to have their parents , you know , slap em around a little bit .
0	6B	hm .
1	6B	hunting tags .
1	6B	well , i mean , as a - to cut ?
1	6B	uh , okay . okay . yeah , we 'll toss it out . you know , because , i mean -
1	6B	the - those kids , you know , they brought it on themselves .
1	6B	honestly .
1	6B	speed limit signs .
1	6B	yeah , we 're -
1	6B	we 're gon na keep teaching certificates , but we 're gon na get rid of the speed limit signs .
1	6B	oh , yeah , that 's right . i forgot . yeah , you 're right . okay , yeah . so , nix the first two .
2	6B	and the bus stops . and the bus stops .
1	6B	the first three .
1	6B	okay . let 's see .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	and tattoos . yeah . forget it . forget it . and boating licenses . right ?
0	6B	did we say we 're gon na -
0	6B	toss that ? 0
2	6B	well , there 's so many lakes here , and so many boats .
2	6B	i mean , trunc
1	6B	place is full of boats . okay , so we 'll keep that .
2	6B	but the hunting tags , it 's got ta go .
1	6B	right ?
2	6B	and the towing services .
1	6B	oh , yeah , yeah . okay .
1	6B	fine . so .

1	6B	so you have a public animal , not a private animal ?
0	6B	ah , okay . okay . okay , it 's been privatized .

2	6B	yeah , you 're gon na - but they would need - would n't they call that animal control ?
1	6B	not - not dog catcher ?
1	6B	okay . okay . so we got ta keep that , then ?
1	6B	we do ?
1	6B	oh yeah , it 's the same number from each , right ?
0	6B	uh .
2	6B	well the thing is , it - it could come back on us .
0	6B	you know , like ,
1	6B	trunc you got ta think like , ten or twenty years from now , they 're gon na have this truth and reconciliation .
2	6B	and you 're gon na hafta answer for all these cats that you spayed .
2	6B	and it 's like , well i was just doing my job , i - and they 're like , oh , well that 's what they said at auschwitz , you know .
0	6B	so , i mean -
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	veterinarian , i guess .
1	6B	it - it depends on my mood .
0	6B	it trunc
1	6B	it depends on how tired i am .
0	6B	uh , i -
0	6B	oh -
1	6B	actually , it depends on whether or not i 'm teaching .
1	6B	if i 'm teaching - and that 's changed my speech a lot . i 'll say veterinarian .
0	6B	but if i 'm just conversation , you know , like with you or something , i say veterinarian .
2	6B	the only problem is most of the talking i do nowadays is teaching .

1	6B	we can cut em all .
2	6B	and sugar-free juice machines . we do n't need those .
2	6B	and bookkeeping classes . well we do need those .
2	6B	uh , oh well , but those do n't need support , right ? they just kind of exist ?
2	6B	i mean , those are unbreakable .
2	6B	those are like volkswagen bugs . they never break .
2	6B	still drinking the same ones that were
2	6B	made in world war two .
2	6B	well , i mean , if one person , everybody 's gon na get it anyway , so it does n't matter .
1	6B	i mean , a get -
1	6B	trunc have a higher risk of getting cholera through bottled water than you do from those -
1	6B	drinking fountains .
1	6B	statistically speaking .
2	6B	yeah , because they hafta inspect -
1	6B	they hafta inspect the - the fountains , you know .
1	6B	but they do n't have to inspect the bottled water cuz that 's privatized .
1	6B	well , they - they say you can inspect - it 's your own -
0	6B	mm .
0	6B	bottled water .
1	6B	yep . resist it .
0	6B	mm-hm . see , the water that comes from the taps ,
0	6B	any tap water , that 's hasta be inspected .

0	6B	yeah , exactly .
0	6B	ah .
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	okay .
