0	3I	so it was down - it was down at the mariott -
1	3I	oh . too bad . sorry .
2	3I	but it - it , you know , it 's kinda fun . i mean , auditors love to make fun of themselves . it 's like , you know -
2	3I	the great thing about hanging out with auditors is that they 're - it 's kind of like hanging out with accountants . except not - they - auditors do n't have quite the scintillating personality .
0	3I	you know ? um .
0	3I	but , there was this -
0	3I	yes , exactly . there was this - there was this one - this - there was a little bit of whiskey . um . just a little . actually more , you know , like , uh ,
0	3I	artisanal beer-kinda stuff . um .
1	3I	yeah . yeah . we had a good time .
0	3I	but this one guy was giving a presentation , um , from the g_a_o_ .
0	3I	no . no , no no . i heard about that . i think that - i - was that about clinton ? i thought that was like , obama 's people . um .
3	3I	and then , i turned out , and then they started speaking into their wrists , and - and i realized , oh , they 're also part of the secret service . and i 'm like , you ca n't - what are you doing , man ? like , you ca n't do that !
2	3I	like , it was just crazy sexist . it was - it was a little awkward . um . yeah , like -
2	3I	trunc somebody needs to explain that it 's twenty fourteen . okay .
2	3I	tow ropes . i think that would go next to boating supplies . alright .
2	3I	yeah , yeah . yeah . it 's a great idea .
2	3I	we could go near the sugar , ice cream kinda stuff .
1	3I	i mean , if they have pop and you know , other - gatorade , or whatever .
0	3I	yeah . yeah .
1	3I	yeah , let 's put it next to the toilet paper . think so .
2	3I	the hard part is remembering what we 've put and -
2	3I	ca n't move the other ones . scissors .
1	3I	maybe up by the refrigerator magnets ?
1	3I	kay .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	yeah .

1	3I	like , next to refrigerator magnets , maybe ?
1	3I	yeah . totally .
1	3I	kay .
0	3I	that 's interesting that you did that , cuz i actually did the opposite .
0	3I	yeah , i assumed that this was the aisle , and these were the walls .
0	3I	you know ?
1	3I	it trunc i do n't think it matters . you know . we 'll just try and be logic about it .
1	3I	yeah . yeah .
2	3I	yeah , or even down here . if there 's things like the axes and the -
1	3I	wood products and other stuff .
1	3I	kay . cuz see , i still got this heavy cable . i got the large vests in my hand .
1	3I	or i can hang onto it .
2	3I	cuz - i do think that these are all something in the same category . unless we hafta deal with the clothes . but i 'll pull that one out there .
0	3I	you know .
0	3I	food .
1	3I	perfect . yep .
0	3I	dried figs .
1	3I	same thing .
1	3I	you wan na do that ?
1	3I	okay . okay .
2	3I	i - it - it trunc let 's just see how crowded it gets . i mean , that 's the other thing .
0	3I	buckets .
2	3I	put it with the siding .
0	3I	you know . i trunc yeah .
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	box knives . see , i think we 're all kind of in this - box knives , buckets -
0	3I	um .

2	3I	let 's put it with the scissors .
0	3I	liters of water . um .

1	3I	somewhere in that area ?
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	empty plastic jugs .
0	3I	buckets ?
1	3I	kay .
0	3I	axes .

2	3I	trunc um . i 'm gon na do this . so small axes . we can move em around later . heavy cable .
2	3I	i 'm just - here , actually , i 'll put the heavy cable with the power cords .
0	3I	but all these kind of things -
0	3I	the box knives .
1	3I	yeah .
2	3I	but these - these are all - they seem like home depot kind of stuff . you know ?
1	3I	maybe next to the -
1	3I	okay . that works .
1	3I	end of - end of the aisle ?
1	3I	put it there .
1	3I	sticks of butter . um . i think butter should go near the eggs .
0	3I	dairy products . um .
1	3I	yeah . yep . totally .
0	3I	um .
1	3I	here maybe ? i 'm - i 'm thinking like somewhere in the clothing area .
1	3I	kay . the trunc you know what 's gon na happen though , peter ? i 'm gon na forget which ones we had pre-assigned and which ones we put here .
0	3I	well -
0	3I	yeah .
0	3I	absolutely ! i - okay .
0	3I	okay .
0	3I	um .
0	3I	i totally remember eve 's buffet . yes !
0	3I	alright .
0	3I	no , yeah . the - the stadium fred meyer . absolutely . so i useta , um , catch the fifty-one bus ,
0	3I	down and then switch to the twenty-two and catch it up burnside ,
0	3I	to school , and so -
0	3I	yeah . yeah . so , um -
0	3I	yeah , i 've - i 've spent some quality time at the stadium fred meyer .
0	3I	now i 'm trying to remember - there was like , you know , you 'd go downtown , and there were a couple record stores i go to , like django 's and dudley 's and stuff ,
0	3I	i almost wan na say like a tower records . i think it was a tower records . or it mighta been a -
0	3I	any - it mighta been fred meyer 's , right ? but there was that weird , kind of off building that was on the corner of burnside .
0	3I	and i would - you know , if i had ten minutes to kill , i 'd go in and look and see what - what was - what was happening music-wise .
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	they did it .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	well that was - you know - in - in an era of hair metal , that was one of the few places where you could get cool things .
0	3I	uh .
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	oh yeah . um . i - i remember i - what did i - ?
0	3I	i bought sound garden there . i bought a bunch of stuff there .
0	3I	okay . um . rolls of duct tape .
1	3I	this - this area , in the bottom of the first aisle . yeah .
1	3I	why not with the travel guides ? yeah .
2	3I	yeah , i think so . here .
2	3I	we 'll move that .
1	3I	large cups .
1	3I	yep . yep . totally .
2	3I	pouches of oatmeal . same - somewhere in there . maybe - maybe here . it 's like dried goods .
1	3I	trunc half-inch tubing . that 's a power cords - no , that would work .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	i dunno what - what trunc
0	3I	um .
0	3I	yes . um .
2	3I	i think - i think it might be . uh .
1	3I	see , this one to me , it 's like it -
0	3I	does he ?
0	3I	hm !
0	3I	yeah .
0	3I	yeah .
0	3I	um .
2	3I	i - i think , in terms of the whiskey , this is another one we should hang onto .
2	3I	no . no . not - i - i was tempted to put it across from the toys , and then i -
2	3I	you could put this in a stand-alone almost anywhere . i 'd probably put it at the end , by like , books or something . i mean -
0	3I	um .
1	3I	so , yeah , let 's hang onto that one .
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	um .
0	3I	ri-
1	3I	bars of soap , maybe ?
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	canvas bags . um .
2	3I	yeah . or maybe next to the mouse traps ? cuz this is all gon na be plastic stuff , right ?
0	3I	okay .
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	that 's - i think that 's good for now .
0	3I	pre-cut wood .
2	3I	i 'm gon na move the heavy cable .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	do that . like that , or something .
1	3I	yes .
2	3I	totally . here . in fact , put it by the soap .
0	3I	maybe it 's just mint .
1	3I	beets . uh , beets with the -
1	3I	soy beans , cans of peas , all that stuff .
0	3I	now the soy beans were permanent , right ?
2	3I	yeah . okay . cuz we may need to move the oatmeal , and the dried - you know , like - kay .
2	3I	just move it up .
0	3I	light jackets .
0	3I	wet suits .
1	3I	can we put the wet suits there ?
1	3I	with the - with the boating supplies ?
0	3I	ack . what do you use a five-pound weight for ?
0	3I	could be . it could be like a diving thing . yeah .
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	i think - i think - yeah , i think that 'd be -
0	3I	heavy . um .
0	3I	right .
0	3I	well , i mean , you might -
0	3I	that 's what i 'm saying , if you go diving . but - that 's actually a lot . like -
0	3I	you know .
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	or a - you might put , like , five or ten pounds . you - you would n't have like a series of five-pound weights .
1	3I	we 'll just throw it in there .
0	3I	um .
1	3I	why do n't we put it with the weights ? same kinda thing .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	fleece-lined boots . um . were the socks here ? we put all of this here , right ? we picked that .
2	3I	put the boots there .
0	3I	hm .
2	3I	put it right there .
2	3I	yeah .
1	3I	good call .
2	3I	okay . but we can - we can fix this . we could move -
2	3I	the siding hasta stay there .
2	3I	what if we do this ?
1	3I	yeah . we could do that .
1	3I	i 'm thinking of moving them all up , though , so they 're next to the siding , too . go see - you got ta cut siding .
0	3I	so .
1	3I	do this .
0	3I	the plastic jugs just kinda ended up over there .
1	3I	sure .
1	3I	yeah , there you go .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	bagels .
0	3I	i say canvas bag .
0	3I	and i say bagels . yes .
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	uh yeah . that 'll work .
0	3I	yeah .
2	3I	the flags . where - um . let 's put the flags here . just -
0	3I	right .
2	3I	you could do that . um . i actually think we should put vests there for now .
1	3I	yeah . that works . that 's perfect .
1	3I	yeah . put em there .
1	3I	yeah . so we could put em -
1	3I	there .
0	3I	kay . cases of whiskey .
2	3I	right next to the toys . n um .
2	3I	i think so . trunc here 's - i do wan na do this , though . i know this is neurotic . um . i wan na move -
2	3I	the saws and axes and stuff next to the siding . because -
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	yeah . and then the buckets , we can just -
1	3I	i dunno . buckets are fine there .
1	3I	we could do that .
0	3I	right .
1	3I	trunc trunc switch the - yep .
0	3I	buckets , rolls of duct tape , half-inch tubing .
0	3I	mouse traps .
0	3I	mm-hm .
0	3I	um .
0	3I	the only other thing - well , for deck chairs , like a home deck -
1	3I	boating supplies . but i think we 're fine .
1	3I	i think that 's close enough .
1	3I	we could -
1	3I	we could do this .
2	3I	we could do that . we ca n't move the power cords , though . that was one of the permanent ones .
1	3I	we could do this .
1	3I	like that ?
1	3I	and then move the knives in .
1	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	well that 's - and that 's kinda what i 'm looking at . like , if you assume they had to be equal in some proportion . like this one 's equal , but there 's a lot less in these two .
0	3I	i ca n't remember .
1	3I	trunc there you go .
2	3I	no , that 's good . yeah .
2	3I	the - it was cake mix . cake mix hasta be there .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	yeah . you could move -
1	3I	you know , you could trunc we could move packages of cookies up there with the doughnuts and the ice cream and the chocolate bars and stuff .
1	3I	okay .
2	3I	yeah , let 's declare victory .
2	3I	we 'll just move on . and trunc i - you know trunc yes . well done , sir ! um .
0	3I	yeah .
0	6B	yes .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	which expensive should be cut from each department , and choose the same number of items from each department .
0	6B	so .
0	6B	yep .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	we must discuss each - each item and reach an agreement about whether to cut it or continue funding it .
2	6B	i - i disagree .
2	6B	why would anyone wan na be doomed to that narrow of a focus in terms of their future career options ?
0	6B	um .
2	6B	um . i 'm - i 'm gon na disagree with you and say we should keep the math tutors for now .
1	6B	just , you know -
1	6B	because -
1	6B	what is it ? those who ca n't teach , teach p_e_ ? what 's the whole - ?
1	6B	those who ca n't do math -
0	6B	yeah . so , yeah .
0	6B	i - assistant cooks ?
2	6B	really ? why ? why would you hang - ?
3	6B	wait a minute ! why would you hang on to the assistant cooks ?
2	6B	but that 's the thing . look . the - you do n't need an educational program for assistant cooks .
2	6B	cuz you know that the - if the assistant cook is the one on the boat ,
2	6B	he or she would be the one to survive . cuz it 's always the cook that survives , right ?
2	6B	so , um , i do n't think - i do n't think they 'd -
2	6B	they need any more help than they 're already getting .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	they work with large knives . i mean , there 's just - you know .
0	6B	um . sex ed .
0	6B	uh , i -
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	well , you know .
0	6B	so .
1	6B	trunc exactly .
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	so , so far , i would suggest that assistant cooks may be - may be a - a program to cut . custodians ?
2	6B	what is being in a union shop have to do with that thing ?
2	6B	well , yeah , but you 're - every
2	6B	lem me just kinda tell you that everybody in government is gon na be in the , you know ,
2	6B	collectively bargained category . so , if - if you 've got ta cut people , you 're gon na hafta cut people .
2	6B	i would n't cut the custodians .
2	6B	have you ever seen -
2	6B	how public officials maintain their offices ? agh ! be - you know , my seven year old does a better job .
0	6B	yeah , see -
2	6B	it 's a critical role .
2	6B	keep the custodians . speech therapy .
0	6B	speech therapy ?
1	6B	yes .
0	6B	uh , football equipment .
2	6B	um , no . why - ? football equipment ?
0	6B	uh , is that football football or american football ?
0	6B	um .
0	6B	i guess . or we 're - still - we 're maintaining the equipment ? we 're buying the equipment ?
0	6B	um .
1	6B	we must choose the same number -
1	6B	which expenses should be cut from each department . we must choose the same number -
2	6B	so , they 're saying , cut the football equipment expenses . so , it leads me to believe there 's an ongoing expense that we are now not ongoing .
2	6B	or , we 're off-going .
2	6B	what - what are you saying ?
2	6B	are you trunc i work for the county . what are you saying ? you saying that we got moldy football equipment ?
2	6B	come on , man .
0	6B	um .
0	6B	oh ?
0	6B	right .
1	6B	so the hillsdale library maintained the moldy football equipment ?
0	6B	i understand .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	right .
1	6B	okay .
2	6B	well then - but then they 'd come back , and they 'd be like , i remember when they had to cut the football equipment , so i 'm gon na spend my -
2	6B	gazillions on helping out the -
2	6B	youth football .
2	6B	no ! i think we should get rid of it . cut it !
2	6B	cut it !
2	6B	um . acting coaches . clearly the most critical role in all county services are acting coaches .
0	6B	i gotcha .
0	6B	the - the - yes .
0	6B	the - the - right .
1	6B	yeah . cuz the other coaches are being investigated , or something ? right . the acting coaches . um .
2	6B	right . oh , ouch . um .
2	6B	well in that case , maybe we do n't wan na get rid of the acting coaches . uh , poetry books ?
0	6B	poetry books ?
0	6B	i dunno .
0	6B	um .
1	6B	uh . i - i do n't know . i think it depends on the poet .
2	6B	i think we keep the poetry books . how hard can it be to maintain the poetry books ?
2	6B	really ?
1	6B	i 'm thinking like , t_s_ elliot and stuff . um .
0	6B	uh , special ed teachers .
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	mm . could be true .
1	6B	yes . um .
2	6B	you - you make it sound like a virus .
0	6B	um .
0	6B	uh .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	well cuz they 're -
2	6B	they 're mandated to provide those services .
0	6B	federal .
2	6B	kay , so keep em .
0	6B	cooking classes ?
0	6B	eh .
2	6B	well , no . but why - you know . i mean -
2	6B	ca n't people take a cooking class at p_c_c_ or something ? why is the county paying for it ?
2	6B	well that - that actually says a lot . um .
0	6B	uh .
1	6B	maybe we do n't wan na cut em .
0	6B	right . um . so - note-takers . disability services ?
2	6B	do they ? okay . i was gon na say , could n't we just buy everybody an ipad and call it good ?
2	6B	that seems to be the answer .
1	6B	public services ? infrastructure and licensing .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	um .
2	6B	sugar-free juice machines ? i feel like there 's a lotta things in this category that are not -
2	6B	not particularly , um , dynamic .
0	6B	uh . bookkeeping classes , music teachers , sugar-free juice machines .
2	6B	i mean -
2	6B	based on this list , i -
2	6B	the poor assistant cooks go near the top . football equipment goes near the top . for me . like , meaning , get - like we would cut it .
1	6B	cooking classes .
1	6B	bookkeeping classes .
1	6B	yeah , there 's some accounting involved .
2	6B	so i 'd - i 'd wan na get rid of the classes so that it would mean , you know , more long-term , like job preservation . and people were n't -
2	6B	exactly . exactly . so , you know , yeah . if we - we - that gets cut first .
2	6B	we need bad accounting .
0	6B	um .
0	6B	let 's see .
2	6B	well the sugar-free juice trunc that 's a little oxymoronic anyway . i mean , what is sugar-free juice ?
0	6B	you know . i -
0	6B	i - i guess . um .
1	6B	pretty much . um .
1	6B	yes . uh yes . i think -
2	6B	so what they 're saying is water fountains . yes .
1	6B	right .
0	6B	um .
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	so shall we move to the next category , and then we can kinda come back and keep our numbers ? yes .
2	6B	absolutely . i - do n't get rid of the water fountains .
0	6B	um .
1	6B	music teachers . eh .
1	6B	uh , reproductive education . we should probably hang onto that .
1	6B	job training - training programs ? sure .
1	6B	chicken pox vaccinations ? sounds good . invasive species removal ?
0	6B	um .
1	6B	yeah . yep .
0	6B	s_t_d_ education , toxic waste disposal , hospital additions .
2	6B	bagel factory inspections .
2	6B	absolutely the most critical role that the county can play , is bagel factory inspections .
0	6B	um .
0	6B	yeah . i think so . was n't it ?
0	6B	was under , um .
0	6B	was it under public safety ? it was under , uh -
0	6B	yeah , environmental - environmental safety .
0	6B	um , needle exchange , sex offender database , veterans medical assistance , egg farm regulations , weed control . prenatal check-ups and neighborhood watch support ?
2	6B	geez ! and none of these things i would really get rid of compared about - trunc five or six on the other one . um .
2	6B	i think they do do that now , do n't they ?
0	6B	do the - do the weed control ?
2	6B	mm-kay . i 'm with you on weed control .
0	6B	um .
0	6B	um . i dunno .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	what - getting rid of neighborhood watch . what could go wrong ?
1	6B	what could go wrong ?
0	6B	i mean -
2	6B	that 's - that 's what we need . we need everybody to be armed .
2	6B	then - yeah . then we do n't need any regulation . okay . oh -
0	6B	i - i have not seen it . i 'm not - i 've -
0	6B	uh-huh . and then he starts pepper spraying everybody .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	there you go . um .
0	6B	right .
2	6B	so , yeah . i think we could cut the neighborhood watch support , and instead , just give them all pepper spray and weapons . and - yeah .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	pick axes . i think , you know -
1	6B	um . pitch forks , torches .
2	6B	um . yes . trunc oh , my .
1	6B	uh , okay .
0	6B	toxic waste disposal ?
2	6B	now see here 's my question . if we cut the toxic waste disposal program ,
2	6B	does that mean that people will dispose of their toxic waste in another county ?
2	6B	so why do n't - let 's just do that , and then they 'll take it all to pierce county .
2	6B	was n't that what you do now ?
2	6B	you know , and i 've used motor oil . i just kind of , you know , spread it around in my back yard .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	especially , you know -
1	6B	i just look for those drains that are stenciled with the salmon pictures and make sure that i put em down there . cuz i figure it 's good for the salmon .
0	6B	right , right .
0	6B	um .
0	6B	okay .
0	6B	um . recreation and public services . stray cat spaying , public news station , food bank , junior -
0	6B	uh , i do . i have cats - i have a cat and a dog . living together . mass hysteria . um .

0	6B	uh , soup kitchens .
0	6B	the kitten and puppy adoptions services ?
0	6B	um .
1	6B	that 's distinctly possible . but , you know , it 's not - we 're - we 're -
1	6B	we 're - uh , yeah .
2	6B	i trunc i think the difference would be that because there was a kitten-puppy adoption service ,
2	6B	that there was somebody to facilitate the adopting of the kitten and-or puppy .
2	6B	yes , absolutely .
1	6B	um . you know , i mean , you could always go with the , uh -
1	6B	i do n't know . most of the world -
1	6B	greece -
1	6B	thailand slash approach , where could just have the dogs and the cats running around doing everything .

0	6B	um . dog catcher .
1	6B	how - how we gon na have kittens and puppies to - ?
2	6B	trunc well what are they gon na do when they get the dog ?
2	6B	i - i 'm just worried about the kitten and puppy adoption service , if they do n't have a dog catcher to catch the kittens and puppies to be adopted .
2	6B	maybe we need a cat catcher in there .
3	6B	there is no cat catcher !
3	6B	holy -
1	6B	the dog trunc okay .
1	6B	dog catcher and stray cat spaying . yes .
0	6B	the boys basketball club ?
0	6B	who ?
0	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	i think that 's - i actually think - as a county employee , i think that 's a brilliant idea . what they should do is -
2	6B	they should take trunc force me to take my lunch hour , and just reassign everybody who does all these other public functions to go do dog catching .
1	6B	you know , for an hour or two . uh , every week . yeah , okay . yeah .
0	6B	yep .

0	6B	reusable bag campaign .
0	6B	reusable bag campaign .
2	6B	well , i was gon na say . i mean .
1	6B	i - i know .
2	6B	i do n't know why you 'd need a special -

2	6B	so - i - i 'm not taking my dog to a county hospital . i 'm taking my dog to the , you know -
1	6B	the west seattle vet . so ,
2	6B	i do n't know that the county needs to pay for veterinary hospitals . like -
0	6B	yeah . um .
0	6B	i trunc
2	6B	well , trunc yeah , but you could pay - i mean , if you have - if you have a program for stray cat spaying .
2	6B	they could do that at someone else 's , you know , vet hospital . they could do that -
2	6B	i do n't know . i just do n't know that the county needs to pay for that .
2	6B	they could do it at the food trunc that is a great idea .

0	6B	uh , so -
2	6B	trunc okay , we 're gon na hafta come back and figure out what we 're cutting . but i think we have a good sense of what it is that we would cut in that category .
2	6B	starting with the -
2	6B	veterinarian .
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing .
2	6B	trunc like i said , we can cut that immediately .
0	6B	um .
2	6B	why ?

2	6B	well they just spent - you know , i mean - it 's - i do n't know about you , but i - i do ride the bus . and there 's - they have the rapid ride lines .
2	6B	which i think is funny , because a ride implies that you can sit down , right ? and so , rapid ride , it 's neither rapid nor a ride . right ?
2	6B	um . so no additional bus stops .
0	6B	uh . tattoo artist licenses ?
2	6B	do - trunc i do . we - we do n't - we do n't need to talk about that .
0	6B	um .
2	6B	so , uh , but tattoo - why -
2	6B	you 're going to a tattoo artist . do you think that they 're going to be licensed ?
2	6B	is that really a reasonable expectation ?
2	6B	i thought that was - i thought that was - they put that -
2	6B	you know , there was like , hey , you got that for free . you know ?
2	6B	normally it 's ten dollars extra , but today , we 'll make sure that you only get hep b_ .

2	6B	i 've actually done seventeen scorpions tattoos , and so you get some sort of special -
0	6B	yeah , okay . yeah .
1	6B	right , exactly .

0	6B	um .
0	6B	is that like a tag for hunters ?
0	6B	yeah . um .
0	6B	i do n't know . is like , what do you do ? do you like , run up and tag somebody as they 're hunting , and say , you 're it ? i -
0	6B	um .

2	6B	yeah .
2	6B	um .
1	6B	uh -
0	6B	massage trunc massage certificates ?
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	is that like a trunc do they give you a certificate suitable for framing after you had a massage ? is that what - ? i do n't -
1	6B	do they mean like a certification ?
1	6B	message certificates , yes .
0	6B	you 've got mail .

1	6B	definitely a vitally important thing .
0	6B	public trunc
2	6B	public bus upkeep . well they 're not really doing it now . so , um -
0	6B	and drainage ditches .
2	6B	alright , so - what do we - let 's - why do n't we pick one from each category to cut , and then maybe pick another - let 's just do it .
0	6B	across the board . so -
2	6B	education programs ? do you wan na cut assistant cooks ?
1	6B	kay .
1	6B	public health and safety ?
0	6B	uh , weed control ?
0	6B	i mean , it - it is legal now .
1	6B	yeah . so -
1	6B	yes .

0	6B	football stadium upkeep . i 'm with you . okay .
0	6B	hunting tags ?
0	6B	trunc you 're - you 're - you 're not going with flagpole repair ? that 's a critical category for you , is n't it ? you -
1	6B	i -
2	6B	kay .
0	6B	the - yes , the trunc the -
1	6B	no weed control .
1	6B	no assistant cooks . so let 's go back the other direction then .
1	6B	um .
1	6B	uh , are we getting rid of teaching certificates ? speed limit signs .
0	6B	i thought if we got rid of the teaching certificates , you got -
1	6B	you were -
1	6B	okay . so , okay , trunc
0	6B	okay . we 'll nix the first three .
1	6B	kay . one , two , three .
1	6B	kay . can we get three out of every - ? then we 'd have four in every category . i think that 's pretty good .
1	6B	so no teaching certificates , no speed limit signs . who needs speed limit signs ? additional bus stops ,
2	6B	and tattoo artist licenses . okay .
1	6B	well , you know -
2	6B	it 's kind of like a driver 's license . like , you know .
2	6B	right .
1	6B	we could w-
0	6B	but trunc but see -
0	6B	this is what concerns me . is trunc if we got like five things in this category , i dunno that we can get five out of every other category .
2	6B	so let 's go with those three for now .
2	6B	um .
0	6B	football stadium .
1	6B	well , we already got rid of the football stadium upkeep .
1	6B	so , reusable bags , veterinary hospital , yes , no ?

1	6B	yeah , but that - trunc i try not to - that 's a - we do n't talk about that in public .
1	6B	yes . uh .
0	6B	no , that 's - well ,
0	6B	it 's my own .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	um .
0	6B	we 're getting rid of the veterinarian , we 're getting rid of the reusable bag campaign -
0	6B	and we 're getting rid of what ?

0	6B	actually , yeah , it 's kind of - it 's par for the course now .
0	6B	but that 's the thing , is ,
2	6B	you do n't run around and do it trunc i think they should get - i think you 're right . they should cut that program .
2	6B	trunc trunc somebody on the block had chicken pox ,
2	6B	all the kids went over to their house and played with em and did all that stuff , so that the kids would all catch chicken pox and have it when they were young .
2	6B	yeah . so , you know .
2	6B	besides , trunc i - i think that vaccinations - i do n't - i - they just -
0	6B	lead to all kinds of crazy things . you know . um .
1	6B	fluoridation of water , and -
1	6B	so , uh , yeah . no vaccinations whatsoever .
2	6B	um .
1	6B	can we - can we ban all vaccinations ? is that a possibility in this category , or - ?

0	6B	i 'm - i 'm being very , very sarcastic .
0	6B	when you were - when you were - ? i remember we usta hafta swish with the little fluoride cups . yeah . oh , i did it .
