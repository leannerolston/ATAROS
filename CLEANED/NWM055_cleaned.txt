1	3I	so we can start out by , like , taking a few , or do you wanna just talk about how it is first ? 
1	3I	yeah . 
2	3I	yeah , i mean , i would put milk there . 
1	3I	or butter , cuz we don't have milk . 
1	3I	where would you put , like , produce ? i guess beets were really the only thing on there that would be - 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	what about , like , toiletry stuff ? i was thinking here , but - 
2	3I	definitely wetsuits i 'd put close to the boating supplies . 
1	3I	like , fish hooks and - 
0	3I	cool . 
0	3I	thanks . 
0	3I	and i have hats , loose-leaf paper , and egg timers . 
1	3I	we trunc we didn't talk about where we 're gonna put clothing . 
1	3I	i wonder if we have enough space to have a trunc clothing section here or something ? 
2	3I	yeah . and , like , have few tools here , maybe . 
1	3I	yeah . 
2	3I	so , hats , maybe up here ? 
2	3I	i 'd either put it with the power cords or with the siding . 
1	3I	hm , right there . 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	like , here ? 
2	3I	yeah . i have egg timers , which i think should go with the refrigerator magnets . 
1	3I	above it or below it ? 
1	3I	yeah . trunc 
0	3I	um . 
2	3I	i would say kitchen-y stuff , but - 
0	3I	loose-leaf paper . 
1	3I	with the travel guides . 
1	3I	like up here ? yeah , cuz we have books . 
1	3I	yeah . 
0	3I	thank you . 
0	3I	box knives , chocolate bars , tweezers , and mint toothpaste . 
1	3I	toothpaste with the - 
2	3I	tweezers . 
1	3I	here ? and then toothpaste . 
1	3I	here , or - right . 
2	3I	i 'll just put it here . well , i guess there 's face cream , so - 
0	3I	there we go . now it's velcroed . 
1	3I	yeah that 's - 
2	3I	right by the heavy cable . 
1	3I	that sounds good . 
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts 
2	3I	we could have a sweet section here with chocolate bars , boxes of doughnuts , cake . 
2	3I	yeah . but that 's more , like , baking stuff . yeah . 
2	3I	do we want it up close to the ice cream ? 
1	3I	yeah . 
2	3I	yeah , that 's a good idea also . like , thinking of , like , what people would buy together . 
1	3I	yeah . 
0	3I	box knives . 
2	3I	do we have a weapons section ? should be with the tools . 
2	3I	question is , heavy cable area , or the power cords down here ? 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	yeah , the electric heaters . 
1	3I	well i can hold on to it , and we can - 
2	3I	yeah , the outdoor thing . maybe , like , underneath the siding ? i don't know . 
2	3I	we could also just make it a really confusing store , so that - then people would be , like , looking for one thing and then you find something else . 
0	3I	hm . 
0	3I	that 's interesting . 
0	3I	so , i have pre-cut wood , electric heaters , bars of soap , heavy coats , and box knives again . 
0	3I	hats are up there . 
1	3I	just put the coats right next to them ? 
2	3I	i 'm going to put my bars of soap - 
2	3I	either here or here . 
2	3I	there 's also probably face cream . 
1	3I	it probably doesn't - 
1	3I	i mean - 
2	3I	i 'll just put it here . 
0	3I	pre-cut wood . 
2	3I	yeah , that 's what i was thinking . the electric heaters , trunc we were saying could go near the power cords . 
1	3I	trunc pre-cut wood here , maybe ? 
0	3I	buckets and cups . 
2	3I	maybe with the kitchen stuff . 
2	3I	but buckets . 
1	3I	yeah . 
2	3I	or for house cleaning . 
1	3I	maybe somewhere in this , like , zone ? 
1	3I	yeah , yeah . 
1	3I	works for me . 
0	3I	box knives . 
1	3I	yeah . 
2	3I	we could put some tools in here . like , saw , box knives - 
2	3I	or , could it go with the mousetraps . 
1	3I	because i 'm thinking what else would go in that category ? 
2	3I	cuz this could be , like , kind of a tool wrap around , or - 
2	3I	usually don't they have them closer to the front's of stores , so they can see people stealing them ? 
2	3I	maybe here . 
1	3I	or , do trunc i don't know . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	yeah . that works . books in between the loose-leaf paper and the travel guides ? 
1	3I	perfect . 
0	3I	um , five-pound weights ? 
0	3I	i think so , yeah . 
1	3I	here ? 
2	3I	and then i also have thick sweaters , which i 'd put near the heavy coats . 
1	3I	perfect . 
2	3I	maybe with trunc bundles of sticks ? feel like - 
1	3I	outdoor - 
1	3I	gardening stuff . 
2	3I	i have packages of cookies , socks , rolls of duct tape , and bottle of juice . i would put the cookies with the - 
1	3I	doughnuts . 
0	3I	small axes . 
2	3I	we could ! 
1	3I	yeah . 
2	3I	but maybe it's good to have the tools kind of in one area . 
1	3I	yeah , perfect . 
0	3I	well i have socks . 
1	3I	yeah , i don't know . 
0	3I	i don't remember . 
1	3I	socks here , maybe ? 
2	3I	well i have the juice . we could put - 
2	3I	water , juice , whiskey . 
0	3I	duct tape . 
2	3I	with the tools ? or with the stationary stuff ? 
2	3I	i 'd put it with the tools . 
1	3I	like , here ? 
1	3I	i 'd put it with the boating supplies , maybe . 
0	3I	fish hooks.
2	3I	pouches of oatmeal . i 'd put that with the - with the cake mix . 
2	3I	shoelaces ? put it underneath socks . 
1	3I	oatmeal . where would you put that ? 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	here or here ? 
2	3I	yeah this works for me . 
0	3I	yeah . 
0	3I	hm , we don't really have any other fresh produce . 
1	3I	works for me . 
1	3I	trunc perfect . 
0	3I	backpacks . 
2	3I	yeah , that would work . that would work . 
0	3I	i have large vests . 
0	3I	hm , yeah . 
0	3I	and bagels 
1	3I	bagels , i think that 's an easier solution . 
2	3I	gas-powered cookstoves ? i 'd put it with the pre-cut wood . 
2	3I	cuz maybe it's , like camping-y - 
0	3I	stuff . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	tweezers , yeah . 
1	3I	power cords ? yeah . 
2	3I	that works . it's - it's close enough . 
1	3I	trunc the buckets and large cups ? 
0	3I	and large vests ? 
2	3I	just - we can just put it here . 
1	3I	and bagels . with the - right here ? 
0	3I	we 're done ! 
0	6B	what else would i cut ? 
0	6B	um . 
2	6B	i would cut invasive species removal , and i would try to make it volunteer-based . because that 's the kinda thing that kids 'd do for like , volunteer hours . and it's kinda fun , and like , gets kids involved with community clean-up , and would reduce like , the cost of employing people to do it . 
0	6B	where 'd you go for high school ? 
0	6B	what about that private jewish school that you went to ? 
0	6B	is that at temple b'nai torah ? or is that - ? 
0	6B	oh really ? oh . 
0	6B	oh , okay . 
1	6B	aw , that 's terrible . 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	i useta go there . 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	no . 
0	6B	my parents now go to a synagogue in woodinville , and i haven't like , really gone . 
0	6B	yeah . how bout you ? 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	yeah , yeah . same . 
0	6B	yeah , me neither . 
0	6B	it's like - er - 
1	6B	i know we 're getting distracted , but - 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	um . what else would i cut ? 
2	6B	cuz you 'd think that would be a source of revenue for the - 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	i mean , it sucks to cut recreation , but - 
2	6B	does the county really need to pay for the junior soccer league ? 
2	6B	or cooking classes ? 
1	6B	yeah . like football equipment , maybe the families of the - on the football team or the booster club should raise money for that instead of the county . 
2	6B	well then maybe they wouldn't hafta have a football team anymore . 
2	6B	they 'd do cheaper sports , like frisbee or running . 
1	6B	soccer . 
1	6B	football's really expensive . like the equipment per person , per athlete . 
1	6B	trunc yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	sugar-free juice machines hafta go . 
2	6B	i trunc i wouldn't wanna take away music teachers . i think it's really important to have music . 
1	6B	but i wonder if that 's the kinda thing where they could get parents who 're - to do like , an art docent type thing , but probably not with music , cuz you - 
0	6B	acting coaches ? 
0	6B	hm . 
1	6B	i dunno . 
2	6B	i don't like cutting the arts . 
1	6B	yeah . even though i was an athlete , like all through college and high school , 
2	6B	and junior high , i would - i feel more trunc i feel worse about cutting the arts . cuz i feel like people can always just do sports trunc for whatever , but arts are something that you need more like - 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	and there are plenty of kids who maybe wouldn't have access to that . but they could still play soccer on the street with their friends . like - 
1	6B	but like - yeah . 
0	6B	um . 
2	6B	tattoo artist licenses ? that seems like ,  really specific for adult education . 
0	6B	yeah . i mean - 
2	6B	yeah , it should be . 
2	6B	but if it's like a  class , it shouldn't be offered through the county . 
2	6B	i dunno . i don't want - i don't feel comfortable cutting the low-income programs . 
0	6B	what's the difference between a food bank and a soup kitchen ? i guess a soup kitchen you come in , you get a hot meal , and a food bank you get supplies to cook at home . 
2	6B	maybe those would be things , though , that you trunc that you could like , look for churches or um - 
1	6B	like , service groups that trunc would be willing to increase their funding of it . 
0	6B	sex offender database . 
1	6B	how - trunc how much money does that really cost ? 
1	6B	and how many sex offenders are there , really ? 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	or they could be someone who's like , 
2	6B	you know , urinated in public a few too many times . and they 're registered as a sex offender . 
2	6B	and then they lose their right to privacy , and all that . 
2	6B	can't trunc can't buy housing , and - 
2	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	yeah , i 'm not either . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	it seems weird to me that the same county that has a subway would also have - 
2	6B	hunting and fishing . 
2	6B	cuz i 'm thinking that like , a - a city that is big enough to have that like , level of infrastructure , like taxis , and uh , subway and buses , 
2	6B	would also have enough land - 
1	6B	i don't know . 
0	6B	what are hunting tags ? 
1	6B	yeah . 
3	6B	i mean , who really watches the public trunc access station ? that 'd be pretty easy to cut . and then no one would notice except for like , a few people in the retirement home . 
0	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	sure . 
0	6B	i think we 're done . 
0	6B	did you know that the trunc washington state government gives twice as much money to boeing as it does to the university of washington ? 
2	6B	isn't that crazy ? i just learned that today . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	to keep them in state . 
2	6B	it 'd be equally important to invest - at  least equally important to invest in , like , the biggest university and research - 
1	6B	i dunno . 
2	6B	well , fortunately , it seems like we have similar values . so this could be easier . 
0	6B	so - um . 
2	6B	we can start with two from each . 
2	6B	let's cut note-takers . 
1	6B	from disability services . 
2	6B	cuz you can get students to do that . yeah . 
2	6B	sugar-free juice machines . screw em . we don't need em . 
0	6B	um . public health and safety . 
1	6B	what would you cut ? 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	weed control ? i - i don't think - 
2	6B	just - we 'll just call them plants . they 're plants . 
2	6B	invasive species removal ? 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	um . and recreation and public services . 
0	6B	i don't know . 
0	6B	i was thinking like a community bulletin or something . 
0	6B	of like , events . 
1	6B	i think that 's somewhat important . 
0	6B	um . 
1	6B	yeah , let's cut that . 
2	6B	football stadium upkeep ? here's my idea . 
2	6B	the fans can volunteer - 
3	6B	yeah ! if they love to watch football so much , then they can clean up the stadium . 
2	6B	well , no . no , they could like , set up - 
2	6B	well i guess you 'd - you 'd probably - if it's a - a real football stadium , and not like a high school football stadium , you 'd need like , skilled people to f- 
2	6B	and if it brings in money to the town , then it - maybe it's - maybe it's good to have a football stadium . 
0	6B	um . 
0	6B	kitten and puppy adoption . 
2	6B	they should just have like a little picture of like - 
1	6B	cute kittens and puppies , and you know like - 
1	6B	feel guilty . 
1	6B	how many stray dogs are there ? 
1	6B	i mean , it 'd be - it 'd be almost better to just have more like , spaying . 
1	6B	or cats . 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	so - 
2	6B	public access and maybe the - 
1	6B	dog catcher ? 
0	6B	i always picture like , is that - is it the fox and the hound , or trunc one of those movies . 
0	6B	lady and the tramp ? 
0	6B	yeah , with the scary dog catcher . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	it's horrifying . 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	a trunc a road ? a curb ? 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	massage cer- ? that 's a very specific - 
1	6B	tattoo artist licenses and massage certificates . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	and there are only so many tattoo artists and massage therapists who can work in a given area , right ? 
2	6B	so maybe then we just decide that we have enough right now . 
2	6B	we 're not gonna be accepting any new ones . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	i feel like pothole maintenance is pretty important . 
1	6B	i wonder if towing services is something that could be privatized . 
2	6B	i mean that and taxi stops - 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	i think so . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	i think two from each is a good - 
1	6B	i don't either . 
0	6B	four . 
0	6B	eight . 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	twelve . 
0	6B	sixteen . 
0	6B	so we 're cutting like - 
0	6B	over ten percent of the trunc of the programs . for - cut two from each . 
1	6B	so that hasta be a pretty good - 
1	6B	budget reduction . 
2	6B	but then what's the point of having a government ? if you just cut every service ?
