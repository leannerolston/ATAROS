1	3I	i think -
1	3I	it looks like we have -
1	3I	an edge wall , and edge wall , and then three -
1	3I	central sets of shelving with shelves on either side . now there 's nothing put on this side of this -
1	3I	wall , but i 'm sure that it will fit .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	four aisles . correct .
0	3I	home supplies . right .
0	3I	right .
0	3I	mm-hmm .
0	3I	mm-hmm .
0	3I	mm-hmm . housewares .
0	3I	bulk cooking .
0	3I	right .
1	3I	refrigerated section . right . pretty clearly with the - with the freezer section up there , and the refrigerated down there . alright shall we - ? shall we begin ?
0	3I	heavy coats .
1	3I	well that seems like personal effects , and we do n't have clothing on the - on the line yet so we can -
1	3I	we can begin to establish a clothing section .
1	3I	i think you 're right .
1	3I	interesting um -
2	3I	i suspect that we are dealing with the same list that we had or roughly the same list that we had in our first one . so as i recall there were -
2	3I	quite a number of clothes
2	3I	so i would put them somewhere with plenty of space -
2	3I	in anticipation of wanting to put the clothes next to each other .
1	3I	sounds -
1	3I	ideal .
1	3I	sounds ideal .
1	3I	right . sounds perfect .
1	3I	sounds very -
0	3I	uh -
1	3I	forecasting , yes -
1	3I	i have bottles of juice . i would suggest putting them next to the eggs in the refrigerated section . alright .
1	3I	on the far righthand aisle .
0	3I	bars of soap .
1	3I	that makes sense . that 's toiletries .
1	3I	i think behind would be fine .
1	3I	packages of cookies . ooh ! a pre-processed food .
1	3I	uh , that does not require refrigeration , and we have a whole -
1	3I	unused aisle .
1	3I	across from the refrigerated section .
1	3I	i would put them next to cake mix . that would make sense to me . i think a lot of stores put their baking good and their baked goods next to each other .
1	3I	definitely .
1	3I	as when i think of both boating supplies and gas powered cook stoves , i think of camping . i would -
1	3I	i would advocate for near the boating supplies .
1	3I	large vests ! ah , we have more clothes .
1	3I	how about next to the travel guides and heavy coats ?
1	3I	alright , both heavy winter wear .
1	3I	dried figs ! a , uh bulk -
1	3I	good . um -
1	3I	maybe near the soybean because it 's a - it 's a non-perishable produce item .
0	3I	alright .
0	3I	fish hooks .
1	3I	makes sense .
1	3I	very logical .
0	3I	mint toothpaste .
1	3I	uh , perhaps near the toilet paper and bars of soap ?
1	3I	perhaps below the bars of soap ?
0	3I	alright .
1	3I	that makes sense .
1	3I	correct in case of .
1	3I	in case of more specific items .
0	3I	alright . let 's see .
1	3I	cushions for deck chairs . this seems like and outdoor -
1	3I	uh , but not -
1	3I	excursion item , so i would suggest somewhere near -
1	3I	the siding or the power cords .
1	3I	perhaps with a bit of space down from the siding .
0	3I	alright .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
1	3I	that makes sense .
0	3I	i do n't know . i do n't know if it matters .
0	3I	at this point .
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	perhaps -
1	3I	next to the large vests , or perhaps -
1	3I	offer some space .
1	3I	across from them .
1	3I	more - more vestments than accessories , alright .
1	3I	definitely in the dairy section .
0	3I	alright .
0	3I	oop !
0	3I	making rustling .
1	3I	five pound weights . do you know what five pound weights are used for ? i certainly do n't .
0	3I	okay .
0	3I	hardware . home improvement .
0	3I	mm-hmm .
0	3I	the camping area -
1	3I	how would you feel about putting them across from the camping gear in case we encounter other exercise equipment ? so we 'll put them -
1	3I	across the aisle from the boating supplies .
0	3I	alright .
0	3I	heavy cable .
1	3I	either near the hardware area down with the rolls of duct tape and power cords -
1	3I	or somewhere up -
1	3I	near the -
1	3I	construction equipment .
1	3I	makes sense .
1	3I	so next to the rolls of duct tape and power cords , but need immediately adjacent . alright .
1	3I	let 's see what we have here .
1	3I	um , but perhaps with a bit of space as they are a -
1	3I	non -
0	3I	um -
0	3I	what is the word i am looking for ?
1	3I	uh , in-
1	3I	a non- trunc thank you . a non-disposable .
1	3I	toiletry .
1	3I	absolutely .
1	3I	now we have a - a stack of heavy winter wear .
0	3I	alright .
0	3I	let 's see what we have now .
1	3I	buckets ! i think buckets is solidly home improvement and camping .
1	3I	so maybe in the middle of the aisle between the five pound weights and the heavy cable ?
1	3I	for ease of access to both departments .
0	3I	small axes .
0	3I	mm-hmm .
1	3I	alright .
0	3I	right .
1	3I	well that makes sense .
0	3I	alright .
0	3I	let 's see . i 'll draw one out of the middle .
1	3I	bagels ! so bagels -
1	3I	seem to belong near packages of cookies , simply by virtue of being a baked good . does that sound - ?
1	3I	reasonable ? or - ?
0	3I	mm-hmm .
0	3I	huh .
0	3I	trunc
0	3I	utility scissors .
1	3I	i think we have the power to decide .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	yes , we have the power to decide which ones we ordered .
0	3I	which scissors did we order , emily ? i ca n't seem to recall .
1	3I	alright , some big heavy duty utility scissors .
1	3I	right right . that 's the - the -
1	3I	miscellaneous sharp implements area . alright . oop ! i drew two . there you are .
1	3I	um , beets . well , beets are a fresh produce item , and we do n't have a fresh produce aisle yet .
1	3I	luckily .
1	3I	how does that look over - ?
1	3I	on the opposite side of the self from the sugar ?
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	absolutely .
0	3I	alright .
0	3I	see what we have .
1	3I	liters of water . that sounds -
1	3I	almost positively like either a camping or a - oh , it 's liters , not gallons . it 's small bottles of water .
0	3I	um -
0	3I	liters of water .
1	3I	refrigerated ?
1	3I	bottles of juice . good idea .
2	3I	flags !
1	3I	absolutely .
1	3I	that makes sense . it 's outdoor home items .
1	3I	alright .
1	3I	this is true . this is true . so they might apply to the camping sections as well .
0	3I	ooh ! paper bags .
1	3I	well , we have buckets there , so we have containers in the sort of camping and outdoor-ware section .
0	3I	um -
1	3I	but there 's also mousetraps , which is sort of disposable indoor household miscellany .
1	3I	as we have plenty of things in the camping outdoor-ware section .
1	3I	probably .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	so we have trunc extra space .
1	3I	that makes sense .
0	3I	right .
0	3I	right .
1	3I	and this is becoming a bit of a back to school section it seems here with the backpacks and the toys .
1	3I	large cups . ooh , large cups ! this is a -
1	3I	home item -
0	3I	um -
1	3I	i would be inclined to put it near the mousetraps , paper bags almost ? does that sound reasonable ? alright put that there but give it a little bit of space above the mousetraps .
1	3I	empty plastic jugs . that sounds like a container .
1	3I	this is surprisingly fun .
1	3I	bundles - bundles of sticks , that sounds like fire lighting to me . i ca n't think of anything anyone would use bundles of sticks for at this time of the season .
0	3I	you know , i discovered that they did myself on a camping trip last week . i did not know they sold them either , bu t apparently they do .
1	3I	so i will put them next to the gas powered cookstoves . um -
1	3I	oh ! perhaps -
1	3I	directly - yes , so that -
1	3I	can get all of your fire lighting needs taken care of .
1	3I	box knives . oh well , we do have a cutting things section . how about the box knives on the - ?
1	3I	end of the aisle in the cutting things section . alright . in home supplies , near axes and scissors .
0	3I	books of matches .
0	3I	mm-hmm .
1	3I	disposable household items . that makes sense .
1	3I	very nice .
0	3I	alright .
0	3I	canvas bags .
1	3I	oh , canvas bags could be used for shopping . they could be used for camping .
0	3I	um -
1	3I	we do sort of have a home -
1	3I	containers section .
0	3I	uh -
0	3I	alright , so the , uh -
1	3I	jugs and buckets ? are we thinking next to the empty plastic jugs and the buckets ?
1	3I	yes , it does .
1	3I	small saws . oh good ! more material for our -
1	3I	uh , are -
1	3I	sharp implements section .
1	3I	perhaps across the aisle from the small axes ?
1	3I	unquestionably .
1	3I	a household disposable personal toiletry .
1	3I	oh . cases of whiskey .
1	3I	now this is interesting because it 's not individual bottles , but rather cases .
0	3I	mm-hmm .
0	3I	toward the other beverages ?
2	3I	but -
2	3I	but not , perhaps , in the refrigerated section so -
1	3I	nearby , at the end of the aisle -
1	3I	tow ropes . well , we do have -
1	3I	cables , cords , and rolls of duct tape there , but we also have boating supplies up there .
1	3I	do you have a - a rope , spool , and coil section ?
1	3I	that sounds perfect .
1	3I	we 've got a -
1	3I	solid store organization .
1	3I	arising from the chaos . boxes of donuts ! now i 'm getting hungry .
1	3I	uh , well we have packages of cookies and bagels right here , so my inclination would be to -
1	3I	fill the boxes of donuts right into the -
1	3I	empty space .
0	3I	half inch tubing .
1	3I	i think we could . we have some extra room there .
1	3I	let 's shift those back . there we are .
1	3I	perfect
1	3I	ooh ! shoelaces . that looks like a clothing supply to me , but not a -
1	3I	major vestment rather a -
1	3I	good point .
1	3I	incidentals , excellent point .
1	3I	everywhere .
1	3I	that makes sense . they can be a baking supply .
1	3I	it does .
1	3I	it 's true . i do n't want the beets to be lonely .
1	3I	i hope so , beets are so lonely so often .
0	3I	um -
1	3I	electric , nobody cooks with -
1	3I	uh , electric heaters -
1	3I	electric heaters , uh - perhaps near the deck chairs and siding ? is there a - a home supply ?
1	3I	i 'm picturing outdoor electric heaters . i do n't know why . it 's not specify .
0	3I	summer .
1	3I	yeah , we can decide what we ordered .
1	3I	oh ! definitely a cold weather item .
1	3I	ooh , yes ! as - as an accessory .
1	3I	either near the large cups or near the baking supplies depending on whether we want to -
1	3I	start a little -
1	3I	flatware , and houseware , and cookware area or whether we want -
1	3I	all our baking supplies in
1	3I	alright . i 'll put it next to the , uh - the trunc large cups , so we have a small houseware section .
0	3I	cans of peas .
1	3I	well , that 's a -
1	3I	bulk non-perishable , or we could make the beets less lonely . they 're both vegetables .
1	3I	this is true . this is true .
1	3I	we need canned beets . yes .
1	3I	makes sense .
1	3I	not right next door .
0	3I	loose leaf paper . alright , um -
1	3I	perhaps near the books , and what is shaping up to be the school supply section .
1	3I	so we could put them either near the books where it would -
0	3I	um -
1	3I	seem to be a stationary area , or near the backpacks .
1	3I	as it 's august , i 'd agree . yeah .
0	3I	socks !
1	3I	that sounds good .
1	3I	i think we 're going to be able to open the store on time .
1	3I	g of peet moss , that sounds like a outdoor gardening and household -
1	3I	equipment that people might be looking for they 're doing their patio , right next to the deck chairs .
1	3I	perfect , then we have our -
1	3I	camping and fishing supply section complete .
1	3I	good job . i think we 're done .
1	3I	great .
1	3I	that looks like a great store . i would shop there . i do n't know about those earlier stores .
0	3I	yep .
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	well let 's look at what we have , and then figure out what we think we can afford to cut .
1	6B	uh , and then try to balance it .
1	6B	equally .
1	6B	what 's the easiest one to look at first ?
0	6B	um -
1	6B	to me the easiest one to look at is recreation and public services
1	6B	because it 's - it a - an area where it breaks almost entirely cleanly into -
1	6B	vital life assistance like soup kitchens and housing assistance , and -
1	6B	things like -
1	6B	the junior soccer league , which while doubtless greatly beloved will not leave anyone hungry on the street if it 's cut .
0	6B	uh -
1	6B	and the other question is what - what do we - as you said , what do we think either the community will rally to support regardless or a - is - is easily privatized without -
1	6B	uh , damaging programs .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	let 's find what we - we definitely do n't think we can afford to cut , at least one or two items from each .
1	6B	each , uh -
1	6B	list .
2	6B	for instance , i do n't think it would be a good idea to cut toxic waste disposal .
1	6B	i feel that would end badly .
1	6B	alright , let 's go list by list . what about education programs ? what do you think we ca n't afford to cut , and what do you think we can maybe skip for a few years ?
1	6B	yes .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	i would agree with you on all of those .
1	6B	and , um -
1	6B	to that - uh -
1	6B	i trunc i think that the arts are so often on the chopping block that they probably do n't have any money to fall back on if we cut them . um -
1	6B	but -
1	6B	looking at the list , um - the immediate uh -
1	6B	easy potential cuts in education programs to my eye -
1	6B	appear to be the sugar free juice machines which are -
1	6B	uh , easily replaceable . and , uh , possibly the football equipment simply because -
1	6B	there 's already football equipment .
1	6B	could probably -
1	6B	hold on to it for a few years .
1	6B	and it 's - it 's something that it 's easy to get the community to fund .
0	6B	sugar free juice machines
1	6B	is there anything else we think we can safely cut off the , uh , educational programs list ?
0	6B	cooking classes .
1	6B	probably does n't require a class .
1	6B	um , so that 's - that 's three items there .
1	6B	we could cut three from each list without uh -
1	6B	yeah . or - or too much woe . um -
0	6B	safety , ooh -
1	6B	very tricky .
1	6B	um - i actually some time ago i worked for the city .
1	6B	and um -
1	6B	one of my bosses said something to me that - that stayed with me for a long time . he said -
1	6B	when we cut something we do n't choose the thing that will make the most people happy . we choose the thing that will make everyone equally unhappy .
1	6B	not , you know , unequally unhappy .
1	6B	um -
1	6B	so , i - looking at it i say what -
1	6B	what would - ?
2	6B	hurt the least in the short term ? i do n't think a lot of people will be hurt if we stop inspecting the bagel factory .
1	6B	it 's true . it 's true .
1	6B	it 's true .
1	6B	this is true , but looking at the other options - alright , um -
2	6B	weed control and invasive species removal appear to be the same thing . what if we cut the weed control , and just left the invasive species removal ?
2	6B	so , maybe there 's some dandelions in the parks , but they 're not getting overrun with some scotch broom or something .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	you 're right . that 's a capital project . that can be done , uh , later . of course if the hospital is overcrowded it becomes difficult , but - this is a difficult list .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	should certainly stay -
2	6B	absolutely .
2	6B	definitely important .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	neighborhood watch support . i would say it 's quite probably that if there is a neighborhood would they will be able to fund themselves for the -
2	6B	cuz there 's a strong social component to that , and it 's something a community can easily rally around .
0	6B	mm-hmm .
0	6B	right .
0	6B	right .
1	6B	right . that makes sense .
0	6B	weed control .
1	6B	we need to cut something . hospital additions . alright , so we 've got three -
1	6B	three cut from that list . okay .
0	6B	recreation and public services . well , let 's see what we 've got on the list .
0	6B	um -
0	6B	hmm .
2	6B	initially , i would say football stadium upkeep is -
2	6B	probably not as essential as -
2	6B	for example -
2	6B	uh , the food bank .
0	6B	um -
0	6B	mm-hmm .
0	6B	mm-hmm .
0	6B	mm-hmm . mm-hmm .
0	6B	mm-hmm .
0	6B	mm-hmm .
0	6B	mm-hmm .
1	6B	alright .
2	6B	we have dog catcher and pest control .
2	6B	we have stray cat spaying , and kitten and puppy adoption , and a veterinary hospital .
2	6B	it 's a lot of animal services . could we roll some of those into each other and -
1	6B	mm-hmm . mm-hmm .
0	6B	right .
1	6B	quite like
1	6B	quite likely , so -
0	6B	mm-hmm .
1	6B	mm-hmm . i think we could . -
1	6B	we could , uh , roll both stray cat spaying and kitten and puppy adoption into the veterinary hospital .
1	6B	without any -
1	6B	pinch -
0	6B	um -
1	6B	that 's a good point . that 's , um -
1	6B	a great commendable program , but -
1	6B	is it essential ? um , and - and - will in fact the community not step up to provide ?
1	6B	uh - support for that ? on their own . aha ! there it is ! um -
1	6B	uh , i think - i think you 're right . i think we can cut -
1	6B	cat spaying , puppy adoption , and the reusable bag campaign .
0	6B	alright , that 's three things .
0	6B	last one . alright .
1	6B	i think so . i think so .
1	6B	how would you feel about cutting taxi stops ?
1	6B	people flag them anyway , so -
1	6B	mm-hmm . mm-hmm .
1	6B	yes .
1	6B	or are they building it ?
1	6B	are they building it at the time .
0	6B	yes . do -
0	6B	right .
1	6B	yes . co-mayors , yes .
1	6B	do we have well , we 're - right now in - in this city we 're in the process of building one , but in this town do we have one ?
2	6B	um . oh , i think i see something better .
2	6B	i see flagpole repair .
2	6B	i - i think it will be - it will be easier for the city to recover from the loss of a few flagpoles than -
2	6B	from the absence sufficient public transit .
1	6B	myself as well .
0	6B	are you alright ?
0	6B	okay .
0	6B	oh .
0	6B	um -
0	6B	additional bus stops .
1	6B	uh , taxi stops . right , okay . sounds good .
2	6B	good recommendations . all done .
