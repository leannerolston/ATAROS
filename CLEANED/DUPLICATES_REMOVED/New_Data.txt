2	3I	yeah , cuz what else were we gon na put on that side ? just lots of the food items ? we do n't have all that much food .
1	3I	-
1	6B	okay , so drama coaches . so would you keep a drama coach ?
1	6B	yeah . yeah . right . yeah .
1	3I	oh yes i think s-
1	3I	water bottles , kinda - ?
1	3I	maybe trunc next to power cords .
0	6B	i think it 's like -
2	3I	i 'll just put it here . well , i guess there 's face cream , so -
2	6B	yeah i 'd look out and say find me a public law that says i have to fly the flag .
0	6B	basketball club and junior soccer league .
1	3I	trunc do we wan na put drinks up here ?
1	3I	oh yeah . okay .
1	3I	like , next to ice cream , yep .
1	3I	yeah , it 's kinda stuck .
1	3I	bottles of juice ? down here ?
1	6B	so , trunc potentially trunc additional bus stops and tattoo artist licenses .
1	6B	well let 's keep it for now , in case it 's important .
2	6B	oh , football equipment .
1	3I	yeah , that looks like a good choice to me .
2	3I	well , let 's look at this for a second .
1	3I	fishing net , fish hooks , and wetsuits .
0	6B	what are - ? what are those ?
2	3I	maybe here for right now ? i think - although you 're right . you 'd definitely use a bucket on a boat .
1	6B	yeah right .
1	6B	yeah right .
1	6B	yeah right .
1	3I	so , we 're gon na assume that .
1	3I	by the beets and soybeans .
1	6B	killing the stadium trunc keep to add a girls , but anyway -
2	6B	hospital additions . if you need it you need it .
0	6B	uh , the cooking classes are gone .
2	6B	and there are plenty of kids who maybe would n't have access to that . but they could still play soccer on the street with their friends . like -
1	6B	i dunno , we 'll leave it for now . pre-natal check-ups .
1	3I	maybe we 'll stick it there .
1	6B	so we count sex ed -
0	6B	that 's three .
0	6B	that 's three .
1	3I	we could put it across from the tweezers .
1	6B	precisely .
2	3I	just pick one at a time .
1	3I	for ease of access to both departments .
2	6B	yeah . um , do we wan na do one from each category ? you wan na do one from each and then -
1	3I	here , i 'm just gon na take this -
1	6B	potentially we could trunc cut it .
1	3I	yeah , over here in the -
0	3I	go and grab a couple more .
1	6B	i do n't know . let 's see what else we can cut .
1	6B	yeah , i trunc trunc feeling it would be in trunc the back of something , like a - like a stranger , or something like that ?
1	3I	where 's - where was that - ? oh , here . axes and things and -
1	3I	maybe we could do multiple .
2	6B	yes please . yes please . um . speed limit signs .
2	6B	do n't take the kittens ! no !
2	6B	it 's a lotta money .
0	6B	note-takers , disability -
1	6B	trunc oh , that 's -
1	6B	st spaying um no .
1	6B	soccer .
1	3I	could be trunc here .
2	6B	it 's a lesser than a - er - special ed teacher and uh - i think note takers for disability services are very important . and music teachers i think are important
1	6B	like , in your head . i do n't know .
1	3I	would that be more of a sport thing or more of up with the refrigerator magnets ? this would be , like -
2	6B	yeah i think my first thing to do would be to cut the stadium upkeep .
2	3I	so , what do you think ? buckets over with - ?
1	6B	yeah . - yeah . let 's get rid of the speed limits .
1	3I	if there 's a test , we 'll explain our thinking .
2	6B	fishing licenses , i think are fine .
1	3I	i think there were a lot of -
1	6B	i 'm wondering if we need hospital additions . that 'd be a big budget cut .
2	3I	trunc the dried figs would be with all the baking stuff , yeah .
1	6B	cooking classes , yeah .
1	6B	i 'm not sure about that one .
0	6B	you know , then on your - do you have cable t_v_ ?
1	3I	why not ?
1	6B	why not ?
2	6B	i feel like - but i feel like advertisements bring you money , so -
1	6B	and maybe , um .
1	6B	trunc yeah got ta keep stuff clean . um . speech therapy .
1	3I	so it 'd either be a housewares item , or -
1	6B	i do n't think we need a public news station .
2	6B	um . depends on what it is . if we say okay the football equipment is just to upgrade the stuff they already have and the stuff is pretty darn good .
1	6B	education and trunc math tutors .
1	6B	i think they do a bunch of stuff that -
1	6B	okay . alright .
1	3I	okay . alright .
1	3I	would sticks of butter then go with the sugar ?
1	6B	my public bus upkeep has to be done to keep up the busses . that was very um .
2	6B	and cancelling trunc s_t_d_ education .
0	6B	soccer league .
0	6B	soccer league .
0	6B	is - then that 's three so - okay . and then , for the last one
1	3I	the siding or the power cords .
2	6B	we do n't want to be - wallowing in our own toxic waste .
1	3I	yep perfect .
0	3I	alrighty .
0	6B	alrighty .
1	3I	for the empty buckets we do n't have .
1	6B	junior trunc oh , and the boys basketball club -
2	3I	that 's where we 'd stick that . th-
1	6B	uh-huh , yes . housing assistance ? yes .
2	3I	can we trunc can we put them on the ends ?
1	3I	okay , with the boating items . huh !
2	3I	shoelaces ? put it underneath socks .
2	3I	um . we should . yeah . um .
1	3I	that 's right there with scissors .
0	6B	what what ?
0	6B	let 's keep that in mind and then we 'll see . we may have to . yeah .
0	3I	do we have trunc clothing items yet , we do n't have clothing items , do we ?
1	6B	right right . well , for right now we could leave it on there and just see .
0	6B	i did n't see it .
1	3I	oh , hard goods . yeah .
0	3I	yeah , chocolate bars .
1	6B	mm . well , i 'm thinking -
1	3I	i will actually put it before the siding .
1	3I	whole buncha drinking while you -
2	6B	oh wait til we get to public safety .
1	3I	kitchen . it 's a kitchen item , too . how bout here ? those are all practical .
1	3I	mm-hm . uh , let 's see .
2	6B	punishing people for parking in the wrong spot , but what if you have , like a broken down car in downtown forever ? you wan na get that outta there .
1	3I	face cream . next to tweezers .
0	3I	is that what it is ? oh .
2	3I	hm . or maybe i 'll just put it here , next to th-
0	6B	okay so those are our seven .
2	3I	we - much better !
1	3I	the power cords here .
2	6B	hmm . well would trunc depend - depend on a lot of things .
2	6B	i think it 's important . coming from someone that 's taken environmental classes . like , i dunno . i would n't take that away . mm .
1	3I	that 's true , yeah . let 's keep it on the end . let 's just keep it on the end . yeah .
1	3I	maybe right here .
1	3I	maybe right here ?
2	6B	it seems weird to me that the same county that has a subway would also have -
0	3I	he ate , um - what 's the russian dish ?
1	6B	yeah , i do n't know enough about that one to really - massage certificates .
2	3I	that 's a trunc that 's - that 's - that 's for - actually , is n't that , uh , more like picnic ?
0	3I	uh , no , not yet .
1	6B	cooking classes - i feel like you could cut , too . you do n't really - generally do n't have that .
2	6B	i do n't know , that 's why it can be cut !
1	3I	so yeah , maybe h-
1	3I	desk chairs above cook stoves .
1	3I	this sort of a thing . do - should i fill in this spot up here ?
1	3I	paper , there we go .
1	3I	maybe next to travel guides ? cuz , you need -
2	6B	we need that , do n't we ? yeah ?
2	3I	probably around here . tubing 's all alone .
2	3I	and i 'm gon na go below books of matches if that 's okay .
1	3I	yeah , with the fleece lined boots .
1	6B	if they wanted to know okay how , what should i do , buh buh buh , who do they go to .
1	3I	how bout scissors ? those go with -
1	3I	yep . so -
1	3I	yeah . yeah . that 's a good idea .
2	6B	criminal history on your -
1	3I	produce .
2	3I	thick - or we could put thick sweaters over with camping , when we get to camping .
2	3I	oh , i see . household . okay .
1	3I	i think so i think so . i do n't think that 's -
2	3I	would you also say with scissors ? like with other - ?
0	3I	could n't yeah like - hm .
1	6B	yeah , but if you - specially in washington , i feel like that 's kind of important .
1	6B	definitely . okay . so we 're cutting -
1	3I	i 'll put it across from the cake mix .
2	6B	hm , again , the community news ads are nice , but i can - they can get their news from the radio . from other sources .
2	6B	uh , who - i do n't know if i 've ever met that ca n't take notes . well , i dunno . like ca n't you just have a friend do it ? i dunno . you can just -
2	6B	yeah , but then they 're - all things being equal .
1	3I	um . do you wan na put it by -
2	3I	i 'm thinking maybe more with the soybeans . things that are not fresh foods . they 're packaged in some way that are not open .
2	6B	yeah , that 's it . uh , yeah . but i think it 's uh , you know , basically it 's - it 's one of those things where if we do n't have it it 's not going to really affect the public health and safety immediately .
1	3I	and these are books and loose leaf . yeah .
1	3I	oh . cook stove . that goes - see this is like camping stuff , right ? camping-ish
1	6B	but if we keep them up , they can still use the public facilities .
0	3I	back packs .
2	6B	oh , yeah , weed control . that 's right . yeah , that one .
1	6B	and they talk to you about reproduction , and stuff . they 're like - they 're like the trunc the - they 're the like the poor man 's trunc planned parenthood .
1	6B	i think we should probably keep it .
0	3I	oh , sorry .
0	3I	mm hats .
1	6B	feeling - yeah . especially -
1	6B	so , the junior soccer league maybe .
1	3I	picnic supplies and stuff .
1	6B	well , i think maybe s_t_d_ education .
2	6B	i do n't understand why you need a neighborhood watch support .
2	3I	i think like , somewhere up here . i do n't think there 's that many toys and stuff , so i think we should put it near there .
1	3I	that give us more room for overflow .
1	3I	i do n't care .
0	6B	note takers , maybe we 'll leave that in for right now . uh , sugar free juice machines , bookkeeping classes , and music teachers . so we 've got nine things we 're cutting .
2	6B	paid for with -
1	6B	so we keep that in ?
1	3I	okay . we 'll have there -
1	6B	egg farm regulations . well , neighborhood watch support , i 'm afraid they 've cut that already .
2	3I	sure . maybe put it just a little bit closer to toilet paper ?
1	6B	so the access station , but not the news station , that stay . reusable bag campaign , probably not as important . veterinary hospital .
1	3I	for the - yeah .
1	6B	trunc get rid of more .
1	3I	could be .
1	6B	and teaching certificates .
1	3I	hm , maybe by the cake mix ? i do n't kno-
2	6B	so , maybe not there . um , speed limit signs . yeah definitely . additional bus stops .
2	6B	i think two from each is a good -
2	6B	conference rooms , you got ta lead a trunc leave a conference room clean . you trunc you leave a stadium clean ?
3	3I	all the clothing is in one area .
2	6B	uh . just - turn on food network .
2	6B	why did we choose five ! ? okay but - let 's see .
2	3I	oh , but ice cream 's up there . oh well .
1	3I	yeah , that 's true . let 's - let 's do it here , then .
2	6B	maybe a maybe , for now .
1	3I	packages of cookies . ooh ! a pre-processed food .
1	6B	we 're leaving in job training .
1	3I	or for camping . is that it ?
1	3I	and the books of matches , they could go with -
2	6B	trunc it does n't belong in the same budget as all these operating , on going expense -
2	6B	trunc yeah , we - okay , so we - we did n't make that choice .
2	3I	kids backpacks with the kids toys , and kids books . that 's perfect !
2	6B	licensing is important cuz you do n't want -
0	6B	really ? wow .
1	3I	yeah . by the stove .
0	6B	they did - mm-hm .
2	6B	i do n't know . um . i think it 's important to stay active , but - oh , kitten puppy adoption .
2	6B	do - does the government seriously like fund that ? like what - ?
1	6B	they were all trunc additional bus stops . we were -
1	6B	those are gon na pay for themselves , actually . you do n't have to worry about that .
2	3I	do we want it up close to the ice cream ?
2	3I	hey , there you go . light jackets , right next to the boots .
2	6B	i trunc no , i trunc i think i know what it - i mean i think i 'm right . i think public news station is something like those stations i just was laying out .
0	6B	that 's - that 's government regulating . who 's hunting and when .
1	6B	i would agree with you on all of those .
1	3I	okay , let 's put it - yeah .
2	6B	not necessarily fund , so -
2	6B	of course i 'll speech therapy .
1	3I	sure . put it by the bundle of sticks .
1	3I	right near the soybeans .
1	3I	right near the soybeans .
2	6B	they can fundraise . so that can get the axe .
1	6B	i would kinda cut it , but -
1	3I	yeah , food . that 's food . yeah . okay .
1	6B	mm , the acting coaches we thought were maybe optional .
2	6B	i think it 's nice .
1	6B	trunc it seems like , uh - a little extra too like , some of the like hospital additions and toxic waste trunc waste disposal seem pretty straight forward , but -
1	3I	let 's do that .
1	3I	let 's do that .
1	3I	sure ! it 'll be our catchall .
1	3I	down vest .
1	6B	soup kitchens ? yes .
1	3I	by the ice cream , or - ?
1	6B	i think i 'd leave that for the library .
2	6B	i dunno , these ones are kind of hard to pick because a lot of these are important in my opinion .
1	3I	are you comfortable with this - ?
2	3I	i wonder , five pound - maybe up here ?
1	6B	trunc mm-kay . so we have - that might be one we wan na cut .
1	6B	i think so too , take care of - take care of okay , so there 's four . egg farm regulations .
1	3I	so fishing net with the fish hooks .
2	3I	ooh . trunc we have this too , though .
1	3I	paper bags should go - one of the empty ones . yeah .
0	6B	uh , like a lodge where you could go get your information .
2	6B	those machines , none the less , are actually profit makers -
1	3I	well , maybe we should - maybe - we need something over here .
2	6B	actually , we 'd save a lot more money getting rid of football .
1	6B	oh , yeah , that 's true .
1	6B	but , there again , it 's a -
2	6B	towing services should be privatized .
2	3I	unless you wan na put camping trunc kinda gear there .
2	6B	public drainage ditches , we need .
2	3I	an - naw . i think it goes on that .
1	6B	does n't that kinda go with cat spaying ? i mean not that cats are pets cuz they 're not , but -
0	6B	massage .
0	6B	so - so , we could add back - let 's see we - so we had nine things that we cut , so we could add back three .
1	6B	i think so , too . cooking classes ?
2	6B	i know , but i mean - we - we wan na spay stray cats .
1	6B	let 's see , i think - what would be the single most important thing ? the math tutors ?
1	6B	first ? do you think ?
2	3I	oh no .
2	6B	oh no !
2	3I	oh no !
2	3I	oh no !
1	3I	, works for me .
0	6B	massage certificates ?
1	3I	it seems too - cases of whiskey , category in itself . maybe we should just put it over there , do you think ? or trunc what do you think ?
1	6B	and get rid of the news ads .
0	3I	kay , go ahead .
0	3I	kay . bags of peat moss .
0	6B	um . assistant cooks .
1	3I	kind of like -
1	6B	like , basic cable free anyway ?
2	6B	yeah , there 's a lot of overlap here .
2	6B	and the most important one to keep , i think , are the teaching certificates .
1	3I	how bout -
2	3I	sharp and potentially deadly things .
0	6B	book keeping as in like filing stuff ? and - ?
2	6B	sex offender database . needle exchange , really important for public health . and the inspections are important .
1	3I	maybe across from the toys , sort of ? well , cuz they had -
1	3I	that 's fine with me .
0	6B	five .
1	3I	right here . sure .
1	6B	alright . trunc poetry books or cooking classes ?
2	6B	yeah , soccer . yeah .
1	3I	oh , yeah yeah yeah . here ?
1	6B	i do n't think so . i do n't think so . and then , what the hell is sugar free juice ? i 'd trunc i mean frankly i mean soda pop is one thing -
0	3I	um , bundles of sticks .
1	3I	yeah , i think it 's householdy stuff .
1	3I	uh well , maybe in the kitchen with the egg timer ?
2	6B	well - i 'm gon na assume that we 're - in the perfect society that has now adopted the reusable bag campaign .
1	6B	i would cut a lot of - yeah , here .
1	3I	by the jugs or something ?
1	3I	that 's right .
1	6B	that 's right .
1	6B	that 's right .
1	6B	that 's right .
1	6B	that 's right .
1	6B	that 's right .
1	3I	that 's right .
2	6B	um . and - yeah . those are state funded anyways , not county .
2	6B	cuz i 'm thinking that like , a - a city that is big enough to have that like , level of infrastructure , like taxis , and uh , subway and buses ,
1	3I	and tow ropes , probably with heavy cable and buckets , and -
2	3I	and we might just hafta put that around the pet food . we do n't have a good way to organize .
1	3I	toys ?
1	6B	building , and the same - you know , you just go there . you get one -
1	6B	well that could be trunc well .
1	6B	three cut from that list . okay .
1	3I	and it looks like this is already set up for , like , home supplies .
1	6B	no , i 'm just sorta reading through the list here . s_t_d_s - trunc i -
2	6B	acting coaches . yeah .
1	3I	fishing hat ?
1	3I	okay , loose-leaf paper .
1	3I	looks - sure . yeah .
1	6B	do we need additional bus stops ?
2	3I	sure , that works for me .
2	6B	yeah , i think s_t_d_ - trunc is more important to stress -
2	3I	yum !
2	3I	yum .
1	3I	yeah . got ta keep warm while you 're cooking .
1	3I	i kinda wan na put it right in the middle .
1	3I	by the books of matches or the boating supplies ?
2	3I	put it in th-
1	3I	yeah , it depends .
1	3I	so let 's put the fresh stuff on this side . okay .
1	3I	this could actually go with outdoorsy stuff too ,
1	6B	the trunc taxi stops -
1	3I	um , so i 'll let you take the lead on this , since apparently you 've worked groceries .
2	3I	oh that goes by boating supplies .
2	3I	oh really ? that 's funny . yeah , we can put that there .
2	3I	well , we 're pretty low in the food department .
0	6B	three , three for that .
2	6B	we do n't need additional ones . we just need the ones that we already have . to keep them .
1	3I	maybe yeah , with the duct tape .
2	6B	the thing is , we had county funds , but they were from bonds that had been sold way a long time ago .
1	6B	yeah , you need that .
1	6B	okay . that sounds good .
1	3I	okay . that sounds good .
1	3I	going outside .
2	3I	maybe that could also be with like , school supplies . may like , refrigerator trunc well toys kind of , are usually near the -
2	6B	i think stray cat spaying 's more important .
1	3I	i see tow ropes . it could either be boating type fun type trunc i mean i think it should be up by boating supplies , because it certainly would n't be a power cord .
0	3I	loose-leaf paper .
0	3I	loose-leaf paper .
0	3I	loose-leaf paper .
0	3I	loose-leaf paper .
0	3I	loose-leaf paper .
0	3I	loose-leaf paper .
2	6B	i say remove reproductive education . and we 'll call it sex ed under the education .
1	3I	heavy coats , light i do n't really care about order , do you have a preference ? seems like outerwear .
0	6B	public bus upkeep and drainage ditches .
0	6B	uh boating licenses -
3	3I	um , how bout next to the packages of cookies , yes !
2	3I	cuz pet food was there . we could n't have moved that into food .
2	3I	i trunc i think so , cuz it looks like there 's a lot in there , and i do n't think we could fit them on -
2	3I	yeah uh , good thing , too .
2	3I	yeah , children 's books .
1	6B	yeah . and i think we could go back if we wanted to and get rid of right there . okay .
1	3I	so , outdoor - okay .
2	6B	oh trunc how bout we just put it in .
2	6B	and stupid .
1	6B	soccer league is nice , but -
0	3I	small axes ?
0	3I	small axes .
0	3I	small axes .
0	3I	small axes .
0	3I	small axes .
0	3I	small axes .
0	3I	small axes .
0	3I	small axes .
0	3I	small axes .
0	3I	small axes .
0	3I	small axes .
0	3I	small axes .
1	3I	i know , i 'm thinking of the end of the aisle . down here .
1	6B	public health requires egg farm regulations . weed control . what 's the difference between - ?
0	6B	uh , the other one was , uh , reproductive education .
1	3I	mm . gosh maybe trunc here ?
1	3I	that 's an easy one .
1	6B	i agree . um , they -
1	3I	mm-kay . good idea . cuz we 'll probably have more clothing items .
2	6B	oh , there it is . upkeep . but see , the stadium 's there , but that - it 's the upkeep .
2	3I	yeah , i dunno . i f-
1	3I	either one . camping .
0	3I	any , um -
1	3I	so , that should go -
1	6B	to one of these other trunc trunc if we only have to take two out of this list , what are the two ?
1	3I	where should we put - ?
2	6B	well , i 'm a librarian , my kids did too .
2	6B	towing services , um the government should n't be paying for towing services .
2	6B	that 's kinda borderline .
0	6B	hunting tags , towing services , massage certificates , flag pole repair .
2	3I	yeah yeah . trunc and i trunc unless you object i 'll put that too okay .
0	3I	electric -
0	3I	oh , here 's the power cords and the -
1	3I	incidentals , excellent point .
1	3I	here , or - right .
2	6B	i say we cut it , just to be -
0	6B	and we already had gotten six things from each there .
1	3I	put it with the - with the clothing . right
0	3I	loose leaf paper .
0	3I	loose leaf paper .
0	3I	loose leaf paper .
0	3I	loose leaf paper .
0	3I	loose leaf paper .
1	3I	um , liters of water , maybe here ?
2	6B	oh , it was education and programs . that one was hard to cut any more than two .
2	6B	maintained -
0	6B	that could be .
1	3I	mint toothpaste next to toilet paper ? that 's , like , toiletries .
2	3I	trunc oh new column .
0	6B	under toxic waste disposal .
2	3I	because they 're both baking ingredients .
3	3I	oh but eggs ! well , uh , heck yes . gosh . that was an obvious one that i missed .
2	6B	sorry . i 'm not a fan of poetry but i do n't wan na take poetry away from the child that might be interested in it . assuming it 's for children .
1	3I	and then sticks of butter .
2	6B	also , i can - i can see getting rid of the notetakers . not that i wan na leave out those who are disabled , but i 'm thinking they can just have a student next to them photocopy their notes -
2	3I	away from the toy section .
2	6B	or traffic alerts , or -
1	6B	okay . yeah , no . and then keep pest control .
0	3I	m-
1	3I	yeah , that sounds reasonable .
1	3I	alright , some big heavy duty utility scissors .
2	6B	trunc uh - is - is - i mean , trunc that 's okay compared to removing some of these other things . i mean , it 's really - yeah .
1	3I	um , just move it up to provide space ? okay cuz i - yeah .
2	6B	stray cat spaying . keep it , otherwise the cat population just explodes .
0	3I	mint tooth paste .
1	3I	just put the coats right next to them ?
0	3I	mm , okay .
0	3I	mm , okay .
1	3I	looks like we needs a - an apparel section .
0	6B	we just have to be the - do the same number , yeah .
1	6B	yeah , we could do that .
1	6B	within the community .
1	6B	yeah , that 's what i 'm looking at too .
2	6B	i mean , keeping your hospitals up is nice , but - feel like there 's too much we do n't know . like , is our hospital old and sagging , or - ? i trunc
1	3I	pre-cut wood . let 's put down here with the -
1	3I	yeah , that sounds -
1	6B	oh yeah . okay there you go .
1	3I	right exactly .
1	6B	yeah , but for music stuff , you need like , private lessons .
1	6B	then , that just keeps it easy , and even .
1	3I	yeah , we can do drinks there .
2	3I	oh yeah ! we could do that . yeah .
2	3I	or we could have buckets for those people who need to bail out their sinking -
1	3I	okay , i - maybe -
1	6B	uh , does it really belong under there ?
0	6B	uh , s_t_d_ education .
1	3I	yeah , yeah - oh , there 's not that much , so -
2	3I	no , it should go at the top or the bottom , probably .
1	3I	here . here .
1	3I	thick sweaters probably go over here .
1	3I	there 's just lots of empty aisles .
2	6B	had kids or something . but i -
1	6B	i think i 'd keep that maybe .
0	6B	the sugar free juice machines it looks like .
1	3I	yeah . that works . books in between the loose-leaf paper and the travel guides ?
1	6B	there 's a question of reproductive education , s_t_d_ education -
1	6B	um , music teachers , i - i would say that 's important to keep . yeah . okay , check .
0	3I	and hats .
2	6B	see , like , soup kitchens i think are great , but -
1	3I	we can make , like , a clothing kind of spot .
1	6B	okay , so the sugar free juice definitely gone . okay .
2	3I	items .
2	6B	trunc put a new tab on your car .
2	3I	gas-powered cookstoves ? i 'd put it with the pre-cut wood .
1	3I	put it somewhere where -
1	6B	oh . it - yeah , we could do that .
1	6B	oh that 's good . well we did stir-fry and something else but um -
1	3I	not exactly a trunc food group , huh ?
1	6B	well , i do n't know what an acting coach -
1	3I	um , those - that 's -
1	3I	it looks like we have -
1	3I	yeah yeah right .
0	6B	veterinary hospital , football stadium upkeep , and pest control .
1	3I	or toys ?
1	3I	backpacks . shoot .
1	3I	where should we stick it ?
2	3I	yes . maybe on this side ? okay .
0	3I	peat moss . do we have any - ?
1	3I	oh , that could go by box knives , though !
1	6B	is n't it , um - ?
0	3I	desert items .
1	3I	or across ?
1	6B	i think the taxi stops is -
2	3I	i think trunc doughnuts will be -
0	6B	they take pets to the pound .
1	6B	i guess we hafta keep all of it , do n't we ? just to be safe .
1	3I	we 're all in agreement on that .
0	6B	state of washington channel .
1	6B	i think on education , for me , it would be either -
0	6B	bookkeeping classes and music teachers .
0	6B	um public access trunc is that like -
1	3I	next to the buckets ?
2	6B	let 's get rid of that .
2	3I	well , ice cream is in frozen food , so -
1	3I	i mean , they could be like -
1	3I	that 's what i think .
1	6B	yeah , if we 're just getting rid of one i would say , um -
2	6B	well , maybe it 's rats .
2	6B	yeah , right . they 've just , they 've got a big one . yeah . well , it means , yeah , it means they have to go to private sources instead of government .
2	6B	i 'd let the public access station go . it 's got ta cost more than the community news .
2	6B	yeah . that would be easy for me to cut .
0	6B	needle exchange . what does that mean ?
2	6B	yeah , i - yeah . we hafta -
0	3I	oh , except travel guides . that was down in
1	3I	that makes these guys kinda weirdos -
0	6B	um . hm .
0	3I	um , hm .
0	6B	um . hm .
2	3I	the mint toothpaste . and then below the mint toothpaste the bars of soap -
1	6B	okay . let 's start with recreation program . trunc and public service list .
0	6B	those are signs .
2	3I	um , maybe up here ?
1	3I	oh ! oh , oh , okay sure .
2	6B	somehow think that 's a smaller niche than -
1	6B	oh , that 's three .
2	3I	or , maybe -
2	6B	oh , somebody would .
0	3I	i think we put those there .
2	3I	half-inch tubing . that sounds hardware-ish .
1	6B	uh , these two ?
1	6B	although , massage certificates sounds to mean it does n't say license .
2	3I	wait , with water . um .
1	3I	liters of water . that sounds -
1	3I	you can put your bait in it , i guess .
1	6B	so , what are we gon na do - ?
1	6B	is probably multi-jurisdictional .
0	6B	uh , let 's see what else .
1	3I	very good .
1	6B	totally know what that is .
0	6B	are there - ?
1	3I	uh , face cream would be - yeah .
1	6B	but i feel like we could get a volunteer or and intern -
2	6B	weed control trunc uh , since invasive species is going to be -
0	6B	poetry books . trunc special ed teachers . cooking classes .
0	3I	the other -
1	3I	pre-cut wood would go -
2	6B	because i do n't really trunc see a need to have any type of -
1	3I	what if we put them -
1	3I	yeah , th-
2	3I	containers or with - ?
0	3I	going wild and crazy .
2	6B	initially , i would say football stadium upkeep is -
1	6B	education programs . so we 're starting with education first .
2	6B	uh . gosh .
0	3I	there was something was the -
1	3I	oh , okay . siding .
1	3I	maybe next to the doughnuts ?
2	6B	you 're right . that 's a capital project . that can be done , uh , later . of course if the hospital is overcrowded it becomes difficult , but - this is a difficult list .
0	6B	uh , custodians , the football equipment , the acting coaches , the poetry books , the cooking classes -
2	3I	uh , i do n't know if we 're gon na make it . ooh ! here 's the water -
2	6B	well , i do n't know . what is that ?
2	3I	ca n't - do that though because the - eggs are stuck .
1	3I	travel guides . sure , why not .
1	6B	we need those . yeah . i think that 's useful .
2	6B	teaching certificates speed limit signs , additional bus stops , tattoo artist licenses , that 's going away .
0	3I	boating , siding -
1	3I	and it feels like the camping outdoor ware section would be looking for something more durable than paper .
2	3I	oh yeah . all that 's just kind of weird - things .
1	6B	we 've done it . i think we 're done .
2	3I	well , first of all let 's look at what 's - what we got ta work wi-
1	3I	uh , has to be down here by buckets and things like that , right ?
2	6B	oh yeah , that 's true still would need the puppy adoptions though .
1	3I	yeah , go over here .
0	6B	was it ? yeah , the weed control .
2	6B	because i think that -
0	6B	so , is there anything there that you can just easily remove ?
1	3I	oh yeah . are you gon na - ?
1	6B	those are big things . trunc hospital and veterans .
0	3I	let 's see . uh , gas-powered cookstove .
1	3I	bars of soap . okay , rolls of duct tape .
2	6B	yeah the sugar free book - sugar free juice machines do n't really seem like a huge priority here .
1	3I	then the mint toothpaste .
2	3I	i think that 's a little better .
2	3I	not that you can do much with it . and then the sticks .
2	6B	it 's very dependant on , like -
2	3I	should be near some sorta - i do n't know . maybe it should be back in the back .
1	6B	we 're leaving in music , and we 're leaving in poetry .
1	3I	okay . pull one out .
2	3I	we made fun of their organization , but i do n't know that we 're doing any better . books by travel guides ?
2	3I	well , we kinda used up our bathroom space . i wonder if we could just -
2	3I	and uh wet suits is with boating .
0	6B	twelve .
2	3I	um . and i wo n't shove it in the middle of the aisle . um . i 'll just put those underneath buckets .
1	3I	ingredients versus or - or ingredients versus already made . yeah .
1	3I	uh , where was - where 's our clothing ?
0	3I	i do n't remember .
0	3I	i do n't remember .
2	3I	i do n't either . but i feel like it kinda would go -
2	6B	yeah , you go trunc go the library ! go to the library !
1	6B	than the basketball club .
0	3I	i - gas powered cook stoves .
1	6B	and then maybe come up with , like -
2	6B	community news ads . i hate ads . so . well , if it - unless -
2	3I	face cream i 'm gon na go ahead and put above the toilet paper .
1	6B	the same thing , yeah . yes . housing assistance , yes .
1	6B	yeah i agree with the taxi stops .
1	6B	but i 'm trunc i just - i guess i do n't quite understand how they work . whether - if you cut that , what would happen ? whether it - whether people would like have a harder time getting licenses , or would have to go through someone else , or -
1	6B	the , uh , the alumni will pay for it .
1	3I	oh , we ca n't -
0	6B	now -
2	6B	i still have my eye on that community news ads .
1	6B	i could be wrong , though .
0	6B	towing services ?
0	6B	towing services .
0	6B	that 's like -
2	6B	whatever . yeah ! potholes . that 's important . um . subway system .
0	6B	needle exchange , sex offender database , veteran 's medical assistance , prenatal check-ups , and neighborhood watch support . i -
2	3I	so are mouse traps .
1	3I	bathroom ?
2	3I	close enough .
1	3I	yeah , with the other vegetables . pre-cut wood would probably go with the - because we have bundles of sticks out there .
2	6B	if it 's - means -
0	6B	yeah , i 'm not sure . or if it 's just within the schools ?
1	3I	these are more tools .
1	3I	yeah perhaps near the eggs . ma-
1	3I	up by toys ?
1	3I	the refrigerated section .
1	6B	yeah , that was trunc under , okay .
2	6B	abandoned car -
2	6B	had a public access station , that -
1	6B	and how many sex offenders are there , really ?
1	6B	we just have to .
2	3I	mint toothpaste , that 's easy .
1	3I	trunc bundles of sticks , maybe by the siding ?
0	6B	bookkeeping classes .
0	6B	bookkeeping classes ?
0	6B	bookkeeping classes .
0	6B	bookkeeping classes .
0	6B	bookkeeping classes .
0	6B	bookkeeping classes .
0	6B	bookkeeping classes .
1	6B	pretty much -
1	6B	pretty much -
1	3I	looks good .
1	3I	looks good ?
1	3I	yeah . i ca n't see where it would go better .
1	6B	i know how bad bussing is .
1	3I	i think two .
0	6B	bookkeeping .
0	6B	bookkeeping .
1	3I	let 's just call it - what , uh - where do you want it , here ?
0	6B	stray cat spaying .
0	6B	stray cat spaying ?
0	6B	alright . i think we 've solved all the problems for the -
1	3I	shoelaces . oh , are we gon na run into clothes ?
2	3I	water , juice , whiskey .
1	6B	caring for children .
1	3I	do n't make any sense .
2	6B	junior soccer , because that 's less expensive .
2	3I	probably in the same supplies , right ? with power cords ?
2	6B	okay , it 's legal to have what , an ounce of marijuana on you right ? whatever it is .
2	3I	just in case we find something else fishing , wan na put it right here ?
1	6B	i guess it 's education when they find them .
0	3I	uh , fishing net .
2	6B	financial thing so we - we should probably keep that .
2	6B	except it 's in public health and safety .
2	6B	alright . wow , we 're very fiscally conservative .
2	3I	next to bottles of juice !
2	3I	well , i guess it could go , like under tow -
0	3I	tweezers . alright .
1	6B	so then assistant cooks . assistant cooks .
0	3I	we have mousetraps and pet food all by themselves , but that 's - that 's good , they can just stay there .
2	3I	loose-leaf paper , i even know what that is .
2	6B	trunc infrastructure and licensing . okay , this 'll be trunc that 's is kind of important . um , speed limit signs ! i think that 's a no-brainer ! um , this road is sixty now . um -
2	3I	well maybe with the mouse traps , that 's one of those - and we 've got more utility here cuz rolls of ducks -
1	3I	might need an ax . shoelaces . too bad we do n't have shoes , cuz then we would put them next to them . but i think - were we doing - ? here ?
1	3I	this store 's heavy into camping .
1	6B	cool . i 'd be down for cutting it .
2	6B	food bank ? yes .
2	6B	i really want the teaching certificates cuz we - we want good education infrastructure .
1	3I	thick sweaters by heavy coats .
2	3I	a package of cookies . now we hafta - i think it goes with the ice cream . totally good .
0	6B	uh , invasive spe-
1	3I	sticks ? yeah , yeah .
1	3I	here . looks like pfft yeah .
2	6B	i would hate to think that they 're unlicensed , and their - their equipment is - is not - not hygienic . um , so , how bout - ? yeah , massage certificates .
1	3I	we do , huh ? well , let 's put it at the top , up there .
1	3I	we 'll put it with the other hardware trunc oops . oh no ! oh boy . clean up ! clean up on aisle trunc okay . yeah , that 's true .
1	3I	yeah , i think it 's hardware-ish .
0	3I	right there . you were just - it 's right - right above your hand , there yeah , keep going . there you go .
0	6B	um . so -
2	6B	sugar-free juice machines hafta go .
1	6B	uh , trunc juice machines .
1	3I	i like how we were talking about , uh wanting to reorganize it .
2	3I	oh no ! thick sweaters .
1	6B	we probably do n't need to do that either .
1	3I	we do n't really have , like , a gardening -
2	6B	acting , poetry , special ed teachers . we hafta have those . cooking classes ?
2	3I	oh , perfect .
0	6B	special ed teachers , cooking classes , notetakers , disability services -
0	3I	um , egg timers .
1	6B	alright , so let 's do football , and keep the poetry .
1	3I	yeah . yep .
2	6B	you tell people that they have to have it out . you have to cut it out .
1	6B	and reusable bags .
1	3I	oh ! travel . right . okay , that sounds good .
1	3I	and the socks and trunc right . mm-hmm .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
1	6B	you 're low income , you go to public health clinic , and they help you with birth control -
0	6B	i - yeah , i wonder if it 's like for the cafeteria or something like that . and then .
2	3I	i 've got some heavy coats next . so those 'll go up with the - up with the clothing aisle . so near to the hats and shoe laces on the other side of the aisle from the travel guides .
2	3I	maybe with trunc bundles of sticks ? feel like -
2	6B	i mean , we 're assuming that each one of em has the same monetary value , which is hardly the fact , but that 's okay . okay . so on to recreation and public services .
1	6B	yeah , i do n't think weed control is high priority . uh , neighborhood watch support , i think i 'd probably let them manage that themselves .
1	6B	is it . we 've just had a big scandal . right .
0	3I	and , chocolate bars .
0	3I	loose leaf paper . alright , um -
1	3I	cake mix . yeah . okay .
0	3I	got face cream .
1	6B	maybe neither of those .
1	3I	up ? okay , let 's do that .
0	6B	oh , there is public access station versus public news station .
1	3I	maybe put those above the sugar . that sounds like a good idea .
1	6B	yeah , i 'm for that . kill the taxi stops .
1	3I	household supplies ? large cups up there , somewhere around there i suppose , maybe .
1	6B	yeah . um i mean i trunc i prefer soccer over football , so i would prefer to keep the junior soccer league over the football stadium .
1	3I	well in that case -
0	3I	sorry , i grabbed a lot . bagels .
1	3I	do you want all the food first ? the easy seems like - easiest -
2	6B	it 's not gon na save a nickel .
0	3I	matches ?
3	6B	i 'm furious ! i do n't want to do this . ah .
1	6B	i do n't know question - question mark , like , on that one . um -
1	6B	alright . five seems like a good -
1	3I	eggs . sticks of butter next to eggs .
1	3I	which one do you think ?
2	3I	bagels . probably bagels and trunc doughnuts .
2	6B	the fans can volunteer -
0	6B	speech therapy . football trunc
2	6B	yeah , i think we do need to keep the prenatal check-ups .
2	3I	bars of soap just snap that next to the face cream .
2	6B	but would n't that be a part of the budget for public bus upkeep already ?
2	3I	yeah . somewhere over here . sure .
2	3I	i might put that with the axes .
1	3I	garden-y type stuff .
1	6B	let 's start - with education and programs . um .
2	6B	oh okay , let 's get rid of the public access . yeah . there 's - we do n't need that . um .
1	6B	do n't know .
1	3I	the opposite side of the refrigerated section ?
2	6B	we 're not gon na be accepting any new ones .
2	6B	i mean acting coach i could see if it comes - you know if we do n't - i could see that - trunc that kinda going away . i mean if you have a drama -
0	6B	we were outsourcing dog catcher .
1	3I	can we head , like by the cake mix ?
0	6B	my parents now go to a synagogue in woodinville , and i have n't like , really gone .
1	6B	score .
1	6B	it used to be king county hospital . is it still ? harborview ?
1	3I	well trunc by the - or the - above the cookies ?
2	6B	cuz we - cuz we were supportive of the arts .
2	6B	yeah , i wan na say , i wan na say , i would n't - i mean , you know . soup kitchen or - i would probably cut the public acid - i trunc i - cuz the dog catcher - i mean , if you do n't - if people do n't know that they 're missing it , if they do n't know that they -
0	3I	bundles of sticks , cool .
1	6B	on county roads they do em , so -
2	3I	oh , buckets seem more , uh , outdoorsy to me , and tow ropes do too .
1	3I	okay . right .
1	3I	would you put trunc empty plastic jugs with here ?
1	6B	that 's important . hospital additions .
1	3I	yeah , with the box knives .
1	3I	what do you think about heavy coats here ?
2	3I	well , i mean , this is , like , useless crap , and this is , like , useful crap .
2	6B	it 's low on the -
1	6B	that seems important . yeah .
0	6B	we did three . we 're done .
1	3I	for the deck chairs , right ?
1	3I	definitely in the dairy section .
0	3I	is there a backpack somewhere ?
2	3I	sure ! put it between the cookies and the sugar .
0	6B	and egg farm regulations .
0	3I	and i have some five pound weights .
1	3I	could be with the food . i do n't know .
1	3I	um . actually -
2	3I	oh , good , we 're done .
2	3I	damn you buckets !
0	6B	i see .
0	6B	i see .
1	3I	how bout if we put it right here ? then we sort of hedge our bets , we might have something better there .
0	6B	and they have - i know they have , um -
1	6B	the worst community ever .
1	3I	or maybe here .
1	6B	needle exchange , maybe ?
2	6B	the two that we cut were the only two we could do .
2	3I	ooh . that should go in this - this is sweets area .
1	3I	yeah face cream . trunc probably next to toilet paper , um -
1	6B	and trunc i think bookkeeping classes .
1	3I	but it 's okay .
1	3I	i think that 's closer to siding . yeah .
0	6B	got ta cut the same number of items . so -
1	6B	do the weed control . yeah .
0	6B	i was like , a seven year old . i could n't - not handle that .
1	6B	maybe prenatal check-ups .
0	6B	now i know why a lot of people -
1	3I	yeah , it would n't be with food , would it ? that would be -
1	3I	and box knives ?
1	3I	ranging everything alphabetically .
2	3I	mm ! how bout trunc with the bagels ?
2	3I	no , we did n't ! um .
1	3I	sticks of butter . so why do n't we put it over in the refrigerated section ?
1	3I	okay . we 'll put it down here . maybe there 's a buncha other -
2	3I	well , i would probably put it here , but -
1	3I	water . maybe with the ice cream ?
0	3I	we 'll have to see how well the other people did .
2	3I	it would n't be good to put it with the human food , right ? no .
2	6B	trunc i think those are important .
2	3I	oh yeah , hey , how bout that ? trunc trunc so maybe , like , traveling stuff . maybe trunc if we ever find car junk , we 'll put it over here .
0	3I	yeah . mm-hmm .
0	6B	we put that under th-
1	3I	like , trunc i mean , yeah , so -
2	6B	and why is the county trunc providing them ?
1	6B	a interesting thing . yes , i trunc i agree .
1	6B	that 's what i 'm trunc yeah .
1	3I	yeah , you 're right .
1	6B	yeah . you 're right .
1	6B	poetry books in the library ?
2	3I	because trunc trunc we eat this for snacks . sometimes . cuz trunc you know , there 's different kinds !
1	6B	could be like -
2	3I	yeah . i have egg timers , which i think should go with the refrigerator magnets .
1	6B	we could cut three from each list without uh -
2	6B	i 'm - i 'm just seeing a duplicate in trunc uh - sexually transmitted diseases and reproductive education . whoops .
2	6B	well , they could . trunc we could still just pick one .
1	6B	gone .
2	6B	it 'd still have to be handled , though .
1	6B	yeah , i cou-
2	3I	yes , totally .
0	6B	sugar free juice machines , bookkeeping classes , and music teachers .
1	6B	alright . fishing licenses .
0	6B	department .
0	3I	side -
2	6B	situation .
1	3I	oh yeah , and the mousetraps .
1	6B	actually eat lunch in the lunch room . we do n't know anything , do we ?
1	6B	i do n't know if that 's important or not . i 've never really been exposed that much that .
1	3I	boating . yeah .
1	6B	people do n't hunt too much .
1	3I	we could do power chords , heavy cable , electric heaters -
0	3I	travel guides we do n't have any outside stuff .
1	6B	could be fundraised for .
0	6B	bagel factory inspections .
0	6B	bagel factory inspections -
1	6B	alright . needle exchange .
2	3I	i do n't think we 're gon na have enough clothing to fills all this . you could use some of this space . yeah yeah , all the good dangerous things .
0	6B	are we doing that too ? or just - ?
2	6B	i can definitely trade off the massage certificates and extra taxi stops -
1	3I	that looks like a great store . i would shop there . i do n't know about those earlier stores .
1	6B	take your pick .
0	3I	an ingredient ?
0	3I	uh , wetsuits ?
0	3I	uh , wetsuits .
2	6B	as far as the level importance , it seems less important than soup kitchens to me .
1	3I	well why do n't we put them - yeah , not really , but -
2	3I	so we 've got healthy stuff and unhealthy stuff . and then , the unhealthy stuff mixed together is over here .
2	6B	how bout reproductive education and weed control .
2	6B	it should . that might be more under the medical side , though . the education might be more under -
1	6B	they do now ? so kids never have chicken pox anymore ? they 're missing out on an important part of childhood .
2	6B	so , maybe there 's some dandelions in the parks , but they 're not getting overrun with some scotch broom or something .
1	6B	that could be - that could -
1	3I	yeah , so -
1	3I	yeah , so -
1	3I	yeah , so -
2	3I	well , i thought they were for fishing , like trunc boats trunc like anchors .
2	3I	that could either be food or sorta utilities sorta things .
2	3I	maybe here . okay . and then the empty plastic jugs , maybe here ? and then i 'll just put books up with travel guides .
1	6B	do we even have a public news station ?
1	3I	i 'm not sure .
0	6B	um . sex offender . egg - or - egg farm and weed control .
2	6B	uh , definitely . that 's - that 's important one . okay , so those three . subway system .
1	6B	i do n't know , like -
1	6B	cuz when they put out the amber alerts it goes out trunc on all stations .
1	6B	acting coaches and assistant cooks were out , right ?
1	3I	okay , and tow ropes , that 's sort of a -
2	6B	well i think that we should choose between public news station and public access station . i do n't think we need both .
0	3I	okay , and we have loose leaf paper . hm .
1	6B	yeah , it 's public health , so - yeah .
1	3I	but we 've - we 've sorta run outta space for camping supplies .
1	6B	maybe . i 'm not a big fan personally but i ca n't let like personal opinions gets in the way .
1	3I	um , cuz you never buy -
2	6B	no , it 's - it 's trunc it 's not drug dealers , per se . what they 're - trunc trunc trunc trunc trunc what they 're - uh , trunc you ca n't do - trunc the problem is , because -
2	3I	sticks of butter , trunc oh , sticks of butter . do you agree it should go near cake mix and sugar ? okay , cool .
1	6B	so we 're gon na get rid of the assistant cooks -
1	6B	um , so it 's actually a small profit center for the public sector to have those juice machines in there .
1	3I	where do we wan na put those backpacks ? how bout we put the backpacks here between fleece lined boots and pet food ?
2	3I	well then , okay . you 're right . mouse traps , box knives , hardware .
1	3I	with the - yeah . right . underneath - let 's put by - underneath the small saws , maybe . okay .
2	3I	oh , yeah but we do n't have any car stuff , right ? so large vest is going to go under boating trunc supply .
1	3I	or sharp weapons this is all kinda done .
0	3I	do they mean for exercising ? or for holding a tarp down or -
1	3I	seem to belong near packages of cookies , simply by virtue of being a baked good . does that sound - ?
0	3I	time 's up !
2	6B	but it seems like - since it 's -
1	6B	i think so . music teachers .
1	6B	yeah . yeah . me too .
2	6B	massage certificates - i would say the towing services .
0	6B	uh . kitten and puppy adoption .
1	3I	but , yeah .
0	3I	that 's interesting .
1	6B	in education and programs , if you have to cut -
0	6B	basketball club .
2	3I	i would say electric heaters .
2	3I	so you would n't -
1	3I	we do sort of have a home -
1	6B	so you would keep that , okay .
0	6B	speed limit signs , additional bus stops -
1	6B	unless it was telling us to - that we had to cut five or four ?
2	3I	so , with the cans of peas and so on ? trunc cuz on cases . yeah .
1	6B	okay . let 's do that . so , hospital additions , neighborhood watch -
1	6B	we need the - wait - veterinary hospital ?
1	6B	public safety , do n't you think ?
1	6B	i agree .

0	6B	it 's trunc it 's - either -
1	3I	yeah . heavy coats . socks .
1	3I	canvas bags . small axes . canvas . so duct tape would be , to me , with uh ,
0	6B	it 's own-
2	6B	that 's a definitely .
2	6B	uh-huh . that 's true . that 's true . i agree with you , yeah . okay .
2	6B	i like that method , actually .
1	6B	right , i do n't know that - yeah , that seems to be a huge thing that -
1	3I	large vests , okay . i have paper bags .
1	3I	hmm . so it 's either here or here .
0	6B	hunting tags , towing services -
0	6B	hunting tags , towing services -
1	3I	and then empty plastic jugs ?
0	6B	the other two were trunc the invasive species removal and weed control .
1	3I	next to sugar ?
2	3I	i think so , yeah . i 've got sticks of butter , that seems like it should be refrigerated .
2	6B	it 's not bringing in any money and -
0	3I	bagels . bagels -
2	3I	well , trunc what do you think ? seriously ?
1	3I	don'tcha - or in the aisle up here ?
2	6B	that i would say get away . give away . we do n't need it .
2	6B	weed control . there we go .
0	6B	veterans -
2	6B	okay i think that 's our seven .
1	6B	the vet hospital ?
1	6B	true . that 's very true .
0	3I	mint toothpaste , oh -
1	6B	we were definitely going to take out s_t_d_ education , cuz that fell under what we 're already paying for , over here .
2	3I	next to ice cream , yeah .
0	6B	it 's under recreation and public services . the veterinary hospital . well i suppose if a -
0	6B	oh , you 've never seen that ? they 're - it 's a station where pretty much anybody can have a show .
0	3I	uh , light jackets .
2	3I	yeah or else the tubing , one of those two . yeah .
0	3I	these -
1	3I	that 's okay . they 're all gon na get put up anyway . bundles of sticks .
0	6B	and taxi stops . those four . okay . done .
1	6B	i think so . i think so .
0	6B	speech therapy 's gone , football equipment 's gone -
1	3I	like , up here ?
2	6B	keep the standards high . pothole maintenance , subway , of course . hunting tags are important . towing services are important . certificates for massage .
0	6B	prenatal , neighborhood watch , weed control , veteran 's medical .
1	6B	or maybe it 's lost parking revenue or something .
1	3I	backpacks . um - along here ?
1	3I	tow ropes would be , like -
2	3I	yeah . uh , well -
2	6B	i think this one is not fair . boys basketball club ? what about the girls ? girls can play soccer too .
2	6B	i think that one definitely hasta go . i understand why it 's there .
0	6B	it 's football equipment .
1	6B	and we 're cutting !
1	3I	the cookies and the donuts could be on the other side of the cake mix , or something .
2	3I	now do you wan na do with clothes or over here ? i 'd say by the boating supplies . yeah .
2	6B	boy , we need that .
1	3I	okay , how about with the kitchen stuff ?
1	3I	okay . scissors , probably up here ?
1	6B	what about massage certificates ?
0	6B	food bank .
0	6B	food bank .

1	6B	so , poetry , football , and sugar-free juice machines . okay .
2	3I	kay , risky .
1	3I	traveling stuff ?
1	3I	maybe across from -
1	3I	fishing net . probably up by the boating supplies and sticks .
1	3I	these are more sporting and hardware , perhaps ?
1	6B	yeah , cuz if - yeah .
2	3I	let 's put it with the boating supplies . people need flags on their boats .
1	3I	alright that goes up here .
2	6B	i 'd say we get rid of the dog catcher .
1	3I	bad stuff .
0	6B	weed control . that 's four .
1	3I	wait heavy coat then thick sweater .
1	6B	speed limit signs , i guess we need cuz people keep -
2	3I	i do n't know why you 'd have coats on the end , but that 's okay . five-pound weights should be -
0	3I	the only people i know who use box knives are the people who people these shelves . um
1	3I	that can - yep . yep . that 's fine . or they could go with the mouse traps and stuff , but this is fine . fleece lined boots , that 's our clothing aisle , here .
1	3I	food .
1	3I	food .
1	3I	food .
1	3I	food .
2	6B	you know , that 's when it gets - that 's when it gets tense .
1	6B	you know , that hallways and the -
1	3I	yeah , there .
0	6B	boys ' basketball club .
2	6B	they can fundraise .
1	6B	massage therapists are licensed .
1	6B	yeah , it 's , like sims city . where , like , your town is just , like , a nuclear wasteland .
0	6B	acting coaches , poetry books , special ed . teachers -
1	3I	yeah , there 's a whole bunch of -
0	6B	i 'm pretty sure it 's where you 're going .
2	3I	i do n't know ! this reminds me of the port gamble -
2	3I	books of matches . those are normally up front um -
0	6B	is that four okay .
1	6B	well , for starters we 're trunc going to do the three sugar , football equipment .
1	3I	books . i did n't know there was gon na be a book -
1	3I	yeah , i think maybe down here
2	6B	i know that .
1	6B	everything trunc helps -
3	3I	next to refrigerator magnets !
2	6B	book keeping classes . i guess it 's good if - for people who , like , run their own businesses .
1	3I	trunc uh - yeah yeah yeah .
2	3I	i do n't know . it seems like this area is open and we could put clothing in there . but -
1	3I	up with you 're , um -
0	6B	i thought i heard the door .
1	3I	either there . yeah . loose leaf paper .
1	3I	okay . okay , we 're done , heather .
0	3I	and wetsuits -
1	3I	that 's good .
1	6B	that 's good .
1	3I	bags of peat moss goes near -
1	3I	oh , okay ! yeah . that - that works .
1	6B	i 'd can the news station .
1	3I	and this is all kinda h-
2	3I	mm - i do n't know , maybe with refrigerator magnets . i mean , maybe that 's -
2	6B	towing stop - towing services are very important . you know people are -
2	6B	oh , what about the county library ?
1	6B	okay , recreation and public services . go ahead , you can read them .
0	6B	know if they fund it but they must - maybe they trunc
2	6B	have them try to consolidate . um . toxic waste disposal . like , that 's important . you ca n't , like , just dump it down the drain ! um -
0	6B	i do n't know . i just sign up , and go out there and - i work on the same trunc we 've been doing the burke gilman trail . yeah , it 's , uh -
1	3I	that - there 's - that 's kinda a recreation .
1	3I	it 's still sort of food item , on the other one . oh , oh , yeah , pouches of oatmeal .
0	3I	mm . yep .
1	3I	how many aisles do you think this is ?
1	3I	this is true . this is true . so they might apply to the camping sections as well .
1	3I	okay , so heavy coats next to the travel guides .
2	6B	animal hospital and so i would say let 's not expand . i mean that and that 's a huge chuck of change - uh capital . trunc yeah .
1	3I	over here , maybe ?
1	3I	alright . and looks like our -
0	6B	um . is that , like - i 'm assuming , the same as a license ?
2	3I	obviously .
2	3I	obviously .
1	6B	for who ?
2	6B	yeah we come back to that . food bank . yes . um . junior soccer league . they can play on their own .
1	6B	well , it just is there . now if we were to find two under recreation and public services . we were there once .
0	3I	we have cans of peas .
0	6B	neighborhood watch support .
0	6B	neighborhood watch support .
0	6B	neighborhood watch support ?
0	6B	neighborhood watch support .
1	3I	or - okay .
2	3I	uh-oh , we 're encroaching on the cans of stuff . mint toothpaste and beets . toothpaste .
1	3I	like in here ?
0	6B	yes . okay , so we have massage certificates to get rid of .
2	6B	we 're pretending .
1	3I	oh . very good . very good .
0	6B	public news station and public access station -
1	3I	yeah , we do n't have a garden section . these are the same as the lists so we sorta do n't - yeah i think so .
1	6B	that kind of stuff so .
1	6B	i do n't - is that a city expense ?
1	3I	gon na go on that side , too .
1	6B	yeah , trunc um , i think i understand , yeah .
1	3I	um how bout here ?
1	6B	more i 'm thinking more of these as targeting .
1	3I	yeah , like sweets ?
2	3I	yeah , i would too , so -
1	6B	i think it could be low on the priority list , but probably we 'd like to keep it .
1	6B	would - i mean that would be important . to have that .
1	6B	the bag thing , i 'll ask to have it double bagged so i 'll have -
1	3I	right right . that 's the - the -
1	3I	alright . yeah . there we go . that 's a good idea . so right above the boating supplies .
1	3I	i think it 's on this - this area .
1	3I	so , probably -
1	3I	next to light jackets ? okay .
1	3I	yeah , between .
0	6B	that anybody can go on and do - it 's what - it 's what we did before youtube .
0	3I	start a , um -
2	6B	okay , we 'd trunc probably have to - if we have to make cuts and they 're spending too much money , uh , trunc bagel factory inspections .
0	3I	bags of peat moss .
0	3I	bags of peat moss .
0	3I	bags of peat moss ?
0	3I	bags of peat moss .
0	3I	bags of peat moss .
0	3I	bags of peat moss .
0	3I	bags of peat moss .
0	3I	bags of peat moss .
0	3I	bags of peat moss .
0	3I	bags of peat moss .
0	6B	oh , yeah . uh .
2	6B	that 's true . or they could focus on those -
1	3I	with the heavy cable , power cords , all of those . yeah .
2	3I	so we 've got boating supplies . uh la trunc boating supplies , we could put our wetsuits , tow ropes , fishhooks , and fishing net near the boating supplies .
1	6B	these are all the drastic trial cuts . alright .
1	3I	trunc probably you 're right , it 's probably , like , a box cutter , cuz it would be box of knives .
2	3I	this aisle is getting neglected .
1	3I	in there ?
1	6B	should we go list by list ?
1	6B	keep that ?
1	6B	keep that .
1	3I	that 's right , we get three at a time .
1	3I	come duct tape . yeah , yeah , yeah , good .
2	6B	i 'm not quite sure how weed control is a public health issue . i mean , if there 's too many weeds in public areas , how does that jeopardize people 's health ?
1	3I	i guess we have to put it over here .
0	3I	workout ?
1	3I	duct tape . box knives .
1	3I	miscellaneous sharp implements area . alright . oop ! i drew two . there you are .
1	3I	as when i think of both boating supplies and gas powered cook stoves , i think of camping . i would -
2	6B	i say yes .
1	3I	oh trunc ight .
2	6B	reproductive education . that 's staying .
1	6B	like it 's gon na -
1	6B	that kind - i mean , this and this i think are usually non-profit community organizations , the junior soccer league and the boys basketball club .
2	6B	it 'd be equally important to invest - at least equally important to invest in , like , the biggest university and research -
0	3I	pet food was there , yeah . package-
1	6B	kind of import-
1	6B	education 's important .
1	6B	right , cuz people ca n't drive on the trunc on the streets . subway system .
1	6B	um , not really .
0	6B	cooking classes
1	3I	you know , flags could be at the end of a row , up by whiskey .
1	6B	food bank trunc very , yeah .
1	3I	kay , we 'll put that above the - supplies . we have net , wetsuit , and fishhooks .
0	3I	where would be the most canned item -
1	3I	that is sometimes muddled at grocery stores , i feel .
2	6B	so i - this is just an odd list to me .
2	3I	so i can see this going under refrigerator magnets , cuz they 're small , and - you know trunc okay . trunc
1	3I	either near the baking things or near sorta the trunc like -
2	3I	boy . okay .
1	3I	yeah . trunc uh , right . uh , it 's a household -
0	6B	sex trunc sex offender database , the veterans medical assistance -
2	6B	mm . i think it 's important to keep the community news ads to keep the community informed and together .
2	6B	but it calculates the force vectors automatically .
2	6B	i think you have to have those .
1	6B	okay . yeah . right . okay .
1	3I	so maybe just next to power cords , small saws .
0	6B	so we have public news , foodbank -
0	6B	boy basketball club , trunc
1	6B	yeah , pest control . yeah .
2	3I	bagels , and chocolate bars . so these have to go over here somewhere , and shoelaces goes with shoes , if we ever get any .
1	3I	egg timers . we could put em back in the bathroom or we trunc
0	6B	education and programs .
0	6B	education and programs .
1	3I	cuz that 's - that 's an a -
0	6B	kay ? does that sound reasonable ?
2	6B	i do n't know . let 's cut that one .
2	6B	well for sure - okay , my top choice for cutting it is the juice - machines .
1	3I	buckets ! i 'd do the same again , would you ?
1	3I	would you say this aisle ?
2	6B	let 's - let 's get rid of the and the football stadium upkeep .
1	6B	yeah , those are pretty important .
2	6B	why do n't we - alright . we 're changing our mind . invasive species removal and weed control .
0	3I	can of peas .
1	6B	neighborhood watch support , sure .
1	3I	yeah , that 's baking .
1	3I	that looks good .
1	3I	that looks good .
1	6B	that looks good .
1	3I	that looks good .
2	6B	yeah , i do n't know trunc it 's a tough one .
1	3I	is there any other ? oh , fishing net -
2	3I	boxes of doughnuts . i 'm presuming they probably go by the chocolate bars and the ice cream .
2	3I	we 'll make that the refrigerator section .
1	3I	yeah . egg timers .
1	3I	i do n't know . um -
1	6B	yeah , that 's what -
1	3I	loose leaf paper below large cups and scissors below , um -
0	6B	so , i do n't know what the public news station is . i do n't know whether that 's like a k_u_o_w_ kinda thing or -
1	3I	face cream . okay , let me see here . this would go -
0	3I	okay . and then , socks .
1	3I	good call .
2	6B	cooking classes . is gone .
0	3I	alright , large cups .
1	3I	would n't you - like it 's - would n't - where would you go get a timer ?
0	6B	so about nineteen ninety .
1	3I	oh ! they should be over here somewhere . by the bagels ?
1	3I	boxes of doughnuts are food .
1	3I	yeah , me too . i like it .
2	6B	um , boy 's basketball club that - you know , those are things that .
1	3I	yeah , that works . um i have buckets and cups .
0	3I	fleece lined boots .
0	3I	fleece lined boots .
0	3I	office-y stuff and kid toys , wetsuits , books -
2	6B	but i do n't think we 're necessarily cutting these things forever until the end of time . we could probably - do a trial cut for a year .
2	6B	obviously need those .
1	3I	saws .
0	6B	they say there 's a stray dog out here and along comes a truck and they pick em up and put em in a little place .
1	3I	yeah . fine .
2	6B	if there 's a neighborhood watch and something happens , they just call the police .
1	3I	near the toilet paper .
1	3I	that 's fine .
1	6B	that 's fine .
1	6B	that 's fine .
1	6B	notetakers for disability services . that 's the only thing there is for disability , so -
1	3I	we have n't gotten into - but maybe - maybe over here , because it 's kinda by -
1	3I	wood .
2	6B	you know , who i think - you know , they have a home , yeah but - those are for straight up homeless people . so that 's important . housing assistance .
1	3I	you know these seem to be good together cuz they 're - they 're -
1	3I	something
1	3I	yeah , yeah sure ! yeah , kinda house -
1	3I	more like outdoorsy . boating supplies , and -
2	6B	public news station is important . oh no !
1	3I	okay , that 's - that 's the -
2	3I	oh . do you wan na do that ? oh that 's a good idea .
1	3I	up here somewhere ?
1	6B	right right right .
1	3I	keep coming .
1	6B	well , this is gon na show my bias , but what about tattoo artist licenses ?
1	3I	ah ! you 're - yes .
1	3I	large sweaters - i mean large vests and thick sweaters and light jackets .
1	6B	that could -
1	6B	that could -
2	6B	yes and no . they 've - uh , the problem is , all of the banks currently in the state of trunc we 've done away pretty much with state regulation .
1	3I	either - uh .
0	6B	oh , now it 's back .
0	3I	gotten , like , gardening supplies yet .
2	3I	we can only look at three , though .
1	3I	i do n't know . maybe , maybe by like , some of these items . like , we have our -
1	6B	junior soccer league - i think we 've done basketball club and i think -
1	6B	um , weed control , we said i think that we 'd cut that one . pre-natal -
0	6B	why , thank you !
1	6B	oh we 're not , oh , i 'm willing to take out -
2	3I	and trunc i do n't think we 're supposed to go above this line , that 's -
2	6B	i think that 's important . people need extra help .
2	6B	which , i 'm not sure how that 's - yeah i think it 's pretty much the same .
1	3I	fishing net or , yeah .
1	6B	food bank is important .
1	6B	i think that 's a good idea .
2	6B	why would you support - ? why would you support towing - ?
2	6B	keep that for now . um .
1	6B	trunc or - i dunno .
2	3I	i think we did a great job . i 'd shop here .
1	3I	hm ? that sounds good . cuz it - they 're both sort of baking supplies .

1	3I	that 's it . yeah , refrigerator magnets , yeah .
2	6B	kay , toxic waste disposal , that 's really important .
1	3I	it 's - uh - the - um -
1	6B	since we have sex ed . yeah , okay . sure . just both of them ? okay , cool . recreation and public services . stray cat spaying . that is probably actually good . because cats -
0	3I	oh , where 's the water ?
1	3I	and the -
1	3I	okay , that makes sense . cuts , and then cable .
0	3I	household sort-of equipment-y things -
1	6B	it 's a big ti-
1	3I	shoelaces . maybe over here with clothing ?
2	3I	this is turning into an awesome store .
2	3I	well this is -
1	3I	should this be down - ? since we do n't really have baked goods we have the doughnuts and cookies , but-
1	3I	have to - yeah , okay .
3	3I	okay this is in - well , these big box things are kind of -
1	6B	i think we should keep those .
2	6B	well , you know trunc the problem is , though -
1	6B	oh ! that 's right . we were going back to it . that 's right .
1	6B	should we keep that one ?
2	6B	here , so the teenagers are already getting reproductive and s_t_d_ education .
0	6B	sex e-
1	3I	should we put it over here with the outdoor -
2	6B	yeah . definitely we 'd n-
1	3I	oh ! we got heavy coats .
1	6B	that 's right . it was the taxi stops and the bus stops .
1	3I	huh , kind of a tool thing . hats .
0	3I	tow ropes
0	3I	tow ropes
1	3I	there 's roll of duct tape which could go anywhere , but we -
0	3I	canvas bags
1	6B	cooking classes and juice machines , then ?
1	3I	where would you put , like , produce ? i guess beets were really the only thing on there that would be -
0	3I	kay , light jackets .
2	3I	oh , our egg timers . those are random . maybe by refrigerator magnets ! that seems like it would be -
1	3I	um let 's see . i guess there .
0	3I	where 'd i put the cake - ? there it is .
1	6B	i think pre-natal checkups is fine , i guess .
1	3I	uh , pre-cut wood is over there with the trunc uh , the hardware , the building hardware .
0	6B	like , the lunch lady ?
1	3I	yeah , we do n't have a category there really . yeah .
1	3I	tow ropes . and i 'm gon na put that with boating .
1	6B	oh , okay . apparently .
0	6B	type thing .
0	6B	type thing .
2	3I	no , this is veggies .
1	3I	cookstoves , backpacks . okay .
1	3I	not like a national flag , but who knows ?
1	3I	these would be the end of it .
2	6B	yeah , they can fundraise .
1	6B	public health . this i-
1	6B	so , should we knock that one out ? that 's not a county cost , anyway .
1	3I	next to -
1	3I	here or up there .
0	6B	and junior soccer , yeah .
0	6B	okay so that 's , um - one - no . one .
2	6B	it 's a public service .
1	6B	we probably need that .
2	6B	what ? where - where are we ? are we doing this for a county ? like , county-wide dog catcher ? i trunc i do n't see trunc dog catchers i think - i do n't think we have to worry about that .
0	3I	well , toilet paper is paper goods .
2	3I	definitely . eggs trunc absolutely . absolutely .
2	3I	i would probably get it in the household things , but that 's - we do n't have a good category for that .
2	6B	that is pretty different and -
2	3I	where did we put the cups ? over here ? we could 've put em with those things over there . the liquids .
0	6B	um , yeah , so we did that for one day .
1	6B	well the police do the dog catching , do n't they ?
2	3I	fridge .
2	6B	with one stroke ? that 's amazing .
2	6B	so , s_t_d_ education , i think that 's important . i feel like - if these were my departments , that i would , like -
1	3I	well , let 's go - well , let 's see . that 's dairy-ish , right ?
0	6B	i guess ones that they pay for as opposed to - my guess - volunteer .
0	6B	i do n't know . it 's only about four spots worth .
0	6B	kay , recreation ? and public services .
1	3I	yeah , okay . okay .
1	6B	do those seem -
2	6B	priorities .
2	3I	or could it be with the camping stuff , maybe , for the duct tape ?
0	6B	issue .
2	6B	yeah . it 's broken . we need to come up with something else for it .
1	6B	uh , easily replaceable . and , uh , possibly the football equipment simply because -
1	6B	additional bus - oh , we cut the bus stu-
1	3I	i - they can go anywhere .
2	6B	trunc trunc yes . yes .
1	6B	one , two , okay so . public health and safety , reproductive education . it 's like - which is like sex ed .
2	3I	yeah . yeah . oh , yeah .
1	6B	kay . mm-hm .
1	6B	got ta keep that .
2	3I	oh god . yeah . that would be - there .
1	3I	with the boats and stuff ? is that it ?
2	3I	could be camping stuff . it could be trunc nah , it 's probably more like camping stuff .
2	3I	the cake mix on that side , yeah are we doing two aisles , so , like , this is more like our cereal or oatmeal trunc oh sorry , and that 's , like , baking maybe ? okay .
2	6B	is important , but it -
0	3I	mm-hmm . housewares .
1	3I	packages of cookies , next to the donuts ?
2	6B	and take out - take out the licensing stuff ? we 're losing income .
2	6B	food bank you got ta keep . yeah . alright .
1	6B	custodians are good .
1	3I	maybe it would fall trunc somewhere in between -
2	6B	i - that kinda falls under the other ones . i can see why they put it in there . like tattoo artists and teaching . but i think massage is different .
1	3I	and this is all food .
2	3I	wan na put the chocolate bars be-
1	6B	maybe we can get rid of them .
2	3I	well , the - on the other side . the little kiddies wo n't know . and the parents could pick it up while their kids are shopping !
0	3I	kay . bottles of juice .
1	6B	yeah . think we should keep that .
1	3I	maybe ? yeah .
1	3I	so , let 's put it between the heavy cable and the duct tape .
2	3I	yeah , do it .
1	6B	i 'm - i 'm assuming . as opposed to someone -
2	6B	i ai n't gon na do that to my dog
2	6B	trunc stadium would save more money .
1	3I	alrighty . you get to pick a few .
2	6B	yeah , yeah , yeah . junior soccer league sounds co-ed . yeah . uh , but boys ' basketball club does not .
2	6B	we have dog catcher and pest control .
1	3I	yeah . and backpacks .
1	3I	well , we 've got large vests there .
2	6B	i would cut invasive species removal , and i would try to make it volunteer-based . because that 's the kinda thing that kids 'd do for like , volunteer hours . and it 's kinda fun , and like , gets kids involved with community clean-up , and would reduce like , the cost of employing people to do it .
1	3I	an edge wall , and edge wall , and then three -
1	6B	okay , so neighborhood watch instead of veterans ? okay .
2	3I	that would be very good . ice cream 's frozen so let 's put that bottles of juice underneath the eggs . that 's a - i see that in the grocery store sometimes .
2	3I	oh , um how bout right there ?
2	6B	i was thinking five .
1	3I	do all the start - start anyway - have all the clothing - sweaters .
0	6B	kitten trunc kitten and puppy adoption .
1	3I	in case there 's more -
1	3I	an extra aisle ?
1	6B	work somewhere else .
2	6B	um - but it 's not very important to me , personally , so -
1	6B	hm , so - football -
2	3I	um , let 's put those near the backpacks . got ta get kids ready for school .
1	3I	well , the cable and -
2	3I	that aisle is awesome .
1	3I	let 's put - start clothes up - way up there so - yeah .
1	3I	let 's see , i guess -
2	6B	uh , you expect that at places like the fast food restaurants because they have these buttons , but they do n't trunc i mean , it 's all done for them , you know ? they do n't have to -
1	3I	it could go either way .
2	3I	so i 'm gon na put it , like -
2	3I	easy .
2	6B	okay , so to me , one that can go off is bagel factory inspections .
2	6B	not so sure . it 's also -
1	3I	oh , absolutely .
1	3I	would it be helpful to spread everything out on the table ?
1	3I	okay , and bundles of sticks , i would think , maybe by siding , boating supplies . okay , so think there ?
2	3I	so , trunc that should go up there . but really -
1	3I	kay yeah traveling with axes .
2	6B	assistant cooks . i ca n't really see - let 's just -
1	3I	ideal .
1	3I	trunc i think we could totally do that .
2	6B	no . they - what they do is they call -
2	6B	but the subway system is , like , a centralized thing . i do n't know .
1	3I	sounds -
1	3I	you know , in - in the city we have -
2	6B	so , we 're going to cut boys basketball . to make a statement .
2	6B	if we were to cut one then the duties that its cut will fall under the other
1	3I	eh , i 'll put it next to the siding .
1	6B	mm . that 's true .
1	3I	books where do it - travel guides , books .
1	3I	or beneath it .
1	6B	maybe . we could have the kids in the schools do the assisting . or they could be custodians .
1	3I	food . next to the eggs , and the - ?
1	6B	it 's nice to have like services for kids in a community , but -
1	6B	just as well done by like , volunteers slash students . i dunno .
0	6B	taxi -
1	6B	no , trunc trunc right .
1	6B	i feel like reproductive and s_t_d_ is very similar . one of trunc is kinda - kinda - k-
1	6B	important things like taxes or uh stuff like that then math - math tutors can be very , very handy .
1	3I	yeah , start putting in the food - more food stuff there .
2	3I	do we trunc or we could put it over here , somewhere .
1	3I	people wo n't have trouble finding things in this one .
1	6B	i would do that .
1	3I	so , i 'm thinking these are , like volumes of paper bags .
1	3I	i mean it 's trunc it 's somehow in the - fall into recreation . well -
1	3I	maybe . okay .
2	6B	we 'll see . we 'll see . you know , it 's gon na be interesting .
2	6B	sex ed could -
1	6B	yes , the food bank . i agree .
1	6B	housing assistant we need . dog catcher -
2	3I	or - or next to toys , i mean , kinda just more miscellaneous items .
2	3I	pa. well , the three of these things are made , so packages of cookies , boxes of donuts , and bagels .
1	3I	canvas bags , that 's kind of , like , uh - uh , camping supplies . so that 'd trunc i think that would go over here .
1	3I	next to oatmeal ?
0	3I	okay m-
0	3I	pet food and toys are opposite .
1	3I	yeah , put it next to the pre-cut wood , maybe ?
1	3I	goes over here .
2	3I	outta place , there .
1	6B	how bout the stray cat spaying ?
1	3I	kinda stuff .
1	6B	well , if you - if you took - if you -
0	6B	trunc oh .
1	6B	feel guilty .
2	3I	it 's got ta go over here .
1	3I	light jackets , large vests -
2	6B	i see what you mean . okay , let 's drop acting coaches . they 'll - they 'll - if a kid wants it they 'll figure it out somehow
1	3I	have any trouble putting it next to the cake mix ?
2	3I	you are bad . go down there .
1	6B	i mean , yeah . we 've been in to see that and it 's really . yeah . yeah , right . exactly . mm-kay , so we have junior soccer guard - did we cut junior soccer league ?
2	6B	could the public access station show the news ads - ?
2	6B	yeah , trunc the public access station , we have no business doing it in the first place , so can that .
1	6B	they might .
1	6B	they might .
0	3I	a jug as in something you drink out of ? or a jug as - well , i guess that - i dunno what other kinda jug there is , actually .
2	6B	yeah . this is interesting because we 're uh - volunteering at our neighborhood elementary school . you can see all this stuff , going into the big public - big public , you know elementary school . it 's really fun . i mean , bookkeeping classes . that 's a real skill . i just -
0	3I	there you go .
1	6B	i 'd say yes . music teachers ? yes .
0	3I	um , hats .
2	3I	yeah , i mean , i would put milk there .
2	3I	well i have the juice . we could put -
0	6B	they just - private that goes and gets it - and they get - yeah .
1	3I	perhaps across the aisle from the small axes ?
2	6B	invasive species removal , i 'm in favor of .
2	3I	okay . cuz the sugar is and the cake mix is there . i 'd put them together .
2	6B	yeah . well , i mean , if we 're not gon na - they have to upkeep it if it 's gon na get used . right ?
2	3I	we could put the , uh -
2	6B	mm we 're not really doing anything with them . just catching em and putting em in pound
1	3I	or , well or we could start using this side if you want .
1	3I	okay , trunc why do n't you go first , let 's see what you 've got .
2	6B	especially trunc if this is seattle . i dunno where we are living here but -
1	3I	oh . yeah , there 's no clothes here .
1	6B	so maybe it 's the assistant cooks .
2	6B	yeah . especially - i mean , you 've been on i_-five , you know ? when it 's like , there 's a - literally a car blocking an entire lane of traffic . you know , and it 's like , you need to get that hauled away . um , massage certificates ?
1	3I	like right here ?
1	3I	might be able to leave those for -
1	3I	seriously ?
0	6B	trunc recreation and public services . right .
1	3I	no , it does n't really matter to me , so -
1	3I	so , let 's - let 's put - ooh , ooh , ooh . ooh , trunc okay . okay .
1	6B	childbirth , and -
1	6B	but i think - do we have four ? yeah . say the vet hospital now .
1	3I	oh , yeah . trunc small saws and small axes . scissors .
1	6B	not really that important , i guess mm - massage certificates .
2	6B	well , it would be like a teaching trunc you do have to go through a test . you have to go through -
2	6B	so we ca n't get rid of that .
2	6B	no no , no no no no . it 's okay .
0	3I	did you work at a store ?
2	3I	this is gon na be in the fishnets . and then we left these two here . cups , probably with the jugs . i do n't know where we would put five pound weights .
1	6B	or we could do three . we could do the chicken pox , maybe .
0	6B	so we have -
1	6B	boy if you 've got -
2	6B	i do n't know why we have to have that publicly funded .
1	6B	yeah , okay . sounds good .
2	3I	yeah yeah , probably up - maybe even the top where the boating supplies are , like outdoor stuff .
1	3I	i 'd probably store them by the mousetraps .
0	3I	large cups tsh tsh tsh tsh tshwe do n't have anything like that yet ?
1	6B	sounds good . alright , education programs . math tutors , how important are those ?
1	3I	we could start with the outerwear , i guess . next to the toys , going down , or - ?
0	3I	but packages of cookies .
2	6B	if it 's a choice between the poetry books and the actingcoaches , i 'd keep the coaches , because they 're actually teaching and the books are just books .
2	3I	we do n't know what they 're for . we do n't know if it 's for , like , travel -
2	3I	oh . maybe even here !
1	6B	dog catcher and reusable bag campaign .
0	3I	from the list that there 's some camping supplies , right ?
1	3I	little sort of utilitarian things .
0	3I	yeah , the chocolate bars , huh .
1	3I	outside ?
1	3I	although you might be right .
1	3I	very nice . and the last thing we have . uh . celebratory box of doughnuts . um , let 's put those -
1	3I	unused aisle .
1	3I	and this is becoming a bit of a back to school section it seems here with the backpacks and the toys .
1	6B	me too . let 's cut that .
0	6B	sex offender database .
0	6B	sex offender database .
0	6B	sex offender database .
0	6B	sex offender database .
1	6B	do n't -
1	3I	power trunc cords ?
0	6B	is that at temple b'nai torah ? or is that - ?
2	6B	the usual terms of all the hospitals . at least here at the u_ dub and they just - you know - they can get money from the gates foundation or somebody else . who cares about the trunc not that they do n't care but -
1	6B	basketball somewhere else i guess .
2	3I	yeah , just stick it - yeah , just go trunc stick it with the pet food . yeah . i feel like when i go into , like , walmart or target it 's , like , pet food , like -
0	3I	uh , box knives -
0	3I	uh , box knives .
1	3I	empty plastic jugs for camping ? car camping . uh - un - er - fishing i guess . if you go -
0	3I	not really .
0	3I	not really .
0	3I	not really .
2	3I	sure ! that would be , like , the dry goods cups and plates an-
1	6B	invasive species removal ? i think we could get rid of weed trunc weed control .
0	6B	but it - but it - it is operated by king county , right ? so -
1	6B	we could get rid of those , um , taxi stops .
2	3I	that 's like - we have scissors !
2	6B	right , so in a hypothetical world veterinary hospital would be essential .
1	3I	along with the duct tape and power cords and box knives ?
1	6B	could be the first to go .
0	3I	doughnuts , tow ropes , and cushions for deck chairs . box knives . chocolate bars , tweezers , and -
1	6B	i feel bad , cuz , you know , it 's a creative -
1	3I	i would say it could go with travel guides . i mean , that 's kinda the , like , outdoorsy aisle .
2	6B	because we do n't know where we are , in the process
1	3I	yeah , i think so .
1	6B	yeah . i think so .
1	6B	yeah , i think so .
1	6B	yeah . i think so .
1	3I	yeah ! i think so .
1	6B	yeah . i think so .
1	3I	yeah , i think so .
1	3I	yeah , i think so .
1	6B	yeah , i think so .
1	6B	yeah . i think so .
1	6B	yeah . i think so .
1	3I	i 'm not really particular about where my bottles of juice go .
2	6B	and the drainage ditches are essential .
1	3I	okay that looks good .
2	6B	juice machine in any school anywhere they can drink water .
2	3I	fish hooks ! there we go there 's a - there 's a natural fit for fish hooks right next to the fishing net .
0	6B	mine neither .
0	3I	and i have flags -
2	3I	cases of whiskey . oh , put it under the camping . i guess . i guess . yeah .
1	6B	community news ads , yeah . i agree . like , one of these - these circulars that you get on your doorstep trunc that 's full of ads and nothing much else except ads . okay . so , we trunc we 're doing , um -
0	3I	ah .
0	3I	ah .
0	3I	ah .
0	3I	ah .
0	6B	ah .
2	6B	pothole maintenance has to stay .
1	3I	i would vote for next to the eggs .
2	6B	well , i do n't know - no , i was just curious why -
2	6B	we have a little activist group in our neighborhood that pays attention to this trunc
1	3I	yeah , let 's put next to scissors . it makes sense .
1	3I	fishing net , next to fish hooks , maybe ?
2	6B	or we are trying to move others to help .
1	3I	yeah , we should do that .
1	6B	and the taxi stops .
1	6B	and the taxi stops .
2	3I	well , what are the trunc uh
1	6B	we got two now , additional bus stops and flagpole repair .
1	3I	oh , that 's right , i forgot .
1	3I	heavy cable . how about with the power cords ?
1	3I	down there ?
1	3I	beets just look so lonely .
0	6B	and then acting coaches 
1	6B	we 're all done !
1	3I	i 'd put it here , in this column . you think that 's okay ?
2	3I	i do n't know . maybe we 'll put it down here .
1	3I	i - yeah , for some reason i would say so too .
1	3I	back trunc backpacks . it could be trunc yeah , could go , uh - yeah .
2	6B	the upper grades and move them down to the lower grades not a good idea , but it 's done trunc was done all the time . i think it 's still being done .
1	3I	maybe in the middle .
1	3I	hardware and recreation ?
1	3I	on the right side of the store .
1	6B	it is - trunc yeah . it is .
2	6B	well , it 's all about whether or not you appreciate the arts .
1	3I	water goes with -
1	3I	to make room .
0	6B	i actually do n't know .
0	6B	okay , uh , those two . tattoo artist licenses .
1	3I	trunc right there , okay .
1	3I	oh , it 's probably , like , two by fours and things , do you think ?
2	6B	humane society and stuff , so i 'm just unclear -
1	6B	so , if we - if we cut sex ed here -
1	6B	it effects our solid waste management , and therefore the county budget .
1	3I	oh , yeah . yeah . okay , yeah that 's a good place .
1	6B	drainage ditches is sure . i have no - so -
0	6B	we could add back three things .
1	3I	okay , above .
1	3I	i mean - i would think all this stuff could just go down -
1	3I	perhaps below the bars of soap ?
1	6B	notetakers for disability services are good .
1	6B	be combined ? oh , that 's a good idea .
2	6B	done . we 're done .
1	3I	or - it 's just kinda a loose grouping of like well these seem to go together .
2	3I	put it here so we can work up , cuz i forget if - how many random things we have . tha-
0	6B	poetry books . exactly .
1	6B	how bout public access station ?
1	3I	let 's just put it down here .
2	6B	who - does that anymore ? like , do n't people use twitter , or something else ?
2	3I	actually you should probably start another one cuz -
0	3I	oh , gas powered cook stoves .
2	6B	well , otherwise , it could be chaos , with taxis stopping everywhere . if you have stops , it could help a little bit .
2	3I	that would be , yeah , cooled . yeah , they should be , yeah .
2	6B	sometimes you can and sometimes you ca n't . like it depends .
1	3I	useful trunc crap .
2	3I	yeah , this is a lot of space for clothes .
1	6B	bagel . the bagel factory inspections . and the hospital additions . yeah .
1	3I	sounds very -
1	3I	this might be , like , a miscellaneous non-food .
1	3I	it must be a little ways away .
0	3I	i do n't see any clothing items at all !
2	6B	yeah let 's keep licensing them .
1	3I	with things like this , maybe ? egg timers , refrigerator magnets -
1	3I	i dunno . trunc yeah , here we go . why not ? rolls of duct tape .
1	3I	oh . soybeans ! yeah .
2	6B	we just do n't know the situation . if - yeah .
1	6B	yeah that is n't - that would n't be the same , would it ?
2	6B	at least one . so maybe we should -
1	3I	huh over there . okay , and trunc this is - this is another one . and our precut wood .
1	3I	yeah , sure okay yeah okay . fish hooks .
1	3I	mint toothpaste down by -
1	3I	i mean , this is a little confusing , but that 's okay .
1	6B	sure , since we do n't know what it is .
1	3I	useful stuff like -
1	3I	let 's do before .
1	3I	we could put them -
1	6B	i would - think um -
1	6B	this is true .
1	3I	this is true .
1	3I	that 's - sort of toiletries , trunc health and beauty . which goes well with the toilet paper .
1	3I	and the chocolate bars .
0	6B	station .
2	6B	i do n't know how to decide where it should belong though .
2	3I	mm-kay . i 've got some egg timers that i 'm putting with the larger cups , just above the there .
0	3I	some books , and some backpacks .
1	3I	we can always wait .
2	6B	yeah , you 'd have to go by federal rules , than whatever . but , yeah - that 's kind of iffy and you 'd have to kind of see what the need is .
0	6B	maybe one or - well yeah because they 're
1	6B	oh , we try for three .

1	6B	and there 's always radio .
0	6B	how many is that ?
1	6B	yeah , let 's do poetry . let 's do poetry .
0	6B	that 's the one you would cut ?
0	3I	even -
2	6B	more bus stops .
1	3I	i think put it more with -
1	6B	sugar fr-
2	6B	and keep -
1	3I	yes , it does .
2	6B	trunc well , except that 's - what that is is regulating tattoo industry . we do n't want anyone on the street -
1	3I	yeah , toiletries .
1	3I	so this is the - the guys .
1	3I	can go by the -
1	6B	trunc vasive species removal .
1	3I	like , here ?
1	3I	like , here ?
1	3I	like , here ?
1	3I	like , here ?
1	3I	like , here ?
1	3I	like , here ?
1	3I	all those things are flammable except for the box knives .
2	6B	you know . i dunno , it 's kinda -
0	3I	light jackets .
0	3I	light jackets .
0	3I	light jackets .
0	3I	light jackets ?
0	3I	light jackets .
0	3I	light jackets .
0	3I	light jackets .
0	3I	light jackets .
0	3I	light jackets .
0	3I	light jackets .
2	6B	well what about taxi stops , though ?
1	3I	probably with duct tape again , maybe ?
0	6B	i useta go there .
1	3I	boating or traveling ?
1	3I	oh yeah . um -
0	3I	things you use - you know , your iron , and stuff .
0	6B	football stadiums that can
1	6B	where would the towing services be absorbed into ?
2	3I	mm-hm . mm-hm , trunc refrigerator magnets cups , yep .
0	6B	so that if you go to a licensed massage person , they 've had some training .
1	6B	we can go back .
1	3I	heavy coats . thick sweaters .
1	3I	kay . um -
1	3I	i would say that goes near the cake mix .
0	3I	bag .
2	6B	i do n't think that 's in - in this department really .
1	3I	like , maybe here ?
1	3I	none of these are really -
2	3I	these are gon na get harder . tweezers .
1	6B	well let 's look at what we have , and then figure out what we think we can afford to cut .
1	3I	that 's outdoor ? i do n't know , it 's kinda random .
1	3I	okay . so we can just choose one for clothing maybe .
1	3I	bottles of juice could - could be .
2	6B	yeah , something . veterinary hospital . i do n't think veterinary hospital should be a government thing , i think that should be private .
2	3I	uh , beneath it . yeah . whatever , yeah .
1	3I	oh on - oh , i 'd forgotten about that well , we could - put it over there and start - okay got some hats .
1	3I	camping - wan na give me half of those ? yeah , thanks .
1	3I	something to store -
1	3I	yeah , i mean i guess it should be near trunc well -
1	6B	trunc yeah , trunc actually , trunc those are the ones that we said before . okay .
0	6B	so , looking through that list , math tutors , assistant cooks , sex ed , custodians , speech therapy , football equipment , acting coaches , poetry books -
3	3I	cases . what - or with the juice and the water .
0	6B	like what does that mean ? like - ?
2	6B	speed limit signs are important .
1	6B	football 's really expensive . like the equipment per person , per athlete .
1	3I	maybe near the soybean because it 's a - it 's a non-perishable produce item .
1	6B	yes . i agree .
2	3I	do you want to do that and have the - ? trunc nah . alright , so i have light jackets .
1	6B	public bus upkeep ? yes . drainage trunc ditches ?
1	3I	off the side .
2	6B	sugar free juice machines , no .
0	6B	well , hm-
2	6B	but are n't there private - ?
1	6B	well , exactly . that 's exactly it .
1	6B	or for that matter , it would be port of seattle .
1	3I	maybe produce
2	6B	so , i feel reproductive education is very important .
2	6B	well i would rather have kids off the street and into strong sports , and have trunc more stray cats , i guess .
0	6B	what 's a trunc what 's a massage- ? what 's a massage certificate ?
2	6B	people do n't know how to take care of themselves . i think that 's really important .
1	6B	like company for somebody .
1	3I	i trunc bucket next to plastic jug and siding or -
1	3I	does that seem right to you ?
0	3I	paper bags . kay .
1	6B	the public access station we can we kind of -
1	3I	we do n't know what kind of flags we 're talking about , do we ?
1	3I	we do n't know what it is , so let 's go -
1	3I	trunc oh , right . okay .
1	6B	was that , um , you know , it 's a violation of the federal law .
1	6B	i would say find one in each first .
1	3I	food . ice cream .
2	6B	then kitten and puppy adoption becomes a little less of a -
2	6B	uh , special trunc special ed teachers are probably a federal requirement , and so are note takers for disabled kids , so those three are safe i think .
1	6B	if you do n't have this .
2	6B	well , no , it 's -
1	3I	light jackets ? perfect . okay canvas bags -
2	3I	i 'll put it up here by hats .
2	6B	let 's leave em .
1	3I	should we put them next to our - ?
2	3I	kind of in the middle , maybe ?
2	3I	well this would be more toiletries , right ?
1	3I	eeny meany , miny , moe ?
0	3I	there we go , keys off the floor . okay . um , i have tweezers , light jackets , and you have egg timers .
1	3I	somewhere where - do you wan na put it by the oatmeal ?
2	6B	egg farm regulations , to the best of my knowledge is either a sate department of agriculture , or an f_d_a responsibility .
1	6B	i 'm trunc i 'm discussing .
1	3I	yeah , by the figs . it 's all dry .
1	3I	yeah might be able to fit one more . we have a very crowded store .
0	6B	hm huh .
1	3I	okay , heavy coats , light jackets .
1	6B	like , even -
2	6B	and it 's important .
2	3I	we do n't have anything like this , kind of , i do n't think .
1	3I	power cords and -
1	6B	uh , soup kitchens are good .
0	3I	huh - .
2	6B	now , some would say invasive species removal , but that 's really important for seattle .
1	3I	yeah . refrigerator magnets .
1	3I	with the trunc right next to the ice cream . okay .
1	6B	also question mark .
0	6B	dog catcher , boys basketball .
2	6B	i know - it 's like i should - five . why did i do that ! ?
1	3I	alright , go ahead . yeah , go for it .
1	3I	you know , backpacks or - but - but yeah . we 'll just leave em there .
2	6B	when we did the harborview project , we had state and federal money for that .
1	6B	uh , i do n't know . can we get rid of weed control ?
1	3I	deck chairs on a boat ?
2	3I	oh ! maybe trunc maybe sugar .
1	3I	let 's say it 's - let 's say it 's coleman stoves , and it 's gon na be for outdoor .
1	3I	camping-ish . yeah .
1	3I	down here . it 's - it 's a new kind of -
0	3I	fleece-lined boots .
0	3I	fleece-lined boots .
0	3I	fleece-lined boots .
0	3I	fleece-lined boots .
1	3I	with the clothing again .
1	3I	with toys ?
1	6B	i dunno . i feel differently about it , i guess .
0	6B	we did that for one day in my high school . i forget , it was under my - we had a -
1	6B	we would .
1	3I	yeah , kay .
0	6B	oh . well -
2	3I	sure , with soap . that makes sense .
2	3I	socks i 'd put there with the shoes and the shoelaces , and then we have gas powered cook stoves .
1	3I	running out of space around some of these columns
1	3I	i think we 're going to be able to open the store on time .
1	3I	depends on what the empty plastic jugs are being used for .
1	3I	paper things , yeah .
1	3I	correct in case of .
1	6B	that could go to someplace else .
2	3I	it does n't really relate to anything .
2	3I	could there , or here with toys and you travel with clothes ?
1	6B	i guess they 're kinda similar .
2	6B	all the rest of em are really - i mean , i ca n't ima-
1	3I	yeah . seems right .
0	6B	okay we got -
1	3I	yeah , where was that ? right there . okay , and hats .
0	6B	juice machines . book keeping classes and music teachers . okay .
0	3I	see what we have .
2	3I	wait a minute . sticks of butter , eggs , and liters of water .
0	6B	kay , dog catcher .
1	3I	below the cake mix .
2	6B	i think those ought to be private sector since most of the hospitals are -
2	6B	i dunno . massage certificates . this is weird . taxi stops ?
1	6B	and if we - if we wan na keep with that .
1	6B	or - or - or trunc or parking .
1	3I	close to the toys ?
2	3I	apparently we 've been to , uh -
2	3I	yeah , that 's a good idea also . like , thinking of , like , what people would buy together .
1	3I	uh , probably by , like , the cake mix and doughnuts and stuff .
2	6B	definitely important .
0	3I	uh , duct tape .
1	3I	like construction , boating supplies .
0	6B	reproductive education , job training programs , chicken pox vaccinations , -
2	3I	i think it would go in here , too .
2	6B	i 'd say we get rid of that one , let them have chicken pox for awhile .
1	3I	like , if you 're going trunc this is the outdoors . and then -
1	3I	if you 're trying to sell the two together . um .
2	3I	kinda the sundry stuff here .
0	6B	i dunno what that means . in school . i guess that 's in schools . in the schools that they had more people in the lunch room . yeah .
1	3I	do grab and go .
0	6B	teaching trunc speed limit signs .
1	3I	maybe next to the travel guides . maybe just , like , stick them up here .
2	6B	and all the money that 's bringing in goes straight to the other peoples ' pockets . so there 's not public so screw that . okay . um . so i think that 's - i think that 's good . so get rid of public news , lump that into - public access . um .
0	3I	packages of cookies , boxes of donuts .
2	6B	why do those need to be - but why do those need to be a public service ? we have private -
2	3I	an actual -
2	6B	i - i trunc i trunc saw it on the hundred and one dalmatians , but i do n't - i do n't actually know if that 's real . it 's probably not real life . i think they do have them , but -
1	6B	towing services . well i dunno . breakdowns on the highway that 's pretty important .
1	6B	yeah , towing services .
1	3I	and the boats and all that .
0	3I	trunc small metal .
1	3I	yeah , we could have it so that -
0	3I	and i 've got -
0	3I	uh , beets .
1	3I	yeah , we 'll put the outdoorsy things -
1	3I	cookstove .
1	3I	wetsuits , over trunc oh -
0	3I	okay . your turn .
2	3I	alright . so . tow ropes . um those would probably be good with boating supplies but since that area of the store is pretty crammed up -
0	6B	there 's actually three different c_spans , if you have cable .
1	6B	it 's important , but i 'm not sure if it 's on the top of the list .
1	3I	uh , adjacent to the canvas bags , maybe ?
1	3I	yeah , that 's true . any - any - any deadly weapons . yeah .
1	6B	and you can wait .
0	6B	sugar . football equipment .
2	3I	i like it , yeah . what else ?
0	6B	um , does your partner beat you sign .
1	3I	do it .
1	6B	i would say the sugar free juice machines . okay .
1	6B	yep . we 're done !
1	3I	okay . yeah , cuz that 's
0	6B	spaying .
0	3I	cans of peas .
0	3I	cans of peas .
0	3I	cans of peas .
0	3I	cans of peas .
0	3I	cans of peas .
1	3I	i do n't see anything wrong with that .
1	6B	yeah , trunc yeah . that 's what i trunc mean , i guess . football equipment .
2	3I	uh , let 's just wait on that . cushions , deck chairs . that 's - that 's there . buckets .
1	6B	yeah , sure , we 'll keep it in .
1	3I	would you put it over here , too ?
1	6B	so , i guess that 's kind of important .
1	3I	cookies ! over there with the donuts and the bagels .
0	6B	taxi stops , fishing license , public bus upkeep .
1	3I	more the left column , with either sporting , traveling , or houseware type items . maybe with -
2	6B	what if it 's a food safety issue ?
1	3I	works for me .
1	3I	works for me .
1	3I	works for me .
2	3I	dried figs , so i will put with the cake mix . oh -
2	6B	then part of the cost - trunc part of the cost of the towing should go to the county . from the , uh - from the - the towing service should be - should be taxed by the county -
2	3I	this actually looks a lot like
2	6B	who needs water - for - ? no .
0	3I	cases of whiskey . well -
2	6B	assuming those are the same thing . we could get rid of -
0	6B	what 's the least important on that list ?
2	6B	keeping reproductive education .
2	6B	privatized .
1	3I	hardware and recreation and just - we would just decide which one . but it looks like most of the food stuff is right over here .
2	6B	so , maybe the soup kitchen is more of a county function , cuz there 's public health involved with that , whereas with the food bank you 're handing out packaged things .
1	3I	here , just put it on the table .
1	6B	uh - support for that ? on their own . aha ! there it is ! um -
1	6B	i think we can - trunc any one that jump out at you ?
1	3I	we could just start one .
2	6B	that says a station .
1	6B	so we 're gon na keep the trunc
1	3I	um , i would put them -
1	6B	i think we need to keep drainage ditches .
2	6B	i was thinking football stadium upkeep . we do n't have poor people .
1	3I	yeah , go for it .
1	6B	so who -yeah , we do . so who is this for ?
1	6B	if you 're near water . yeah .
1	6B	at least they 've rationalized the groups .
0	3I	thanks .
0	3I	thanks .
0	3I	thanks .
1	6B	they 're being informed of something they did n't know .
2	3I	maybe it should be down here .
1	6B	public facilities we 'll se what we get when we get over here .
1	6B	boating licenses , probably should keep that too .
1	6B	true . true . let 's keep math tutors .
0	6B	needle exchange , sex offender database .
0	6B	needle exchange , sex offender database -
1	6B	veterans ' medical assistance . i think that 's probably important .
1	6B	the news ads , keep the trunc public access station .
0	6B	yeah . trunc public access station 's like - um - like p_b_s , right ?
1	3I	weapons weapons .
0	3I	which is-
2	3I	saws . oh yeah , outdoor stuff .
0	6B	oh , okay . okay .
2	6B	potholes are -
2	6B	yeah . way . way down . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah .
0	6B	so on that one if we were gon na try to cut it to just six things we 'd have the additional bus stops , the tattoo -
1	3I	we 've got a -
0	6B	okay recreation and public services . um , stray cat spaying .
1	3I	okay , yeah .
1	3I	okay , yeah .
1	3I	okay , yeah .
1	3I	okay . yeah .
1	3I	okay . yeah .
1	3I	okay , yeah .
1	3I	okay , yeah .
1	6B	okay , yeah .
0	6B	affiliated with the school ?
2	3I	yeah yeah , we did it .
2	3I	what 's weird about this is - is there were - they do n't - they do n't care about our organization . they - they only care about how we 're pronouncing these various things . sticks of butter .
1	6B	okay , so we got rid of one . of each one . i think we did very well .
1	3I	oh , with the timer right ? with the egg timer ?
1	3I	cuz there 's rooms there .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape , mouse traps , box knives , precut wood , buckets . okay .
1	3I	picnic supplies ?
2	3I	put the fish hooks , cuz they 're small next to the supplies .
2	6B	i see flagpole repair .
1	3I	we could put em with the boating things .
2	3I	well you - yeah , you could go either way . yeah .
2	6B	public health , hate to cut there too , but let 's see .
1	6B	um . probably ?
1	3I	maybe , like -
1	6B	trunc i do n't know how badly this neighborhood needs a dog catcher .
1	3I	um , i guess next to power cord ?
1	3I	what if we put them across from the bundles of sticks ?
1	6B	i think the newspaper 's important . not sure -
2	3I	yeah , that 's where it goes . yeah , yeah .
1	3I	leave that there for right now , see what else comes up . maybe we 'll decide to move it .
1	3I	in the , uh - with heavy coats and stuff .
1	3I	egg timers goes in , uh -
0	6B	they get trunc they get the regular , um , health inspection .
1	3I	let 's move that up .
1	6B	um , did we also say the adoptions ?
0	6B	what 's an acting coach ?
1	3I	packages of cookies or near the cake mix .
0	6B	um , i do n't know what that means .
1	3I	oh , if you 've got trunc liters of water , do you want juice ?
2	6B	well , i mean - i just - i - i think - i 'm - i do love to watch football . i played it myself in high school .
1	6B	we already have invasive species removal .
0	3I	when -
1	3I	okay . so , maybe just fill in this area right here ?
1	6B	they do .
1	3I	school supplies ? mm-kay .
0	6B	so we 've done six . we had nine in the first one , six now in this one . okay , well we 'll -
1	6B	quite like
2	3I	yeah , trunc i wish we could put it down here .
1	3I	right . that makes more sense .
1	3I	does n't matter .
2	3I	yeah , that 's definitely outdoor stuff i feel like i 'm trunc reorganizing fred meyer .
2	6B	though trunc is n't that , uh , public -
1	6B	yeah , well -
0	6B	kay , moving on .
1	6B	so . okay , so we 're done that .
2	6B	that 's true . maybe if we cut the s_t_d_ education , we can just keep reproductive ?
2	6B	i think people trunc do tattooing without licenses anyway .
0	6B	then they get a list . and they go out and knock on the door . say how do you do ?
1	3I	trunc trunc bags of peat moss .
1	3I	near p-
2	6B	yeah . that does n't require the county . okay .
0	6B	concussion .
1	3I	is it okay if i put it here ?
2	3I	let 's decide they 're school supplies .
1	6B	like the tattooing .
2	6B	cept the one that could n't read til he was fifteen , trunc
2	3I	ca n't have one without the other .
1	3I	trunc the buckets and large cups ?
1	3I	okay . do you wan na try some ? should i , like - ? guess i 'll grab a handful .
0	3I	but , it 's something for trunc going out of doors .
2	6B	i would personally probably put on the , like , not quite as important . but -
2	6B	that 's what i 'm assuming . yeah . they do n't need new equipment every year .
1	6B	well , i 'm thinking the easiest thing to do is to of-
1	3I	sharp implements section .
2	6B	oh , no . we ca n't cut that .
0	3I	moving on .
2	6B	flag pole repair . i mean really
2	6B	being -
0	6B	sokay . so that was - an -
2	6B	so , i am not as excited to cut that .
2	3I	sounds good . i 've got some fleece lined boots . those are very comfy .
2	3I	yep , for sure that goes there . trunc uh-oh , we have n't left any room for this .
1	3I	hats . is there any clothing anywhere else ? um .
1	6B	plus , i mean . do people really even - pay attention to them ?
2	6B	we may not need the extra ones . we 'll hafta see . tattoo artist licenses ?
1	6B	i - i dunno .
1	3I	that 's okay . i think that 's good .
2	6B	so , i do n't think that the county -
2	6B	expenditure for - to create a structure .
1	3I	okay books of matches . somewhere in that same area ?
2	6B	you know . and - and the ones that you say , okay , let 's say , it 's real obvious , flagpole repair -
0	3I	is there a kitchen supplies type area ?
2	6B	i dunno that seems weird to me . no .
0	6B	we 're good , we 're good !
0	6B	and then , uh -
1	6B	uh , the invasive - the invasive species or weed control is the one - i do n't know which one , but i 'd -
2	6B	let 's get rid of weed control . invasive species removal is more overarching .
2	6B	well right now we 've got , uh , let me see , there 's a , uh - there 's a , uh - uh a bug that is going around removing all deciduous trees in the united states .
1	3I	and trunc do we have any trunc oh ! how bout near here ? yeah .
1	6B	which is great -
2	6B	do trunc ? does that need to be - ?
1	6B	that 's - yeah .
1	6B	that 's - yeah .
1	6B	assistant cooks , that one 's questionable it sounds like . um . sex ed -
1	6B	yeah , do n't think that 's a trunc i do n't think that 's a problem right now .
2	3I	well how bout this , fishing net and boating supplies ? you think those make trunc make sense ? okay .
0	3I	that 's trunc i was looking for the word small .
2	6B	public bus upkeep , you need that . drainage ditches , you need that .
2	6B	yeah , i would too . if - i mean , if it was that and the taxi stops . um , tattoo artist licenses . i feel like that 's really important , um , only because people trunc get tattoos and - it 'd be - it 's good to have some you know , oversight ? yeah . um , boating licenses . especially in washington -
2	3I	i think we 're gon na go over here in this -
2	3I	and the last one is hats . so , over here too .
1	3I	wall , but i 'm sure that it will fit .
0	6B	or teaching people to be assistant cooks ?
1	3I	yeah , that 's - that could go - um -
2	6B	and then it cost money - it cost more money to put em down than to spay them .
2	3I	oh . very good .
1	3I	here we go good .
2	3I	yeah . but that 's more , like , baking stuff . yeah .
1	3I	beverages , right ?
0	3I	okay , bars of soap .
1	6B	yeah , yeah . not - not too bad .
1	3I	care , garden care -
1	3I	oh , that could be for -
1	3I	heavy cable . oo , tow ropes .
1	3I	that makes sense . bags of peat moss , which i still do n't know what is that .
1	3I	and maybe loose leaf paper and books up by the travel guides ?
2	3I	stuff at all . yeah , it 's okay . i - i - i think i really would rather have these things with the siding but it - we 're not gon na move em .
1	6B	yeah , you could certainly be -
1	6B	uh , bookkeeping classes . um , trunc i mean - i 'd say that the only two things that -
1	3I	i have no idea . i was trunc i guess i was thinking of - of - uh , physical fitness , but we do n't really have that category , so let 's just leave it there for now . we could always move it if we see something else that 's -
1	6B	but get rid of - which one did you suggest , the public news station ?
1	3I	ooh , yes ! as - as an accessory .
2	3I	buckets , i 'm gon na put back over here .
0	6B	note-takers .
1	3I	well face trunc face cream . soap .
2	6B	minimize the number of - hunting tags as - as opposed to increase the number - i 'm - cut it .
1	3I	yeah , we do n't really have milk anywhere else , so that 's fine .
0	3I	mm trunc we do n't really have anything . okay .
1	6B	very tricky .
2	3I	pre-cut wood . oh man
1	6B	yeah to - that 's true .
1	6B	yeah . okay , so those three stay . um , football equipment .
1	3I	oh , that 's what trunc good idea .
2	3I	we got the face trunc yeah , there is , yeah .
1	6B	yeah . like football equipment , maybe the families of the - on the football team or the booster club should raise money for that instead of the county .
1	6B	um . yeah .
1	3I	um - yeah .
1	3I	over by the -
1	3I	let 's - yeah .
1	3I	ooh ! shoelaces . that looks like a clothing supply to me , but not a -
0	6B	i 've never had one . i dunno .
0	3I	it 's on the end cap .
2	6B	additions . i would , too . yeah .
2	6B	that 's - i mean , it 's - trunc that would be important as far as , like , keeping a community feeling like a trunc community . but , uh -
2	6B	hhh does n't seem like a - like it needs to be a government thing .
2	6B	that 's how you make your money .
1	6B	okay . we have one more .
2	6B	are good . yeah . we still have our main cooks , right ? no . uh -
2	3I	trunc i think all those go - does n't matter .
2	3I	well , no , they have to be with our f-
1	6B	okay , we can come back to that . trunc k-
1	6B	that 's right . they do .
1	3I	and large cups . we had something like large cups . did n't we have , uh - ?
1	3I	yeah , yeah , by the hats . yeah . light jackets , yeah .
2	3I	that 's gon na be over here , but - but where over here ?
1	6B	that 's up for debate right now .
2	6B	it would - it would depend , i mean it would vary from one area to the next .
1	6B	actually , where you are there 's a great place . it 's called -
2	6B	i dunno . i do n't want - i do n't feel comfortable cutting the low-income programs .
2	6B	a taxi stop is just a - one more parking spot that does n't get charged for .
0	3I	oh , right . let 's see .
1	3I	near oatmeal ?
1	3I	refrigerator magnets ?
1	3I	refrigerator magnets ?
1	3I	refrigerator magnets .
2	6B	sugar - we should get rid of the sugar-free juice machine .
2	6B	they reproduce really - a lot .
1	3I	somewhere in that same aisle ?
2	6B	teacher certificates , i am absolutely - in fact , i 'm , uh , i 'm - i 'm all for , uh - for making sure that , uh -
1	3I	fish hooks ! boating supplies ?
2	3I	put em next to egg timers , i mean just - or - or next to the toilet trunc yeah , you often see that , just with paper goods and stuff .
2	6B	cut football -
2	6B	weed control . yay !
0	3I	egg timer . where was the magnetic - ?
0	3I	lower left .
2	3I	we can add to our clothing - clothing area , there . our hats and sweaters .
2	6B	and they have to cycle through them one after another .
2	6B	that 's the reason - one of the reasons i feel iffy about it . cuz i just feel like -
1	6B	okay , let 's cut that .
1	6B	let that go .
1	3I	yeah probably by cake mix .
1	6B	sounds nice to have .
2	3I	we do n't have a check stand here .
1	3I	no it 's fine .
0	6B	boating licenses .
0	6B	boating licenses .
2	6B	um , posting , you know those taxis only zones , and painting the curbs sometimes , and - ?
1	6B	yeah . boating licenses .
1	6B	yeah , i know .
1	6B	start out with the sugar-free juice machines .
1	3I	bars of soap . would you put - yeah , here ?
0	6B	we uh -
0	3I	small sticks -
1	6B	trunc or not necessarily prenatal . checkups which was on there - but just -
0	6B	subway system . trunc is it - ?
1	6B	cool . sounds good . those are the six . last but not least , infrastructure and licensing .
2	3I	well , this is miscellaneous , and then these are more specific , so i -
2	6B	publicly funded , but -
1	3I	egg trunc egg timers , so that 's more of a hardware thing . up by refrigerator magnets ? i think that 's a trunc i think that 's a good idea .
2	3I	tow ropes . trunc that 's with the fishing .
2	6B	oh , that would be fun !
1	3I	we are running out of space here .
0	3I	alright . boxes of doughnuts .
2	3I	our cold stuff would be -
1	6B	uh - i trunc i - yeah , i mean i - but - by the way , i 'm just sort of going through the list right now , and - uh - i do n't disagree with you .
2	3I	kinda makes sense .
1	3I	this could be with mousetraps , or -
0	6B	and i learned it from my - from my friends .
1	3I	beans .
0	3I	hm , no , but you 've got , like , storage , food stuff near the bottom , there .
0	6B	oh really ? oh .
1	3I	cushions for trunc deck chairs , okay .
1	6B	do n't know about you , but - um -
1	3I	okay . i 'm gon na put bagels across from donuts .
1	6B	alright . sounds good . so .
2	6B	but food bank seems like something that people donate .
0	6B	well maybe they 're all the same number . i guess they are .
1	3I	so this is going to be really similar to -
1	6B	chicken pox trunc now that i think of it , seems a little bit like , uh , do n't need that one .
1	6B	i do n't know bout it .
1	6B	poetry books , and then probably -
2	3I	sounds good . i 've got some thick sweaters so that 'll - those 'll go nice with the large vests . got ta get extra warm .
1	3I	yeah yeah . that siding 's .
0	6B	football and sugar free . we 've got , uh -
2	3I	sugar and ice cream .
2	6B	keep licensing most things . so like boating -
0	3I	kay . okay .
1	3I	what about with this stuff ?
1	3I	kay , face cream . hm , looks like it should go there .
1	6B	what can we trade off ? what can we trunc well , the hospital additions we can wait on .
1	6B	move to next column ?
1	6B	and neutering their cats .
1	6B	oh , i would say -
1	6B	job training programs . i think that 's important . chicken pox vaccinations . i trunc i think they can get it , i trunc i do n't really know , i should probably know . um -
1	6B	two birds with one s-
0	6B	that 's like safe streets .
1	3I	basements , or -
0	6B	if we 're -
0	3I	i dunno what - if they mean like , school supplies , which we kinda have down there , next to the duct tape .
2	6B	but , i think not building a wing in a hospital is -
0	6B	anyway , so yeah , they built t_b_t_ there . um -
2	6B	needle exchange you got ta have .
1	3I	half inch tubing . i think we 're over here again .
1	6B	hospital additions , interesting . bagel factory inspectors -
1	6B	by the county , rather .
1	6B	cut that .
2	3I	so heavy coats -
1	6B	well , maybe the dog catcher ? add that back ? so you do n't have stray dogs running around ?
0	3I	half inch tubing
0	6B	i do n't understand . is that like , uh - teaching you to become an assistant cook ?
2	6B	people who need it , it 's -
2	3I	yeah , these were the ones we 're walking for .
2	6B	that 's to encourage people to get together and be vigilant .
2	3I	yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
2	6B	maybe they 'll just bundle it into that .
1	3I	toothpaste , and stuff like - okay , this is buckets .
1	6B	yeah . food bank is keep . junior soccer league -
0	3I	um fishing net .
0	3I	weights -
1	3I	cuz here we have sugar . i - i 'd rather move the sugar with eggs , but i guess we 're not supposed to move those .
2	6B	that 's tough .
1	6B	the low hanging fruit for me is the sugar free juice machines .
2	3I	and then the shoelaces can be part of clothing .
0	6B	here it is .
2	3I	question is , heavy cable area , or the power cords down here ?
1	3I	alright . i 've got a couple liters of water here .
2	6B	okay . well let 's get rid of hunting tags .
1	3I	gardening stuff .
1	3I	probably here .
0	3I	hooks , nets , sticks -
1	3I	probably go with the boating supplies .
2	6B	oh god .
1	6B	and , i 'm a little confused what you repair on a flagpole other than repainting it .
2	6B	yeah . and it 's um - it is important .
0	3I	mint toothpaste .
0	3I	mint toothpaste .
0	3I	mint toothpaste .
0	3I	mint toothpaste .
0	3I	mint toothpaste .
0	3I	mint toothpaste .
0	3I	mint toothpaste .
1	3I	doughnuts .
0	6B	to go on education .
1	6B	or that all three of them .
2	3I	you 'd have to have a camera on that . that was n't a good idea .
2	3I	oh , that makes sense ! okay .
2	6B	yeah , absolutely . yeah .
1	3I	and - ah , heavy coats .
0	6B	public access station . yes , three .
1	6B	okay , flagpole repair and -
1	3I	stuff like that , yeah .
2	6B	yeah we 'll keep the licenses . so we 'll also keep the boating license .
1	6B	like komo and king and all those , those are privately owned , but they each have their own traffic .
2	6B	well if it 's that i could get rid of that . that would be alright with me . i would n't wan na get rid of k_u_o_w_ . uh .
1	6B	i think we 're going to trunc have to keep toxic waste disposal . that seems important .
2	6B	stray cat spaying . i - i do n't think so
1	3I	box of doughnuts , same place ?
1	3I	well , um i guess it trunc could go either here or here , no ?
1	6B	things that jump out at me -
1	6B	yes . i think so .
1	3I	yeah , how bout duct tape down there ?
1	3I	garage items , there you go . that 's a good .
1	3I	i would say near the back .
1	6B	well , should we start with education programs ?
2	3I	it 's so quiet in here .
2	6B	well , i trunc how about boys ' basketball and leave junior soccer ? it 's very popular now and -
1	3I	what do you think they are ? kitchen equipment ?
2	3I	box knives have something to do with - now , siding has more to do with -
1	6B	the reusable bag campaign . and again remember we do n't have to actually have to do this . they just want to hear us talking .
0	3I	uh , he 's been eating them since he was one .
0	6B	and treated .
1	6B	maybe we should , uh , pick - either pick a - a number right now -
1	6B	so , are we gon na x_ out football equipment ?
1	3I	uh , i 'd call that - that 's somehow a hardware-ish - well , unless it 's - yeah , it 's a hardware-ish thing .
1	3I	easy grab - what i would say was -
1	3I	yep right -
0	6B	oh , did we pick one in there already ? i was kidding about math tutors .
2	6B	uh , foodbank is very important item for public services .
2	3I	that 's pretty healthy . i 'll put it next to the eggs , cuz they kind of sound the same figs and eggs .
2	3I	and face cream ! something for the bathroom .
2	6B	food bank or soup kitchen .
2	6B	i think we could get rid of flagpole repair . you could get veterans groups or trunc or boy scout groups , or somebody to do it .
2	3I	i was thinking way up here . trunc put trunc start it up here with the personal . so heavy coats .
2	6B	you know . i - and i mean , that 's how it would trunc uh , that 's how it 'd go . i mean , you know .
1	3I	yeah . yeah , that 's a good call . yeah .
2	3I	breakfast stuff ? really ? the doughnuts cans of peas .
2	6B	yeah . although that 's always hard because -
1	6B	the cats are - yeah .
2	3I	yeah . then this could be boots and this is clothing .
0	3I	liters of water . liters .
2	6B	you know , under the , uh - under the trunc medical marijuana .
2	3I	maybe with the kitchen stuff .
0	3I	well i have socks .
0	6B	pre-natal checkups was - we put that with the chicken pox vaccination .
1	3I	a kitchen item .
0	3I	water -
0	3I	water .
0	3I	water .
1	3I	would you put them next to the toys or the travel guides and mousetraps ?
1	3I	bart - okay .
2	3I	alright , here 's a nother good one .
1	6B	okay . soup kitchens , obviously . have to keep that .
2	6B	well there 's certain things that are - absolutely must be done .
1	3I	alright tubing above duct tape .
1	3I	maybe - maybe up here , by refrigerator magnets .
1	3I	we 'll have to move it down .
1	3I	yeah . cake mix and -
1	3I	we 'll go with that .
1	3I	oh , very good . small axes . okay .
0	6B	oh , yeah , there it is right there .
2	3I	i 'm gon na put them right underneath the mouse traps
1	3I	ah , here .
1	3I	packaged to go .
0	6B	do they mean television , or trunc ? yeah .
1	6B	we 'll see -
1	6B	we 'll see .
1	6B	sex offender database . that seems important . and i think people would be upset if people cut it . um , veterans medical assistance ? i think that 's important .
1	6B	and weeds - well weeds - generally do n't kill people . sometimes controlling them kills people .
2	6B	it 's expensive .
2	3I	well , i used to use em for photography stuff . so - but this is not - that 's not - i think it would go with eggs .
1	3I	yeah . or trunc yeah , put em up there and they 're also kind of trunc close to the loose leaf paper and just paper products . light jackets . we can put that up with the clothing .
1	6B	see i 'm thinking most -
1	6B	so they can - they can - we can take that out .
1	6B	um . yes .
1	3I	so where do you think hats , then ?
1	6B	oh . okay . never mind then . maybe community news ads .
2	6B	yeah , something like that in a paid position . maybe that would be better to try to get a volunteer , kind of .
2	6B	but , it is illegal to buy it !
1	6B	yeah , probably true .
2	6B	i might be tempted - i were only gon na do two , i might be tempted to trunc take both of those .
0	6B	like a - like a - a community center ? where they would have - literature and handouts , like , for instance , voting pamphlets and things like that , you would get normally at a library ?
0	3I	i used to have , like , five of those . always lose them . beets would -
0	3I	like for hard boiled egg- ?
2	3I	yeah , yeah , sure ! yeah , yeah , yeah .
2	3I	trunc um . i guess .
1	6B	yeah , i would too
1	3I	with just miscellaneous stuff with the bags of peat moss and paper bags
1	3I	put it with the camping stuff ?
0	6B	budget .
1	3I	by the toilet paper . more paper goods .
1	3I	yeah , that could either be -
1	6B	that 's , uh , it 's probably cuttable .
2	3I	i do n't know how people shop .
2	3I	uh , next to the toilet paper ? or the bar of soap ?
1	3I	yay . yeah . bags of peat moss .
1	6B	i would say -
1	6B	probably need that , as well .
2	6B	reproductive ed , job training program , chicken pox vaccinations , invasive species removal , s_t_d_ education , toxic waste disposal . goodness , it 's gon na be hard to - do five . except for those bagel factory inspections .
2	6B	if we 're gon na keep stray cat spaying , we should probably keep kitten and puppy adoption .
1	3I	i 'd say there .
0	3I	cake mix , sugar -
0	6B	you have to fly it ?
1	3I	maybe by food items ?
1	3I	i 'm surprised there 's not tunafish on the list . sticks of butter .
1	3I	yeah probably .
2	6B	trunc yeah ! keep that .
1	3I	and then the cases of whiskey - ?
1	6B	do we agree ?
2	3I	they usually have shoelaces next to , like , the -
1	3I	consumables
1	3I	if i remember right , we had more , like , outdoorsy words ? so second - yeah , so like trunc second -
2	3I	oh , we 're bussing right though this sucker .
1	3I	and what 's going to go in the middle here ?
2	6B	definitely need that one . okay soup kitchens . so d-
1	6B	the sound - the like - the link light rail is already kind of a subway .
1	3I	so we get to decide .
0	6B	math tutors , assistant cooks , sex ed. , custodians , speech therapy , football equipment -
1	3I	boating supplies . mm-hmm .
1	3I	i think behind would be fine .
1	3I	i think this is fine , in the middle .
1	6B	we were gon na get rid of the additional bus stops .
2	6B	i thought there was another one .
1	3I	trunc bars of soap .
1	3I	right . right .
1	6B	right , right .
2	3I	we were limited by -
2	6B	computerized blocking sled . then i do n't think they need that .
2	3I	finally got something to go with them .
1	6B	uh , i think - i think you 're right . i think we can cut -
2	6B	unfortunately . i mean i know that 's a job for those people . i mean but some of this is jobs for everybody and we just -
2	6B	unless we cut -
2	6B	if it gets to be really bad - but i - that 's like , if i have to - well -
2	6B	i think - they 're already planning on cutting the bus stops . i really do n't want them to - um -
1	6B	special ed teachers , i think that 's really important .
1	6B	okay , so we 've gotten rid of one in each category . do we want to go for a second ?
0	3I	were - are trunc were we missing items from our lists ? okay .
0	3I	uh , toys .
1	6B	the - what about this instead ? or - poetry books and cooking classes was it ?
1	3I	which to me indicates a bulk item , that 's non-perishable so i would put it by the dried figs .
1	3I	no , here 's toilet paper , maybe -
2	3I	or we could put it below here . i do n't remember -
1	3I	maybe next -
0	3I	you think this is , like , a tiny portable one ?
1	3I	eggs and sticks of trunc yeah , that 's dairy .
2	6B	oh . where are the girls ?
2	3I	well , i suppose we could put it next to mousetraps .
1	3I	or - this sh-
1	6B	i do n't know if that 's making it too personal .
1	6B	i do n't think that 's important .
1	3I	oh socks and shoe laces and boots .
2	3I	which could be on this side , too , remember ?
1	3I	could either i would think either go down here by some of the dry foods , or , like , up -
1	3I	that would be - yeah .
1	3I	yeah , there you go . yep .
2	3I	so , useful inedible , useless inedible .
2	6B	oh , i assume this is a city department , right ? this is - we 're - we 're essentially working for a city . i think an acting coach is trunc something that could be cut .
1	3I	probably put it by the small axes .
1	3I	so , wetsuits , tow ropes , fish hooks -
2	3I	they did n't leave us any this time .
1	6B	cuz weed control can go under invasive - invasive trunc species .
1	3I	well , we 've got food over here . let 's put em with the eggs .
1	3I	trunc pre-cut wood here , maybe ?
1	6B	class ?
2	3I	yeah , why not ? right here .
1	3I	i think maybe opposite - over here . because we have n't really got another aisle for it . we do n't want em with sugar and cake mixes if we do n't - can help it . do we ?
2	6B	yeah , those are important to . so i guess if anything we 'd have to cut like licenses . cuz everything is like important , you know ?
2	3I	you think ? kay .
0	6B	most strongly is -
1	6B	yeah , trunc let 's keep those . we 're probably gon na keep , like , everything .
1	3I	yeah , that would make sense to go there .
1	3I	they could fit there .
1	3I	yeah . think here ?
2	3I	yeah , it does . okay , so now we 've got clothing and household items . and -
1	3I	next to the toothpaste ?
2	3I	but buckets .
2	3I	ah , that 's the trick .
2	6B	but , you know - against -
1	6B	then that wo n't have to be as much of a -
2	3I	alright . so i 've got socks next . um . socks are gon na go up in the clothing aisle . so near the heavy coats and shoe laces and hats and stuff .
1	3I	it 's gon na be opposite the other clothes cuz we 're gon na run out of space . and my heavy coats are gon na be there . oh , and lucky me .
1	3I	maybe up here , with all - we 've got a lotta fishing .
1	3I	yeah , i 'd stick it with trunc our box stuff .
1	6B	right . okay well that 'll trunc yeah .
1	6B	trunc probably .
1	3I	okay . yeah . okay .
1	6B	and music teachers are important .
2	6B	cuz if you know how to cook then you do n't have to go to mcdonald 's .
1	3I	see , is there a bathroom - ? oh , there 's soap .
1	6B	way it works within the system to keep kids in - school . mm .
2	3I	but maybe it 's good to have the tools kind of in one area .
0	6B	teaching people - it 's probably teaching people how to -
2	3I	i 've got some books . those 'll go great with uh travel guides . in like the literature section maybe there , up above the loose leaf paper .
0	3I	i have some large vests .
0	6B	uh , toxic waste disposal .
1	6B	football - , that 's one . football equipment .
0	6B	governors of this city - i know that 's the wrong word . we 'll go with mayors , co-mayors .
1	3I	so food looks like it 's over here on this side .
1	3I	like having that makes me think it has to do something with , like a wave down flag , or -
2	6B	i - think that 's important .
1	3I	up here ?
1	3I	up here ?
1	3I	it 's true .
1	6B	it 's true .
1	3I	it 's true .
1	6B	it 's true .
1	3I	it 's true .
1	6B	it 's true .
2	6B	who else is gon na clean up ? cuz no one cleans up after themselves . um , speech therapy ?
0	6B	yeah , fishing licenses .
1	6B	oh what about junior soccer league ?
1	3I	alright , then we have jackets . do we have any clothing items up here at all ?
1	3I	it 's an odd item .
2	6B	like triple a_ and private companies so
2	3I	bags of peat moss , not sustainable , five pound weights , and heavy cable .
1	6B	maybe - cut -
0	3I	egg trunc oh , here we are with egg timers once again .
1	6B	available . yeah .
1	3I	i do n't know . we can put those down kind of in the weird stuff that need a -
2	6B	i know . i think assistant cooks can be cut . trunc in my opinion .
1	6B	we do n't have to decide on a subway system , or not a subway system .
1	3I	yeah , i 'm gon na put it - don'tcha think -
1	3I	and then was it boxes of donuts ?
2	6B	you could get rid of towing services . we can keep it privatized .
1	3I	i feel like , on this - ?
1	3I	because you could take a flag camping , if you would like ,
1	3I	unless we go over here and put that with .
0	6B	it 's trunc right next to the - the bus and the train station .
0	6B	not even in a high density area .
1	3I	yeah . trunc i think that 's probably good .
1	3I	sugar ! sugar sugar and ice cream and packages of cookies . that 's where all the kids are gon na hang out , right up there .
1	6B	do we get to plan that ? we have to -
1	3I	do we feel like - ?
2	6B	grade three , then none of them are trunc no s-
0	3I	or was that the tow rope ?
2	6B	um , well here . i think the boys ' basketball club . they do n't have a girls ' anything .
2	6B	is there anything in the first column that you think should go ? i - i honed in on acting coaches .
0	3I	and we have hats . let 's see , are there any other clothing items here that would -
1	6B	so , which ones do you wan na cut for sure ?
1	6B	invasive species removal and i think weed control overlap , so - and i think weed control does less . and so i think we could get rid of trunc is that three ?
1	3I	we just do , uh , one at a time , then ?
1	3I	because they are all disposable type household items .
2	6B	job training programs , chicken pox vaccinations - i 'm a big vaccination believer .
1	3I	here - ?
0	6B	massage certificates . flag pole repair ,
1	3I	my inclination would be to put it toward -
2	6B	the music teachers need to go .
0	3I	processed food .
1	3I	um , i think that -
3	6B	no , if you 're gon na leave in football , we need poetry .
0	6B	be assistant cooks , or at least employing people .
2	6B	at the clinics .
2	3I	they belong together . pre-cut wood .
1	3I	power cords . okay , i agree with that .
0	3I	most - i act - and just thinking of the store . t_n_c_ in bainbridge - you know , you 've got the pet food -
1	3I	home improvement , you think ?
2	3I	here , i 'm just gon na stick this , like -
2	6B	and it does n't actually because people are so -
0	6B	i did n't know that they gave any .
2	3I	well , now i have pre-cut wood , so -
1	3I	paper and scissors ?
1	3I	interesting um -
1	3I	trunc tow ropes .
1	3I	with uh -
1	3I	very nice .
1	3I	yeah , let 's put it here .
0	6B	like , a - a show ? like -
1	3I	things that you would use around - yeah .
1	6B	sounds good . poetry books ?
1	6B	and if we 're looking at flag pole repair -
1	6B	like category by category or - ?
1	3I	mint toothpaste with the face cream , and tweezers , and toilet paper ?
1	3I	i guess - yeah , we can put on .
1	6B	mm . to me that seems like -
0	3I	socks . where -
2	6B	exactly . exactly .
1	6B	sound good ?
2	6B	and the things you really ca n't do on your own trunc or at home .
1	6B	of items . on a list , then we can see if we can make the others fit it .
1	3I	scissors . let 's put that with the loose leaf paper .
2	6B	i mean every time someone gets a license they are paying for it .
1	6B	yeah , no one uses government towing services . that 's silly .
1	6B	i would -
1	3I	i would .
0	6B	that seem really extraneous .
1	3I	this seems to be more personal , like toys and travel guides .
1	3I	in a real grocery store , you would n't have soybeans and bagels together .
1	3I	with the sticks and the axe and - but not with siding oh gosh
1	3I	space right here ?
1	3I	oh , there 's -
1	3I	down ? kay .
1	3I	do we wan na put it next to ice cream ?
1	3I	was trunc oh , refrigerator magnets . kind of it - well - maybe not .
1	3I	also over here , do you think ?
1	3I	and bags of peat moss , probably with -
1	3I	okay . i 'll just put it next to the shoelace .
2	6B	so we 're cutting - we 're cutting the government veterinary hospital .
1	3I	there - there you go .
1	3I	that does n't seem to go anywhere . liters of water .
1	3I	g of peet moss , that sounds like a outdoor gardening and household -
1	3I	sure . yeah . kinda small -
1	3I	you put that ?
2	3I	so if we move it up here -
2	6B	yeah . trunc that 's already funded , right ?
1	3I	i 'm good too . we 're done .
0	6B	taxi stops , fishing licenses -
1	3I	this looks like , uh , aisle one .
1	6B	have we talked about all of em ? i guess - pothole maintenance you got ta have .
0	6B	okay so we only have to do one cuz that 's all we did before .
2	6B	i feel like it 's important . yeah , i -
1	6B	maybe hospital additions ? i mean , that 's so vague , i do n't really know what that means , so -
2	6B	effort to support people trunc by providing the food bank . i just -
1	6B	oh ! was poetry books that one we were gon na go back to ?
1	3I	oh , that 's gon na be over here somewhere .
0	6B	what is community news and ads ?
2	6B	well , neighbors could be helping in a time of budget , so yeah , let 's get rid of neighborhood watch support .
1	6B	i think - yeah , i think so . i think that 's important . yeah .
0	6B	well there 's - there 's the seattle channel . there 's the king county channel . there 's the -
0	3I	do we have other clothing up here ? no .
0	3I	here you go .
2	6B	i think we do n't need a trunc additional bus stops . i mean -
2	6B	yeah , because it brought money in . we need to keep the potholes maintained .
1	3I	as a processed item . but still .
1	3I	um , small axes maybe here ?
0	6B	so we could still get rid of assistant cooks , get rid of uh , football equipment , get rid of acting coaches , poetry books .
1	3I	uh , but not -
1	3I	now , we 'd want this by the front door .
2	6B	well , except trunc then if - i was like thinking that the cat spaying is public . they probably need -
1	3I	oh yeah , bars of soap should be up by -
1	6B	alright . alright .
1	3I	do trunc wan na do -
1	3I	um - yeah , on that first aisle somewhere .
0	6B	four .
0	6B	four -
0	3I	okay . got ta grab some more .
1	6B	so , now let 's go -
1	6B	could that be the second from the bottom ? or were you thinking something else ?
0	6B	so the hospital additions , bagels -
2	6B	if it 's really - if it 's really a budget , you could get volunteers , or they could do some themselves .
2	3I	yes , well , stuff to drink is just kind of a specialty - try this one down here .
1	6B	it 's kind of a non-profit thing . i do n't know .
2	6B	i mean sex ed .
2	3I	so , what i would do is i would take backpacks out .
1	3I	yeah . there were toys . i do n't remember that much else to go with toys .
2	3I	dried figs are n't fresh . but -
1	3I	i do n't know , either here or trunc here . i 'm not sure .
2	3I	yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah .
1	6B	access - public access station , i think .
2	6B	would become less essential .
1	6B	yeah , so if we take out the juice machines and football we 've done it .
1	6B	that - yeah . oh all that stuff 's important .
1	3I	well i can hold on to it , and we can -
2	3I	and rolls of duct tape would go with this stuff here .
1	3I	that makes sense . it 's outdoor home items .
1	6B	yeah , i do n't honestly feel that strongly about it .
2	6B	and it 's not that i do n't value poetry books , but we 're saving money , so we can save a hundred buck .
1	3I	mm-kay . empty plastic jugs .
2	6B	bazillions of little churches that got together .
1	3I	shoelaces go by socks .
2	3I	now , see , the ice cream is trunc way up there .
1	3I	loose-leaf paper . so we wan na put that - yeah .
1	6B	awhile .
0	6B	like , um -
0	6B	, job training , chicken pox vaccination , invasive species , s_t_d_ educatio-
1	3I	i trunc i would put that - trunc one of these two rows .
1	3I	alright . got some large cups next . so those 'll probably go in uh -
1	3I	outdoor - outdoor stuff .
1	3I	it 's our it 's our store we could put the whisky by the -
1	6B	i think that if - that should stay probably if - especially if we 're gon na keep the special ed .
1	3I	if there 's nothing that 's gon na be well -
2	3I	there 's probably gon na be bread .
1	6B	otherwise they 're gon na get euthanized , right ?
1	3I	oh . cases of whiskey .
2	3I	paper bags . i say they go to carry lunch to work in , so put em near that . how bout the canvas bags ? grocery shopping , and therefore in the same area ?
2	6B	music teachers are more essential than the sugar-free juice machines .
2	3I	they have no garden stuff ? in the northwest , they have no garden stuff ?
2	6B	uh , to keep , uh , vermin down .
1	3I	fill the boxes of donuts right into the -
1	6B	depending on what the need is , for the community .
1	3I	my inclination is to put it right next to the toothpaste .
1	6B	the news ads and keep the station . and then they can have , like , a thing where they show the news . okay . teaching certificates . gon na stay . yeah .
0	3I	i 'm trying really hard to avoid that noise . okay , pre-cut wood .
0	3I	okay , we 're done , heather .
1	3I	you think ?
1	3I	hm just in case some of this comes in , i think i 'm gon na put it right trunc like , bout here ?
1	6B	yeah . let 's cut one . yeah , at least one .
0	3I	um , cans of peas .
0	3I	um , scissors ?
0	6B	yeah . i do n't know what that -
1	3I	fleece lined boots with hats , and vests , and socks ?
1	3I	chocolate bars , grab and go ?
1	3I	dairy . these two trunc yeah .
2	6B	yeah . yeah , now i think about it , i mean -
0	3I	uh . i -
0	3I	okay , so power cords -
2	6B	their mothers can teach them , books can teach them .
1	3I	wood product with them ?
0	3I	uh-huh what is that ?
0	6B	um . public health and safety .
0	6B	um , public health and safety .
2	6B	well in seattle we all more or less doing it .
2	3I	with the chocolate obvious .
2	3I	it - yeah , it depends .
1	6B	one way or the other . it 'll be kept over there .
0	6B	veterinary
2	3I	pre-cut wood should also go over here .
0	6B	so , down to the last four . so we have two more to go .
1	6B	right . that makes sense .
1	6B	so now we 're gon na go to the next one . so we definitely hafta get rid of two .
1	6B	why do n't we like , cut one , and then if we need to go back trunc
0	3I	empty plastic -
0	3I	empty plastic -
1	3I	well - yeah , we can take the - yeah . there you go .
2	3I	with the pet food ? what ? yeah .
2	3I	yeah ! trunc no , that 's a good idea ! i like that idea . i 'm gon na put that here .
2	6B	since - since neither one of us knows what a public access station is , i think we could probably cut it . unless somebody can tell us what it is .
0	3I	um , shoelaces ?
2	6B	i 'm gon na take our - our answers and - over to the city council and -
1	6B	you think so ?
1	3I	you think so ?
1	6B	you think so ?
1	6B	so ! you wan na go to the next column ? public health and safety . uh .
2	3I	we 're running out of room . we 'd have to put it here . or here .
2	6B	now , i forgot we 'd agreed on that . i 'm still not sure what the city 's doing , or the county 's doing with taxi stops , but - um - yeah , towing services is - can go first .
1	6B	but yeah , the -
1	3I	with the - yeah .
2	3I	i - i thought it was whatever - i wish - it 's - tweezers and face cream should go together . we 're gon na do that .
0	6B	food banks are for people for like -
1	6B	mm-hmm . i think we could . -
0	3I	and i have hats , loose-leaf paper , and egg timers .
1	3I	i mean , it 's kind of - yeah .
2	3I	i dunno . or maybe with outdoors stuff cuz if you 're like gon na go somewhere ?
0	6B	uh , i dunno . sesame street versus -
1	6B	if the spaying does good - as - as much as it does -
2	6B	it should be part of sex ed .
1	3I	next to the box knives ?
1	3I	at fred meyer they 'd have it in - in this one .
1	6B	i mean , what would happen without - yeah .
0	3I	hhh , let 's see -
1	3I	can get all of your fire lighting needs taken care of .
0	3I	paper , so -
1	3I	but those go with -
1	3I	that 's - good question .
1	6B	sure . we 'll - we 'll let a private one take over .
1	6B	private sector can do that , just fine .
1	6B	uh , fishing licenses trunc well , so , how much are we up at ?
2	6B	you have to have invasive species removal , or they just take over .
1	6B	so that hasta be a pretty good -
2	6B	could n't the football stadium people take care of their own upkeep ?
2	6B	and let everybody do their own weed control ?
1	3I	how bout next to toys ?
1	3I	oh ! definitely a cold weather item .
2	3I	yeah , in a real grocery store they 'd be in the same aisle .
1	6B	i tend to like -
1	6B	yeah . i - i agree .
1	3I	with the clothes ? where 's the - ? yeah . the heavy coats . and then , dried figs . see , do we have anything else like that ? this stuff is all dry .
1	3I	what would you think about putting them between the siding and the cushions ?
1	3I	let 's put it with that stuff . huh .
2	3I	we could also just make it a really confusing store , so that - then people would be , like , looking for one thing and then you find something else .
1	6B	what would you cut ?
2	3I	the bottles of trunc bottles of juice goes next to sticks of butter .
2	6B	taxi stops . meh .
1	3I	should we put it in the middle ?
0	6B	access station ?
0	6B	access station -
0	6B	i have no idea what that is .
1	6B	yeah . so let trunc so trunc so minimally one could fold one into the other and cut some budget .
1	6B	oh , i see , i see .
1	3I	box knives ? yeah , that sounds dandy . dried figs . next to -
1	6B	that 's helpful .
2	3I	rolls of duct tape . this got ta be over here someplace .
1	3I	down here by the tubing and stuff ?
1	6B	yeah . i mean trunc they 're -
1	3I	gas-powered cookstoves over here ? or should we do it -
1	6B	yeah , that 's true
2	3I	i 'll put those where the socks . cuz you got ta kinda wear those together , so .
1	3I	uh , that does not require refrigeration , and we have a whole -
0	3I	kind of a -
0	6B	okay . so how many do we have from there ?
0	6B	food bak , junior soccer league kitten and puppy adoption -
2	6B	because those are n't really -
1	3I	things like that ?
1	3I	sorts of stuff . empty plastic jugs . that looks like we need a recycling bin , but we do n't have one .
2	6B	private . i 'm - i 'm just - the trunc the list is bizarre !
2	3I	or food .
1	6B	yeah , tattoo artist licenses .
3	6B	uh - that is - i do n't know what that is , but it seems terrible .
2	6B	yeah . how many - how many , like , feral dogs and cats are there ?
1	6B	but they do use public facilities .
2	6B	i know . um .
1	6B	i feel okay about that .
1	6B	but we 're keeping poetry books , right ?
2	6B	and we do n't need to campaign over it anymore .
2	6B	trunc seems like the same thing .
0	6B	the news .
1	3I	we could do them there , that 's a big -
1	6B	yeah , alright . now we 're gon na look for two over here .
0	6B	uh , j_d_s_ , jewish day school .
2	6B	special ed teacher , seems important .
2	6B	department . i mean they 'd be done in the same place i would think . or else this and this would be the same place .
2	6B	is called .
1	3I	course then we have all , like , our -
1	3I	small saws . oh good ! more material for our -
0	6B	pre-natal check-up , weed -
0	3I	it 's close to both .
1	3I	yeah . people come in and grab it quick .
2	6B	you sound like you are very opposed to sugar-free juices .
2	3I	so yeah , definitely food over here . that looks like the chilled items side .
2	6B	no . if we keep the stray cat spaying -
2	6B	weed control and invasive species removal appear to be the same thing . what if we cut the weed control , and just left the invasive species removal ?
1	6B	we do n't know how many kids there are . we do n't know how many -
1	3I	uh , trunc trunc do these ? yeah .
2	3I	we can call it done .
1	6B	is this - is the county , and city - i mean -
1	3I	okay , how far down ?
1	3I	yeah , so they would be -
2	6B	how many bagel factories are there ?
1	3I	maybe next to boating supplies ?
1	3I	so , like , this makes sense .
1	3I	what about , like , toiletry stuff ? i was thinking here , but -
1	3I	could be the top .
0	6B	and they did n't put , um -
1	6B	well , then taxi stops ?
1	3I	cuz then we could put the -
0	3I	the trunc
1	3I	would you mind here ?
1	6B	oh , i 'd want to get rid of the hunting license , the fishing licenses -
2	6B	i do n't know if we should have some trunc public money in that so much .
0	6B	she switched to something -
3	6B	they 're getting run out by like all these ride share programs anyway . which are so much better because taxis are creepy . and they 're expensive as hell .
1	3I	this is outdoorsy . but , this is , like , on the - this is , like , the outside stuff , and this is , like , the tools , or whatever . i do n't know .
1	6B	what 's the easiest one to look at first ?
1	6B	what 's the easiest one to look at first ?
2	3I	half-inch tubing . i feel like that should all go in the same area .
0	3I	so we 're starting to see some -
1	6B	trunc nice . do you still attend ?
0	3I	socks .
0	3I	socks .
0	3I	socks .
0	3I	socks .
0	3I	socks .
0	3I	socks .
0	3I	socks .
0	3I	socks .
0	3I	socks .
0	3I	socks .
0	3I	socks .
0	3I	socks !
0	3I	socks .
0	3I	socks .
0	3I	socks .
1	3I	my inclination is to put them next to the large vests .
1	3I	put it with the donuts and -
1	3I	fish hooks . yes ! fish hooks .
1	3I	everywhere .
1	3I	well , we have buckets there , so we have containers in the sort of camping and outdoor-ware section .
2	3I	these guys should go together . yeah , that would be good .
2	3I	i 'm going to put my bars of soap -
1	3I	tow ropes . can we fit that over here ? next to -
1	6B	um . hm . interesting . neighborhood watch support .
2	6B	is that more important than football stadium upkeep ?
1	6B	so , probably not for that one . um -
1	6B	and even -
2	6B	your task is to decide .
2	3I	oh , okay . well , maybe it 's in this catch-all , the trunc sundries , cuz trunc you need -
1	3I	yeah , the flow of traffic .
2	3I	maybe . well , it 's - but it 's also kinda clothes . and we do n't really have a clothes section yet .
0	6B	i - i do n't know .
0	6B	okay . so , we picked one from each column .
1	3I	yeah , maybe up by the boating supplies too , yeah .
1	3I	so the outdoor or the -
0	3I	wet suits .
1	6B	what about the reusable bag campaign ?
0	6B	yeah . i mean -
1	6B	and so okay . yeah . okay .
3	3I	there just needs to be an area that can be dedicated to clothing , wherever we decide .
2	6B	let 's just go left to right .
1	3I	yeah , we put it with fishing .
1	3I	let 's see , maybe by the bundles of sticks ?
1	6B	maybe we 're not fast enough .
1	6B	chicken pox vaccinations ? yes .
1	3I	if they were raisins they should be just completely left alone .
1	3I	oh ! we could . okay , let 's do that .
1	6B	maybe we can cut half .
0	3I	oh . what do you use liters of water for ? people buy em for drinking water , do n't they ?
2	6B	they may forgive us . i was wondering - there 's like four things for animals . stray cats , trunc kitten and puppy adoption , dog catcher , and then veterinary hospital .
1	6B	i save them when i 'm in a trunc when i 'm in a jurisdiction that does n't have -
1	3I	above it maybe .
1	6B	that goes with the , uh , egg farm regulations and -
2	6B	in order to have , say -
1	6B	i do n't - like , it sounds more like a - it sounds like a high school class , or trunc well , i guess you just do n't fund it cuz you 'd have to get someone .
1	6B	okay . so trunc yeah those can be - those can be merged .
2	6B	and it only means it gets , you know , a little old .
1	6B	yeah . i think so too .
1	6B	yeah , i think so too .
1	3I	yeah , i think so too .
2	6B	frankly , i just think it - yeah , it trunc it does n't - people can be creeps and not be in this database . they could be uncaught sex offenders , or sex offenders waiting to happen . i -
0	3I	boating supplies . eh .
1	6B	let 's go on to public health .
2	6B	for public health and safety . even though - you know - in a way - keep kids interested in -
2	3I	i say trunc it 's be somewhere over here . that 's where i would put it too .
1	3I	um . bags of peat moss . that -
1	6B	sugar free - and uh , what was the other one ?
1	6B	mm . yeah , i agree .
0	6B	and it was , yeah , gon na be and was -
2	6B	i mean the prenatal check ups are pretty important .
1	3I	well , that would be okay with me .
2	6B	the reusable - trunc well , a_ the voters did not reject it -
0	3I	mm . trunc maybe -
1	3I	in case of more specific items .
0	6B	what was the fourth one ?
1	6B	do you agree ?
1	6B	right , and trunc the feds will always be in it too .
1	3I	we - well , this column - this row needs more stuff in it , so this might be kind of dairy and bakery or something like that .
2	6B	but it 's - , again , it 's what can they substitute , what can they do on their own by going to a library or something ? well , they can read poetry on their own .
0	6B	i took - took notes for the disability services people .
1	3I	possibly , like in this area ?
2	3I	because i do n't think there were any other art supplies , i would put scissors with art supplies .
2	3I	bags of peat moss . gardening . maybe way down here .
0	6B	trunc trunc no . trunc about two thousand .
1	6B	i would think it would be the same thing as a license .
0	3I	yeah , they did . they did . so we 've got all the clothing .
1	6B	the ones we we 're were additional bus stops , tattoo artist licenses -
2	3I	outdoor type , okay .
0	3I	um , pre-cut wood .
1	3I	maybe somewhere down here .
1	6B	poetry books ? yeah . special ed teachers sounds really important .
1	3I	oh . um i mean i guess these go . what kind of cups are these ?
1	3I	over here ? i 'm thinking hardware-type buckets . yeah .
2	3I	on the other hand , i 'm not sure i would put them right with the pet food .
2	3I	but trunc yeah . but you had like - yeah .
1	3I	wetsuits would go up here .
1	3I	egg timers would be with the - the -
2	6B	population . and so , like , if i personally was on a budget committee i would probably look to see what -
0	6B	if um -
1	6B	that sounds good , so - we 've killed one in the first two -
1	3I	sure . yeah yeah .
0	3I	is that - ?
2	3I	we squeeze that in there .
1	3I	where 'd we put the empty things ?
2	6B	but i think the m-
1	3I	for maybe -
1	3I	uh , like next to -
2	6B	so this sex ed . is gon na be for the kids . this reproductive education is for like -
1	3I	no , it would - it 'd be by cookies and stuff , but we filled up that .
1	3I	we do n't have anything over here .
2	6B	or weed control .
1	3I	five-pound weights ? ! we do n't have workout areas . maybe next to the toys ?
0	6B	so we 're gon na get rid of football station - stadium upkeep and the public news station .
2	3I	though we only have , like , a few things left . egg timers .
1	6B	i do n't know maybe .
2	6B	you have to have those yeah , that 's four ! yeah . sixteen of them . alright . they 're done !
1	3I	sure . sounds great .
2	3I	so i 'm gon na put some with the sidings . wood siding maybe .
0	6B	custodians .
0	6B	custodians .
0	6B	custodians .
1	3I	yeah . cool .
1	3I	our - yes .
2	3I	i 'll put it up here with the empty plastic bags with refrigerator magnets .
1	3I	chocolate bars next to cake mix ?
0	6B	oh , i do n't really know how those systems work .
2	6B	s_t_d_ education you pretty much have to have . toxic waste disposal you pretty much have to have .
1	6B	and dog catcher maybe ?
1	6B	which of these is not like the other for you ?
0	3I	travel guides . shoelaces .
1	3I	large vests are clothes .
1	3I	look at -
0	3I	okay , electric heaters . do we have a stove up there , or - we have -
2	3I	way better up there .
1	3I	oops . boxes of doughnuts .
2	6B	well my son played soccer . yeah .
0	6B	a license then they 're not allowed to do the boating or the tattooing .
1	3I	it 's okay .
2	3I	backpacks should go there too then .
1	6B	and i ca n't see why s_t_d_ education ca n't be put into trunc reproductive education , bu we can - i mean - trunc yeah , but we ca n't be combining . we 're cutting .
1	3I	okay books of matches with your camping ?
1	3I	yeah . cuz these all kinda would group around mouse traps , right ?
1	3I	okay trunc where 's clothes ?
0	6B	subway system ?
0	6B	subway system .
0	6B	subway system .
0	6B	subway system .
0	6B	subway system .
0	6B	subway system .
1	6B	care . i do n't know . vet -
1	6B	that 's yeah . soccer , basketball , football .
1	3I	i mean we should put clothes down here .
0	6B	uh , dog catcher -
2	6B	personally .
1	6B	each category , so - f-
1	3I	do we wan na s-
0	3I	now we got some dried figs .
1	6B	or if maybe it 's a bunch of people 's full time jobs . i dunno .
2	3I	yeah - but then eggs and butter are by each other in the store .
2	6B	for blind students or trunc yeah . yeah . yeah .
1	3I	if it was n't mint , we 'd have to put it over here . .
0	6B	we decided to keep the licensing as well . tattoo artist , boating licenses .
1	6B	i think that 's -
1	6B	i think that 's -
1	3I	sure . mm-hm mm-hm .
2	6B	category . i do n't know .
0	6B	hospital additions . bagel factory .
2	6B	uh - you know , you 're - yeah , i know trunc there 's a problem with , uh , walnut trees , and with , um -
1	3I	do you think i should put it here or here ? sorry , what ?
1	6B	are probably good .
1	3I	yeah . maybe it goes in here somewhere . trunc where do you think ?
1	6B	put up there , yeah .
3	3I	shoe laces . you know what ? i find when i go - yeah , oh good . cuz i find when i go into a store , a lot of times shoelaces are off in some little miscellaneous section with all those things hanging on the wall .
1	6B	that something extra -
2	3I	but buckets , depends - i mean , buckets , you use a lot outside .
1	6B	like it 's - it 's - it 's -it 's -
2	3I	uh , i 'm gon na put my dried figs next to the soybeans .
0	6B	three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten -
0	3I	tow rope-y things .
1	3I	okay . so then , does this look like outdoor slash , like home improvement-y type stuff ? and then -
0	3I	half inch tubing , bags of peat moss .
1	3I	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah .
1	3I	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah .
1	6B	yeah , maybe it 's , like , postings about things that are going on in the community ?
0	6B	like a needle recycling program ?
2	3I	this is a space , right ?
1	6B	i - i would trunc i would think that it was already existing , so i 'd say that 's probably important to , like , keep it up . hunting tags ? i do n't know what a hunting tag is .
1	3I	like that ?
2	3I	i would say kitchen-y stuff , but -
1	3I	household trunc that would be household s-
1	3I	that 's the hardware section .
2	6B	um . axe the taxi stops . i 'm not every sure what the city is doing .
0	3I	and the large vests .
1	3I	maybe above ? cuz i trunc i - i do n't know . yeah . books of matches .
1	6B	well , we could add back .
2	3I	beets . so this is produce , so should we put it maybe on this side of - ?
1	3I	and here we got , uh , pouches of oatmeal , which is food .
1	3I	uh-oh .
2	6B	it 's - i know . people are doing pretty good .
1	6B	yeah . pothole maintenance .
1	3I	although it could belong in other places .
1	3I	yeah . well , it can go - trunc well - i dunno . some things are just not in their place . do you wan na take one ? starts us off ?
1	6B	alright , then we got infrastructure and licensing .
1	3I	scissors - depends on what kinda trunc shoelaces .
2	3I	and siding is , you know , construction related . that kinda looks -
1	6B	sugar-free machi-
1	3I	uh , near refrigerator magnets .
1	6B	i mean , maybe it 's not the same trunc kinda program - maybe people like these programs , but -
2	6B	well , i trunc i could cut the veterinary hospital probably .
0	6B	assistant -
0	3I	soybeans , um -
1	6B	let 's find what we - we definitely do n't think we can afford to cut , at least one or two items from each .
1	6B	this is true , but looking at the other options - alright , um -
1	6B	and all your old pest chemicals that you 're not supposed to use anymore . you take em down there .
1	3I	i saw some - some , right here .
2	6B	i do n't think we can remove any of those , actually . reproductive education i 'd put on the line , because it 's - it 's - it 's - it 's not necessary -
1	3I	um . maybe a - patriotic bonfire . um . near the flags and boating supplies .
2	3I	we knew this to begin with .
0	6B	cut more . so - below are departments that are decide which expense you must choose the same number of items from each department .
1	3I	oh , and canvas bags might go there too .
2	6B	at trunc start with two . two from each , yeah .
1	3I	oh , we could have it up before the toys . we want it down here by mousetraps . alright , i put it down here and then we can put something in between is we need to .
0	6B	public health and safety . reproductive education .
0	6B	public health and safety . reproductive education .
1	6B	i think we could -
2	3I	okay . i 'm putting it right here , too .
2	3I	there 's something else that should be there . nother legume that we do n't have .
1	3I	trunc , trunc sure . i do n't know .
1	6B	yeah . um , a dog catcher -
1	3I	there , or there ?
2	6B	and the football stadium - upkeep .
1	3I	so above mouse traps we have the small saws and the small axes .
1	6B	i too .
2	6B	yes they are . we did not trunc cut a whole lot here .
1	6B	i mean , we have the stray cat spaying .
1	3I	can we do two sides to each ?
2	6B	yeah . yeah , it seems like a good service to have okay , so we have five there . um , sugar free juice machines .
1	3I	i do n't think it matters where those go .
2	6B	well , like , trunc uh , let 's - let 's - again , this is a hypothetical .
2	6B	yeah . which trunc it says for dogs . i 'm just - i 'm hoping they would also do -
1	3I	bagels , i think that 's an easier solution .
1	6B	yeah towing services .
1	3I	we can do it later .
1	3I	well , what about somewhere in here ?
1	3I	over here someplace , huh ?
1	6B	trunc actually .
1	3I	yeah , the electric heaters .
1	3I	cooking - pouches of oatmeal .
1	3I	could do it up at the very top . okay .
1	6B	adults who do n't know how to do it .
1	3I	next to the mousetraps ?
0	6B	prenatal check-ups
1	3I	oh , i guess we can put em right there .
0	3I	matches . buckets .
1	3I	we have n't filled up that aisle .
1	6B	yeah , they do n't really cost much . i mean , they do n't have to .
1	6B	or - or -
1	3I	i feel like this is the most logical place for it .
1	6B	soup kitchens trunc the public might pick up . it 's possible that the churches will pick up .
1	6B	veterinary hospital ? probably .
0	6B	we -
0	3I	kay , pre-cut wood , i 'm -
0	6B	let 's see here .
0	3I	let 's see here .
1	6B	i do n't know . i guess everything comes with um -
2	6B	well . i 'm sorry but i would go to invasive species next . because i mean plants are important but people are more important i mean i - uh - so -
0	3I	yeah . loose leaf paper .
2	6B	well , trunc a few years ago someone did uh , some reporting on this and said that they do n't really know how much money they spend on sports .
1	3I	if it works for the nakatas then -
2	6B	that 's weird .
1	3I	mm-kay , we 'll try that .
2	6B	and prenatal check-ups , i think are all very very important .
1	3I	would you suggest before or after ?
1	6B	it 'd trunc we 're just cutting .
2	6B	per , uh - per instance for the amount that trunc cost the county to take care - to deal with it .
1	3I	i do n't know how many liquids we 'll have . probably - yeah . should we just go up ?
1	6B	you just wonder - i mean how hard is it to get a taxi stop ? you just go out there and paint a -
2	3I	yeah , or the jugs and buckets . i mean , they 're all kinda close together , though . so probably does n't really matter .
1	3I	and shoe laces .
0	6B	oh , here is comes . okay .
0	6B	like where resources ? oh . oh , okay .
1	3I	cases of whiskey can go here .
1	3I	how bout next to the siding ?
1	3I	like that sounds like they kind of go together .
2	6B	uh - all of them kind of are important . but i suppose -
1	6B	yeah , i think it is .
1	3I	maybe the knives next - the box knives below the mousetraps , and the books of matches below the -
2	6B	but all the rest of em , um - yeah .
0	3I	if you 'd like to come in and rescue us again .
1	3I	right . so let 's essentially put it up here . i wo n't put it right next - it is a boating supply . we 'll put it - part of it . okay . your turn .
1	6B	that 's a good point .
1	6B	so , we can question mark on that one .
1	3I	and then if there 's , like , hats and backpacks we can put them after the toys .
1	6B	like - hunting or fishing . i dunno .
1	3I	four aisles . kay ?
2	3I	categories that we have .
1	6B	maybe kitten and puppy adoption ? reusable bag campaign ?
1	3I	okay , so yes , let 's do a random draw .
1	3I	yeah , and that 's water -
1	3I	all the accessory type things , if we have to for trunc room purposes .
1	3I	i 'm - i 'm thinking maybe above .
1	3I	this section ?
2	6B	i think assistant cooks ought to be cut .
2	3I	so , hats , maybe up here ?
1	6B	now the -
1	3I	and thick sweaters , probably by the heavy coats and vests .
1	3I	trunc wait , wait . this is fresh -
1	3I	that 's food .
1	6B	know what they would be - i guess i 'm kinda confused on that one .
0	6B	parked in the wrong place .
2	6B	either neighborhood watch support or chicken pox .
0	3I	or are they gigantic scissors ?
1	3I	definitely over there .
1	6B	that trunc you would do if you had a big budget .
1	6B	oh , okay . so we can keep vets . um .
1	6B	lotsa stray cats , okay . okay . community news ads .
2	3I	those are similar . they 're - i think they 're probably really heavy duty scissors .
1	6B	okay . so , let 's go from -
1	6B	something like that that 's kind of extraneous , and you could hopefully get somebody to donate or whatever .
1	6B	yes . that 's important . and music teachers are important .
2	6B	it sorta leads to to blight down the road though .
0	6B	public health and safety . well -
0	6B	stray cat spaying , kitten and puppy adoption -
1	3I	yeah or maybe this is just kind of a wrap around , like , there was n't enough room on that side and - i do n't know . okay , yeah . go ahead and put -
2	6B	because we live in this world and we are rich enough to talk about how we do n't like plastic bags we can - not - we can do this so - i um -
1	3I	yeah , that sounds fine . how bout the books - travel guides and books are the same thing .
2	3I	it 's trunc it 's the outlier , though
2	6B	i think we 're good on cutting two .
2	3I	i - uh , well i 'd say tools , yeah .
2	6B	over taxi stops ?
1	3I	maybe they 're kids backpacks .
2	3I	we ca n't do that , right ?
2	3I	yeah , that 's true , so chocolate bars , pouches of oatmeal -
1	3I	and canvas bag . think ?
0	3I	kay , whatcha got ?
2	3I	we agree that it 's in this one , right ? the middle one ?
1	3I	paper bags , why not ? bars of soap .
1	6B	equally .
0	6B	okay , think we 're done .
2	6B	absolutely has to stay . yes .
0	6B	apparently i 'm just hungry .
1	6B	alright . that 's good .
1	6B	you know , abandoned vehicles .
3	6B	they - trunc that was one trunc yeah , that was one of the - that was one of the basic issues in the campaign . you know ? uh , i mean , against it was -
1	6B	yeah , trunc i - i - i - let those go too .
2	6B	yeah , it trunc should say drama .
1	3I	uh , well it depends on what kinda books .
1	6B	mm-hm put the money to housing assistance .
1	3I	next to juice .
1	3I	mm-hm . that 'd be good .
1	3I	oh , yeah , that 's true . you always see flags near trunc travel books .
1	3I	by the bars of soap ?
1	6B	so , i - looking at it i say what -
2	6B	i think is critical .
2	6B	yeah , i think so . i can agree with that .
1	3I	how bout - ?
1	3I	easy enough .
1	6B	and the food bank .
2	3I	if nothing else .
2	6B	yeah . make em pay for it on their own .
1	6B	well i think maybe kitty - kitten and puppy adoption .
1	3I	yes . alright here we go .
1	3I	bundles of sticks , must be for kindling or something .
0	6B	that would be like a license i would think .
2	6B	we probably did n't cut that much out of the budget , but you know what ? that 's -that was the minimum that they were asking .
1	3I	mm-hm . mm-hm oh yeah , there we go . that 's good . yeah .
0	6B	note takers for disability services .
0	6B	note takers for disability services .
0	3I	hm . gas-powered cookstoves .
0	3I	hm . gas-powered cookstoves .
2	6B	well - for the public areas , maybe when we have more money in the budget .
1	6B	there 's enough . yeah .
1	6B	i would only take two out of that list .
1	6B	oh . very good . yeah .
2	3I	i 'm gon na put it -
2	6B	that seems controversial , i feel like they 'd want that .
2	6B	right , because again maybe you could get some volunteers or -
2	6B	oh , here we go . yes .
2	6B	i 'd rather ha-
0	3I	liter -
1	6B	okay . that 's fine .
1	3I	oh , that could go anywhere .
0	3I	stay on the right side . yeah , thanks .
0	6B	people call -
2	6B	well , trunc yeah , you need to advertise , uh -
2	3I	well , would n't you wan na put them near - the beverages ?
1	3I	mm-hm mm-kay .
0	3I	but anyway -
1	3I	i guess can go up there .
1	6B	so let 's - let 's - just go through this . and see if there 's anything that just needs to be eliminated .
1	3I	we can begin to establish a clothing section .
2	6B	people are doing well and for the most part their keeping their plastic bags anyway . and -
2	3I	well , knowing what might be in there -
2	3I	box knives would go in the trunc boating supplies , siding , buckets , power cords -
0	6B	yeah , w-
2	6B	yeah , but i think that 's a state - i think boating licenses are state , not county . i 'm a-
2	6B	maybe taxi stops since we do n't really have any of them here . and people can just call the taxi and meet them wherever . the corner .
1	6B	i know we 're getting distracted , but -
1	3I	use them to build fires .
1	6B	i know - they do n't even care what we did . all they care about is our tone of voice .
1	6B	take it off ? put it back next year ? it 's sorta like down the road kind of thing in a way .
1	6B	but we could cut poetry books .
2	6B	repair your own freaking flag .
3	6B	of course they did !
1	6B	i think that 's a good thing .
2	6B	why is that not in education and programs ?
2	6B	but you needed a teacher who uh , you know uh , could do kindergarten through -
1	3I	yeah , that 's good . trunc start - start one .
0	6B	outsourcing that .
1	6B	uh . i dunno if we can like cross things between categories .
1	6B	keep them .
1	6B	keep them .
1	6B	um . massage certificate . that 's another certification .
1	3I	yeah . with liquids .
3	6B	trunc things for trunc the quiet kids ? where are the drama , and the music , and the art , and the poetry , and all this stuff , when football has the big bucks ?
1	3I	they can -
0	3I	cuz i 've got bagels , too .
0	6B	egg farm .
0	6B	egg farm .
3	6B	first off , how many new poetry books do they buy every year ? trunc give me a break , i 'm a librarian . they buy , maybe , ten .
2	3I	definitely not with pet food .
2	6B	versus , like , a invasive species . i would maybe , like , trunc
1	3I	cuz you need a boat to fish , most of the time .
1	3I	yeah , that would be good .
2	6B	i think it 's a frill .
0	6B	oh . well , i do n't know . but they did when my kids were there and , um -
1	3I	um , uh , maybe - yeah , by the toilet paper .
1	3I	small saws . that 's with the power cord .
1	6B	would you fund that , or - ?
0	6B	mosquitos and things ? that 's mosquitos and things , right ? pest control .
0	3I	and large vests and -
1	3I	probably better with the mouse traps .
1	6B	that 's true . alright , news ads it is . um , and what about licensing ?
2	3I	this seems like sporting goods , the five pound weights .
1	3I	well let 's just - okay , so we 've got -
1	3I	somewhere between here and here .
1	3I	oh yeah , for the bulkier things .
0	6B	or in . and pay for a taxi .
1	6B	and the sugar-free juice machines , we keep that for - for their health purposes , and get rid of the acting coaches ?
2	3I	yeah , well you could shop here .
2	6B	i think , for me it 's very easily to say the sugar-free juice machines .
2	3I	that 's very specific . yeah , perfect ! we - it 's a good thing we left that open . i 'm gon na put this next to small axes . maybe . eh ?
1	3I	toasted kinds . yeah . so we do n't know . but that 's fine . it 's sort of the raw foods section . small saws . now these are gon na go with siding .
0	6B	junior soccer league , kitten puppy adoptions , soup kitchens -
0	3I	uh , bagels .
2	3I	yeah , they 're probably dried , would be my guess .
1	6B	well , weed control trunc we can take out .
3	6B	how many flag poles -
1	3I	it would make most sense in the aisle here with travel guides and toys .
1	3I	cake mix .
1	3I	cake mix ?
1	3I	cake mix .
1	3I	cake mix ?
1	3I	cake mix .
1	3I	the bars of soap .
2	6B	toxic waste disposal , ca n't get rid of that .
2	6B	well then maybe they would n't hafta have a football team anymore .
0	6B	reusable bag campaign , veterinary hospital , football stadium upkeep , and pest control . do you see anything that - ?
1	6B	does n't really say - teaching trunc seems like some of these licenses and things should all just be in the same -
2	6B	that could be cut , too , theoretically , if -
0	3I	that was it . yeah .
2	3I	we 'll put the shoes down there .
2	6B	see i think you have to have chicken pox vaccinations and job training programs .
1	6B	trunc trunc and i - i do n't know , you probably get something from your city council member .
1	6B	that 's probably a pretty cheap one . football equipment 's not cheap , but junior soccer league should be .
2	6B	oh , that 's for making a subway system though . is n't it ?
1	6B	federal money and -
1	3I	we should put our travel guides with our books .
1	3I	they go together . eggs and beets definitely go together .
2	6B	terrible threat . i mean i and this - and this even before the newest evidence has come out about -
1	3I	yeah , it should . i think outdoorsy stuff . it 's like - yeah , like right here .
2	3I	these are gon na gon na get - hopefully get easier as we get more on the board .
2	6B	sure , well we 'll see what we wan na cut from here .
2	6B	you have to pay the towing service .
1	3I	so we have trunc extra space .
1	6B	yeah that is true .
1	3I	so it went in a u_ shape , essentially , from the travel guides to the toys ?
1	6B	but that could go under -
2	6B	we can start with two from each .
1	3I	they 'll just have to live with our trunc
1	3I	yeah . that 's fine .
1	3I	yeah . that 's fine .
3	6B	that 's it ! yeah , it 's a - it 's the drug laws of the united states , and it - so - and they ca n't take the money from it . so -
1	3I	it could go there . okay .
2	3I	ooh . very nice . not - not - not just - not just normal whisky
1	3I	and then the box knives . box knives -
1	3I	i 'd say somewhere here .
1	3I	how bout right next to the toilet paper ?
2	3I	with the sticks , do you think ?
1	6B	i think we should -
1	3I	we could put that in - in - maybe by the paper bags or something ?
1	3I	um - would you wan na -
1	3I	like , cuz you have to do - you have to make it , right ?
0	3I	and where did i put -
0	3I	we do n't have deck chairs .
1	6B	they are . they 're good enough .
2	3I	just , kinda - oh , travel guides ! travel guides , books -
0	3I	pre-cut wood . matches .
1	3I	here . you know .
1	3I	which we do n't really have an office supply section but - yeah , they can go with the travel guides .
2	3I	i would think so , too .
1	3I	or up here ? next to wetsuits and boating supplies ?
1	6B	hm . how many d'you wan na cut from each - ? or we could like , start with one and see how we -
1	6B	uh , cooking classes - home ec , i actually -
2	6B	okay . i do n't think reproductive education should be cut .
1	3I	well , these are small .
2	3I	um that - that seems like - yeah , just put that next to the boating supplies . i doubt we 'll have anything else that will be there . here , i wan na trunc i wan na do one .
1	6B	uh . if you had to get rid of something maybe reusable bag campaign .
1	3I	sure . yeah , that looks great .
0	6B	are you alright ?
1	3I	toys - make this a sort of a sundries aisle .
1	3I	trunc more junk food .
2	3I	let 's do the -
1	6B	so i mean , it -
2	6B	trunc uh - uh - the trunc the immediate lack of - a lack of that wo n't affect the public health .
2	6B	well , that 's food inspection . just food - just , in general .
1	3I	for , um -
2	6B	reusable bag campaign ? i would cut that .
0	6B	you know , where do they - ?
1	3I	with the travel guides .
1	3I	with the travel guides .
2	6B	i - i think it will be - it will be easier for the city to recover from the loss of a few flagpoles than -
0	3I	well , let 's see . okay -
0	6B	what is a public access trunc um -
2	3I	well this is near the power cord , though .
1	3I	outliers or something .
1	3I	or - near siding ? i do n't know .
0	6B	so who 's gon na supply the equipment ?
2	3I	you know , we also have this area . which maybe could correspond to -
0	6B	end scene .
1	6B	i do n't - i do n't know .
2	3I	so it works .
2	6B	well good !
1	3I	do you have any - ?
1	6B	then we can get rid of weed control . so we need one more , if we 're gon na do four .
2	6B	how you gon na screw that up ?
0	3I	bags of -
0	6B	okay . yeah poetry books ?
1	3I	fish hooks ? trunc
0	6B	so , that 's - yeah . we 'll trunc yeah .
2	3I	we could have a sweet section here with chocolate bars , boxes of doughnuts , cake .
2	6B	i think if you 're on - if you 're on a county road and you have a -
2	3I	but the eggs , you assume , is fresh . sticks of butter you assume is fresh . you need a refrigerator .
2	6B	yeah that 's not part of -
2	6B	yes . it mostly already is anyways .
1	6B	what do you think ? i 'm thinking maybe either -
1	6B	see , i think it 's gon na get harder when we get into some of these things .
0	6B	invasive .
1	6B	yeah . yeah . taxi stops .
2	6B	that 's a more important -
1	3I	i would put that - where was the , uh - ? yes , that 's fine .
1	3I	? i mean , i 'd - you probably have a better idea than i do .
1	3I	unfortunately , i do n't know where books might go . where would books go ? toys , maybe ?
0	3I	we go .
0	3I	few spaces in between .
2	3I	hey , there we go . should we move this electric heater ?
1	6B	boy 's basketball club . i feel like that 's kinda like the junior soccer league .
1	3I	bingo ?
1	3I	bingo ?
1	3I	bingo ?
1	3I	large cups . okay , that would be , like -
2	3I	so , i think instead , i might put it in the - um - kinda the utility -
2	6B	yes . bagels gone .
0	3I	that kind of - we do n't have a personal -
1	3I	oh , how bout right there ?
0	6B	station where you publicly access - something . i dunno .
1	3I	it might be -
2	3I	right , but they 're - oh , okay .
1	3I	very good . very good .
1	3I	so is that mean - ? is that more with the boating then ?
0	3I	figs .
0	6B	soup kitchen
1	3I	that 's housewares , kind of . yeah . yeah .
0	3I	um , chocolate bars .
0	3I	um , chocolate bars .
1	3I	school stuff , actually , i think .
1	6B	hunting tags , yeah .
0	6B	removal ? um -
1	3I	i would say could put clothing in this area sort of near the -
0	3I	and bagels
0	6B	did we ?
2	6B	mm-hm . and then we can choose trunc as far as i 'm concerned , either football stadium -
2	3I	shoot . there 's , like , awkward spacing here .
0	6B	public access , and community and news ads ?
1	6B	uh i do n't know .
1	3I	well , we 've got - we 've got face cream .
1	6B	i think ! i mean - mm-hm .
0	6B	six .
0	6B	six .
1	3I	section in here .
1	3I	five-pound weights . that 's - that go with the siding and the -
2	6B	bone to pick with -
2	3I	okay trunc or could be at the end it could be the end of the aisle down trunc yeah yeah yeah .
1	3I	they go to - the same .
1	3I	uh , next to the soybeans .
2	3I	so sugar would be baking items -
2	3I	large vests , up with the shoelaces , clothes .
1	3I	there it is .
2	6B	it 's a little more important . yeah . prenatal checkups could fall trunc fall under reproductive education cuz like you - er .
2	6B	alright . dog catcher 's definitely outta there .
2	6B	i - i think it 's important .
2	6B	two cooks , we 'd probably need more . but , um - sex ed . i feel like sex ed 's important . i think it 's really important for people . i do n't know , my school district did n't do a lot of sex ed education , and it 's , like , that 's kind of important , and it 's kind of just biology , so you trunc should -
1	3I	oops ! that would be adjacent to boating .
2	6B	oh , i would get rid of both .
1	3I	yeah , you can cut them with scissors , cuz they 're trunc they 're little sticks . they 're not - trunc if it was bundles of wood , maybe use -
2	3I	i think we 've got a big section here where we can put clothing .
2	3I	yeah , there we go .
2	6B	so that 's an easy one . you say towing system - services ?
2	3I	right over those thick sweaters . so you can label that so - then - i 'm putting those right underneath the thick sweaters .
0	3I	and let 's see , tow ropes -
0	6B	that 's , like not in addition - that 's , like , in addition to what 's in the schools , right ?
1	6B	that 's kinda what i was thinking .
2	3I	yeah , the sides look like they are also aisles .
1	6B	i think it would be actually really harder , cuz we did n't have to cut -
0	3I	heavy cable , um -
2	3I	and this is the kitchen .
2	6B	no pest control , you probably want to keep that . so we 've - we 've cut nine from here , and nine from here , but only six from here .
1	6B	true . yeah . yeah .
1	3I	which let 's go ahead and we 'll put that underneath the rolls of duct tape .
0	6B	what 's a difference between a public access station and a public news station ?
2	3I	maybe on the side , where ice cream is .
1	3I	what do you think , here ?
1	6B	yeah , i guess i 've seen them , like -
1	6B	i think they are too .
1	6B	then next one that could be cut -
0	3I	thick s-
1	3I	and these are two things .
1	6B	let 's pick one list -
2	6B	um . we - we can - keep either weed control or invasive species removal . they 're pretty much - they 're -
2	6B	it 's a lot of animal services . could we roll some of those into each other and -
1	3I	how bout tubing ?
0	6B	taxi trunc
1	6B	see if that goes . then if we ca n't handle that we 'll just - yeah . yeah .
0	6B	coaches .
2	6B	uh , fishing licensing . same as before . okay , public bus upkeep .
0	6B	needle exchange , uh - bagel factory inspections . ew -
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets ?
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	buckets .
1	3I	pet food and large cups ?
1	3I	by the tweezers ? face cream adjacent to tweezers .
2	6B	no . no . dear god no . no . that a - yeah . that is - needed everybody .
0	3I	travel guides , kinda there .
0	6B	training -
2	6B	screw that .
0	6B	well like trunc if you trunc like what , if you have no hands ?
2	3I	we - trunc you know what we need is - you know what they call end caps ? that 's what 's at the end of each aisle . i know . and it 's what they want you to buy on impulse . we need to put that - chocolate - that 's right . let 's do it .
2	6B	boy .
2	6B	well - you just said that those like just be
1	3I	that makes sense . they can be a baking supply .
1	6B	alright . sure .
1	3I	want do with this stuff ?
1	6B	i think that 's helpful .
2	6B	uh - trunc i would n't want my public government to be paying for that .
2	6B	well , they ca n't ! there 's a federal law against banks dealing with drug dealers .
1	6B	we 're ready - we 're ready to go on to city council , or the county whatever .
1	3I	yeah , and then there 's toilet paper , and paper goods i guess , and that 's all food .
2	3I	i 'm gon na put my shoelaces -
1	3I	okay , what are you thinking ? cuz we have our liters of water you wan na put it there ?
2	3I	yeah . raw materials does n't matter because we see eggs and sugar , like , in a - in different places . i 'm happy with that .
1	6B	we 're doing it . right .
0	3I	fleece-lined boots . did we have any other -
1	3I	probably with the wood if you 're gon na cut wood .
0	6B	do any of these jump out as -
2	6B	this one 's harder to cut things from .
1	3I	oh , like here .
1	6B	i 'm wondering if we should -
1	3I	oh - we had something - yes .
1	3I	well , look -
0	6B	this one we did n't go through in detail , infrastructure and licensing . we decided to keep the teaching certificates .
0	6B	oh yeah . what - ? oh the public -
1	3I	either one .
1	3I	i 'd put it there .
1	3I	well , it can be -
1	3I	small saws , well that can go by the power cords , don'tcha think ?
3	6B	the massage certificates are gon na go trunc i 'd get rid of the tattoos , the massages -
2	3I	so these - i would say these should come after mousetraps cuz they 're small like mousetraps .
0	6B	veteran 's hospital , football stadium upkeep , and pest control .
1	3I	sure let 's put the liters - was that ? the liters of water -
0	6B	like it 's -
2	6B	seems rather ridiculous .
2	6B	is n't that crazy ? i just learned that today .
0	3I	did we do toiletries ? yes .
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts . oh , was it -
2	6B	okay , that 's five .
1	3I	very logical .
2	3I	yeah . uh , yeah , or soy beans . sort of , um , bulk foods .
2	6B	yeah , yeah . definitely .
1	3I	should we just stick that with these items that we 're gon na put in the boat ?
0	3I	whiskey . cases .
2	3I	oh , yeah , cuz it 's a vegetable . yeah , yeah .
1	6B	do n't they have a department ? i do n't know .
2	3I	trunc yeah , trunc somewhere - i was thinking somewhere around here , cuz then it 's , like , you could wrap around from the sugar if you 're feeling sugary . but yeah , ice cream .
1	3I	offer some space .
2	3I	we are finished . wow . this room though .
1	6B	importantly about that one .
2	6B	pothole maintenance we need to have .
2	6B	poetry books . well -
1	3I	you can go ahead and rearrange that all if you choose .
0	6B	bagel factory
2	6B	and you cut it -
2	6B	seemed like a no brainer .
0	3I	then bottles of juice .
2	3I	yeah . yeah , do it . next to wetsuits .
1	3I	around this pre-cut wood ?
1	3I	okay . i can -
2	6B	everyone speeds anyway and do n't we already have them up there ? are they trunc do we have to pay rent for having them ?
1	6B	bagel factory inspections , or the invasive species removal could be let go for trunc invasive species removal could be let go for awhile .
2	6B	certified , so -
1	6B	especially , i feel like in a - , depends on the size of our , like -
1	6B	living in seattle . there 's not a whole lotta moose hunting going on - here .
0	6B	or whenever i watched it .
0	3I	okay , the box cutter . box cutting knives . um .
2	3I	and this is sugar , and cake mix , so -
0	6B	okay , so i think we 've got eight off of here so let 's - let 's review that again , so we 're trunc we want teaching certificates . we want speed limit .
1	6B	it 's a frill . that 's right . if you wan na repair your flagpole
0	6B	taxi stops . what 's that mean ? do you think ?
1	3I	near travel guides ?
2	3I	these ones are a little sad .
1	3I	we 're running outta room on this aisle yeah . that looks fine .
0	6B	alright . um .
1	3I	uh would that
2	6B	okay , so we 'll uh say forget about the bus stops , forget about the tattoo boating we might save , pothole maintenance that 's probably important want to wreck our cars .
1	3I	it 's kinda random .
1	3I	the processed stuff . um . so .
0	6B	yeah , i think my mom -
0	6B	education and programs . math tutors , assistant cooks , sex ed , custodians . speech therapy , football equipment , acting coaches , poetry books , special ed teachers , cooking classes , note takers . sugar free juice machines , bookkeeping classes , and music teachers .
2	6B	i , um - but i - but i think it is a public health -
1	6B	trunc trunc do n't they ?
2	6B	is not gender specific , so it - leave that .
1	3I	the dried figs , the chocolate bars and pouches of oatmeal ? that works for me .
1	3I	mm , small axes . probably going with the power cords and duct tape , i would imagine .
0	6B	okay . so - okay .
2	3I	just because it does n't really belong in either ends of what we 're going with . but it does - it should go in - it should go in the garage .
1	6B	but i wonder if that 's the kinda thing where they could get parents who 're - to do like , an art docent type thing , but probably not with music , cuz you -
1	6B	okay , well -
2	6B	are they are - they are different . but . okay .
0	3I	there 's a lot of empty space over here . okay . we 're done , i think .
1	3I	but did we have a camping area yet ?
2	3I	socks are kinda random . put them by the pet food , we do n't have anything down there .
1	3I	well , since we have both sides -
1	3I	i would p-
1	6B	boating license .
2	6B	i could get rid of the sugar free juice machines , if it 's truly sugar free .
0	3I	and we 'll -
1	6B	yeah , might fall into another -
1	3I	they - they go with that .
1	3I	junk .
1	3I	and that kind of migrates around here .
1	3I	let 's see how that goes .
0	6B	prenatal check-ups . neighborhood watch support .
0	6B	pre-natal check-ups , neighborhood watch support -
0	3I	oh i did . yeah . cuz i was like it does n't fit with -
1	3I	, by the trunc in , like , the limited number of aisles , but -
1	3I	yeah , it 's got ta be over - one of these i think , do n't you think ?
2	3I	i think we ended up using up - but maybe go on the other side of the toys ?
2	6B	education . why is it all in different categories ?
0	6B	fishing licenses , public bus upkeep , and drainage ditches . well -
1	3I	by the -
1	3I	all the stuff 's just kinda all - it 's just the - yeah - oh . a tow rope though . that 's - that 's boating .
2	6B	is it ?
2	6B	what trunc were we gon na get rid of the juice machines , or - ?
1	3I	maybe where the water was ?
1	3I	uh yeah
2	3I	um . and i have some small axes which would probably go very good with the box knives as well .
1	6B	okay . sugar free , okay .
1	6B	no . i think people are good enough on their own .
2	6B	so maybe then we just decide that we have enough right now .
1	6B	i dunno . um .
2	3I	well , what we could do then is maybe make this room ?
1	3I	life saving vest , or it might be a -
1	3I	just in case there 's - i forget if we have shirts or not . yeah .
2	6B	so , let me see , s_t_d_ trunc let 's get rid of the education one . the s_t_d_ education we 'll get rid of .
1	6B	yeah , veteran 's medical assistance . i think so . weed control ?
0	3I	some .
1	6B	um , i think if you 're gon na have a kitchen -
1	3I	that seems that these kinds of things would go with them , right ?
1	3I	dried figs ! so that 's more food .
1	6B	um , job training ?
1	3I	see i immediately go to , okay what does it take to m-
1	3I	trying to see - maybe travel guides ? so maybe here ?
1	6B	so do you think we - we could present to a committee and would seem -
2	6B	we could 've cut the toxic waste disposal , you with no idea !
1	3I	well , i guess coats - we have hats , where are hats ?
1	3I	right , right . um , and then - yeah , baked goods but nothing refrigerated here .
1	3I	that 's easy .
1	6B	should we figure - ? okay .
1	3I	they always put them somewhere different .
0	3I	i heard that -
2	3I	hooray .
1	3I	egg timers above refrigerator magnets ?
1	3I	on the far righthand aisle .
1	3I	fleece lined boots . maybe by the shoelaces ?
1	6B	we coulda -
1	6B	i vote cutting additional bus stops .
1	3I	i have no idea though . i dunno what else is in here .
2	6B	no , does n't .
2	3I	yeah , it 's kinda creepy , actually .
1	3I	and have sticks and then wood .
1	3I	sounds good . near the middle of the store .
1	3I	i would put it here .
0	3I	and bundles of sticks .
1	6B	eh , no .
1	6B	cause you can find poetry books .
2	3I	i - somewhere up here , for sure .
2	3I	i 'm sorry . she told us not to move it , but -
1	6B	chicken pox vaccinations sounds important .
1	3I	be the easiest thing , right ? these would seem to go with ice cream , right ? with all the sweets together .
1	6B	or public access . yeah . i would cut that before i would cut the dog catcher , too .
2	6B	if i have to choose between stray cat spaying and community news i trunc i 'd pick trunc spaying the cats although how they 'll know about it when we ca n't tell them anything , i do n't know .
0	6B	is there some particular reason why bagel factories in particular are being singled out for being cut ? it 's jus-
1	6B	aw , that 's terrible .
1	6B	should also stay .
2	6B	should certainly stay -
1	3I	we moved it . yeah .
2	6B	s_t_d_ education should probably not be cut .
1	6B	one of my bosses said something to me that - that stayed with me for a long time . he said -
1	3I	how bout you trunc so you can repair your cushions with rolls of duct tape .
1	6B	dog catcher , yeah .
1	3I	buckets ? uh , yeah .
1	6B	okay , so what else could we add back ? we added back the hunting tags .
1	3I	next - next to trunc
3	6B	i personally believe that sort of health ed , sex ed matters .
1	3I	sounds great .
1	3I	where do you think water should go ?
0	3I	that leaves us with this one .
1	3I	i guess camping .
1	3I	the sweaters .
1	6B	right . right . uh-huh .
1	3I	somewhere on that - yeah . somewhere in this aisle , but maybe not -
1	6B	i 'm sure there is .
0	3I	and then i got cushions for -
0	6B	veterinary hospital .
0	6B	veterinary hospital .
0	6B	veterinary hospital .
0	6B	veterinary hospital .
2	6B	i think chicken pox .
1	6B	we already - we 're gon na take out -
0	3I	so , bottles of juice -
1	6B	we would n't have to - we could n't have to do that .
2	6B	i think custodians are pretty trunc like actually keeping custodians around , feel like we should do .
2	6B	um . oh , i think i see something better .
2	3I	the - trunc the baked stuff on this side of the cake mix , below it .
0	6B	okay , so what do we got ? we got two -
1	3I	coleman stoves ?
0	3I	so-
1	3I	well that 's - that 's - yeah . packages of cookies .
2	6B	yeah , or else it 's , uh - or else like what trunc then cats would be just , you know , reproducing everywhere , and you have a bunch of cats -
1	6B	we have to support the veterans .
2	6B	or there 'd be cats everywhere .
1	3I	how 's that ?
1	6B	well , it 's king county hospital .
2	3I	i say that goes by refrigerator magnets , too . that 's the random stuff .
1	3I	um - would you maybe put it by -
2	6B	we wan na not eliminate any more than we have to .
2	3I	fishnet , there we go . sure .
0	6B	yeah . it 's - it 's - like being built right now underneath capitol hill and the u_ district .
1	3I	kay here . here .
1	3I	more - more vestments than accessories , alright .
1	3I	i have no clue .
0	6B	and pest control .
0	6B	and pest control .
1	3I	yeah . totally .
3	6B	that is so crazy !
0	6B	public bus upkeep .
0	6B	public bus upkeep .
0	6B	public bus upkeep -
2	6B	no , i 'd rather get rid of the juice machine and keep the acting coaches .
1	3I	yeah , with the wood .
1	6B	sex ed , i think -
1	6B	can - assuming that it 's new equipment , each year .
1	3I	the - yeah .
1	6B	yeah . i think we got our five .
1	3I	bags of peat moss , gardening supplies , um -
0	6B	like , trunc there are some places on the road that are designated taxi stops instead of parking spaces , like usually they 're in front of like clubs or - and stuff like that , or at the airport .
1	6B	yeah , we could . it -
1	3I	i really think it 's sort of funny place , but i mean - oh ! we could have it up here by travel guides .
0	6B	hm . hm-hm .
1	3I	well let 's see if we can split this group up into something smaller then .
0	3I	oh , this -
1	6B	unless there was anything else .
2	6B	well , i could probably vote for football stadium upkeep , if we 're gon na vote for football equipment . on the other hand , we may be making enemies by totally attacking the football folks . if we gave them their stadium upkeep ,
1	3I	um , like lunch bags ? like -
2	6B	trunc see , trunc classes , acting coaches . i would say that acting coaches - i mean , i know the school of drama would disagree with us , but i really do n't see how public funds should be spent on acting coaches .
1	3I	light jacket . okay .
0	6B	okay . i think i 'm good .
1	3I	sort of three sections .
1	6B	yeah , and they - and they probably , at least indirectly , pay through trunc pay for it through their licensing fees .
2	3I	well - okay . let 's just kinda - cuz we know there 's food , we know there 's sort of outdoor equipment .
1	3I	empty plastic jugs . pfft i dunno .
1	6B	yeah , i would let that go and leave that to maybe a - yeah .
1	6B	cuz you just flag it down it comes over to the -
2	6B	for instance , i do n't think it would be a good idea to cut toxic waste disposal .
1	6B	i do n't think so either .
1	6B	yeah . i do n't think that 's so important . like boating licenses , that 's a source of income and -
1	3I	tweezers is gon na go - oh - okay .
2	3I	that could be like , down here somewhere or up here .
0	6B	oh , that 's eight programs .
1	3I	okay . mm .
1	3I	k-
2	6B	well , if we gave - if we stop spaying the cats , then yeah , we 're gon na need that .
1	3I	i 'm just trying to think of -
2	3I	usually do n't they have them closer to the front 's of stores , so they can see people stealing them ?
1	6B	and then , um -
1	3I	guess the power cords .
1	6B	do we have well , we 're - right now in - in this city we 're in the process of building one , but in this town do we have one ?
2	6B	pretty easily , you know , through books or looking things up in the library -
1	6B	dogs -
2	3I	well , , that 's , like , our camping , right ?
1	6B	it is important .
2	6B	yeah . that 's what i 'm wondering like could n't you just put it all in the same - ?
1	3I	yeah , and i was just thinking , where 's that whiskey gon na go ? um -
1	6B	the feds would always be in it and so forth .
0	3I	deck chairs .
0	3I	deck chairs .
2	6B	they trunc they wo n't touch it . it was a bank , uh , trunc in , uh , seattle -
0	6B	okay , so that 's two . what do we - ? what - ? okay .
0	6B	veteran 's and hospital .
2	6B	let 's get rid of the reproductive education and one of these two .
2	6B	stuff . and you might also need housing assistance like to - kinda help you pay for your house trunc or some kinda housing until you can pay for it yourself .
1	6B	sure . maybe , um -
1	6B	i know a lot of churches run food banks , too .
1	3I	not as close up there ?
3	3I	nah . oh well , depends . but we 're adults !
2	6B	not gon na happen . somebody will , but they can go out and paint the darn pole themselves . alright ?
1	6B	yeah , i would trunc i agree . i agree . i think those are nice , but it 's not something you really - i mean all these other things need it - need it more if we use that . yeah .
0	3I	and we got beets .
2	6B	yeah , but you have to pay em .
1	3I	next to siding ?
2	3I	no i 'm - i 'm a - i agree . dried figs should be ostracized .
1	3I	yeah , okay so , probably leave at least a space for trunc i do n't know , maybe on this side , then ? i 'm trunc not trunc i 'm not really sure .
1	3I	clothing is dry goods .
1	6B	cooking classes you ca n't get for free i 'm sure . but there 's -
1	6B	you 're right . it 's hard .
1	3I	maybe right there ? yeah .
2	3I	but unfortunately we have siding .
0	3I	trunc are there any tools up there ?
2	6B	i mean it 's nice but i - i think some , like math and some of those others are m-
2	6B	hunting and fishing .
1	3I	buckets go by empty plastic jugs .
1	3I	alright . now we get to decide on chocolate bars . and i think it 's gon na be opposite - at the top . right over here , next to ice cream .
1	6B	oh , maybe when there 's an accident or something ?
1	6B	and keeping - keeping kids occupied and off the streets , and keeping crime down .
2	6B	yeah , right . does n't that seem like it would be a private type of thing ?
1	6B	i - we had talked about cutting the classes , and i do n't know whether we wan na stick with that idea or not .
2	6B	no , massage certificates . nah . flagpole repair . no .
2	3I	since we - might as well , since we have all this space for food .
1	6B	we could lump that in together with the math tutors and - keep one or the other .
1	3I	this looks like more staples .
2	6B	maybe , um -
0	6B	i 'm a little confused about the subway system . is it already operable ?
1	3I	say , maybe more towards - down here ?
1	3I	oh . that 's a good one . yeah .
2	3I	hats . hats would go over here in the -
1	3I	out door ? or is that home improvement ? i do n't even know what a heavy cable is . do they mean , like , towing rope ?
1	3I	large cups . ooh , large cups ! this is a -
0	6B	and the , uh , sugar-free machines are gone .
1	3I	ca n't move them . yep .
0	6B	why they have boys basketball club and no girls ? i trunc
1	6B	i would also say that 's important for control .
1	3I	yeah , cuz if the - if the -
1	3I	large vests . that 's probably outdoor stuff .
2	3I	refrigerator magnets . but that 's -
0	6B	okay , so public health and safety . trunc
0	6B	boating licenses , pothole maintenance , subway system -
2	6B	get rid of the needle exchange .
0	3I	i think there were nuts ?
0	3I	alright , pouches of oatmeal .
0	6B	is it the one think you feel like -
0	3I	trunc i do n't think so .
1	3I	yeah , it does n't really fit any of these places , does it ?
2	6B	trunc can a taxi trunc taxis can stop wherever it wants , ca n't it ?
0	6B	cooking classes , note takers , disability services -
1	3I	that 's cooking stuff .
0	6B	mm , a separate office , you mean ?
0	6B	where are they ?
1	6B	some services or some people who would be willing to - ?
1	6B	fishing the same as hunting tags , that 's -
2	3I	mm-kay . so if we 're doing kind of a camping-ish thing then backpacks should go in here .
0	6B	i do n't know . i guess at first i kinda thought like when we were talking before i felt like needle exchange meant -
1	6B	people flag them anyway , so -
1	3I	the clothing .
0	6B	it 's in the schools .
1	6B	let 's - i - i 'm happy with cutting that .
1	6B	i think weed control might be less important than neighborhood watch .
1	3I	yeah , we 'll just - do a little placeholder there . yeah .
1	3I	they must be there though .
2	6B	i think speech therapy 's important , as well as sex ed .
1	6B	for the same reason , why are they paying for the , uh - acting coaches ?
0	3I	there we go . now it 's velcroed .
2	3I	list . because look .
1	3I	okay . sure .
1	3I	okay . sure .
2	6B	so , infrastructure and licensing . well , teaching certificates . yes , you have to have that .
1	3I	i would n't -
1	6B	yeah , maybe we should .
1	3I	canned - maybe here ?
1	3I	cushions for deck chairs no .
0	3I	actually , i 've heard it , but i do n't know what it - i trunc not - ever - uh , trunc i do n't know what it means .
1	3I	uh , bags of peat moss i suppose -
0	3I	oops .
0	3I	oops .
0	3I	oops .
0	3I	oops .
1	6B	where - are the p- ? yeah .
0	6B	okay , so -
0	6B	okay , so -
0	3I	okay . so -
0	6B	okay , so .
0	6B	okay . so -
0	3I	okay . so -
0	6B	okay . so -
0	6B	bus upkeep , drainage ditches .
1	3I	okay , trunc yeah , maybe we 'll have something else we wan na stick in there .
0	3I	and large vests ?
0	6B	um . and recreation and public services .
2	6B	s_t_d_ we definitely need that . toxic waste disposal , gosh we kinda need that . hospital additions . probably need that .
2	3I	more type of supply type things , so half inch tubing , duct tape -
1	3I	exactly . so what do you think with these ?
1	6B	i do n't like cutting things in general .
1	3I	dried .
1	3I	trunc tweezers , maybe with toilet paper ?
2	6B	yeah , i 'm not really sure why this city is -
2	6B	takes care of it .
1	3I	how about next to the travel guides and heavy coats ?
1	6B	the bus stops .
1	6B	the bus stops .
1	3I	i like that idea .
2	3I	small axes we have to put by the wood over here .
1	6B	i think music is important , for sure .
1	3I	true . dried figs , though . um , maybe near soybeans ?
1	3I	uh , yes . uh-huh .
1	6B	how much do you wan na cut ?
1	3I	yeah . that 's the refrigerated stuff .
0	3I	is that for traveling or more just for a quick breakfast before school ?
2	3I	cuz i do n't think it would go - trunc trunc to me , that 's more refrigerated - siding -
1	3I	yeah . yeah , kind of electrical stuff .
2	6B	we do n't have any here . i mean -
2	6B	chicken pox trunc chicken pox trunc vaccinations , also very important . needle exchange and the sex offender database -
1	3I	books could go near toys , i think . maybe .
1	3I	see that 's kind of - the scissors -
1	3I	we do n't have anything else like that yet .
1	6B	then , you should n't have weeds . i mean but like if it 's just like weeds like dandelions in a field - like - you can leave those , you know ?
2	6B	well no , it 's operated by - excuse me i keep going back and - it 's operated by university of washington , which is - which is a -
2	6B	is it trunc well , would n't it require , though - ?
1	3I	bottles of juice . good idea .
1	3I	okay , outdoor things for home .
1	6B	i do n't know . i guess i was just sort of assuming it was like , sort of licenses .
1	3I	i trunc i agree .
2	3I	i mean , normally they have their own aisle , but -
1	3I	that 's a good one , yeah .
1	3I	just incase you fall in .
1	3I	maybe in - in this one ?
1	3I	this would be kind of a camping type thing , electric heaters ?
0	3I	oh f-
0	6B	oh f-
2	6B	public access is still another category . all the cable companies obligated to make a channel available .
1	3I	that first aisle again .
1	3I	now we can be as obnoxious as those lists were . or not .
1	6B	okay . that 's three .
1	3I	that would probably make the trunc make sense .
0	3I	is it a boating hat ?
2	3I	these are groceries . there 's definitely groceries .
0	3I	grab and go , toiletries -
0	6B	did we talk about the reusable bag campaign ?
2	6B	that 's also borderline . see what happens with the rest of it .
1	3I	toothpaste with the -
1	6B	yes , and when i read that i thought of a point person within the police department that -
0	6B	boys trunc
1	3I	yeah . okay , fleece-lined boots .
2	3I	with the tools ? or with the stationary stuff ?
2	6B	it 's - pretty necessary - for those people .
0	6B	mm-kay . um
1	6B	alright , let 's go list by list . what about education programs ? what do you think we ca n't afford to cut , and what do you think we can maybe skip for a few years ?
2	6B	trunc well , quite honestly you probably could cut that one cuz you could just buy quicken .
1	3I	yeah . right . that 's right .
1	6B	um , and sugar-free machines . that 's four .
1	6B	regulation of that ? yeah , definitely .
1	6B	we decided s_t_d_ education could be grouped in with reproductive education , right ?
1	3I	yes , perfect . perfect .
1	3I	maybe somewhere -
1	6B	i say we do n't need additional bus stops at the - at this time .
1	3I	mm mm-hm .
0	6B	okay , you have to go through an exam to get it .
0	6B	and weed control . that 's four .
2	3I	yeah , and we have a lot of empty space .
1	3I	well not to be confused - yeah , guess it would . yeah she say we could move it ? yeah , she said we could move it .
1	6B	well , i - you know , i do n't like bagels so it 'd be fine with me if we did n't do bagel factory inspections .
1	6B	yeah . otherwise you 're - yeah .
0	6B	alright , so looking at this list -
2	3I	let 's hold off .
0	3I	yeah . does that look like ?
2	6B	you 'll have to keep the junior soccer league .
1	3I	fleece lined boots . well we can put those next to the thick sweaters
2	6B	and i spent thousands of dollars on it . so , alright , we - but we got ta come up with two things out of this list and there 's nothing on this list that is n't a good thing .
1	3I	second aisle -
2	3I	which i 'm gon na go ahead and put with the pouches of oatmeal . as sorta that prepackaged deal .
3	6B	i just think football does n't belong in our schools .
1	3I	could use buckets for that . yeah ? maybe there ?
2	6B	i wan na keep all trunc i wan na keep all three of those . if anything had to go , well -
1	6B	i kinda like that personally . but you know maybe that could be cut if like there 's something else - tattoo artist licenses .
1	3I	power things ?
2	6B	i would be inclined to get rid of the boys basketball club because you do n't see a girls basketball club .
2	6B	you know - i trunc i do n't - trunc the issue is n't getting my car towed . the issue is keeping the trunc keeping people from , like , abandoning their cars on public roadways .
2	6B	although you do n't wan na go to those sources . there they are .
1	6B	oh ! because -
1	3I	paper bags . someplace here .
1	6B	of any sort , or for that matter a food warm up program in the school - in schools or whatever you 're gon na continue to need assistant cooks .
1	6B	institution . it probably gets state money and -
0	6B	stray cat spaying we 've already public news junior soccer , kitten and puppy adoption -
1	6B	yeah , i do too . sugar free juice machines .
2	6B	okay , so that might be on the maybe list too , cuz that could go under - that will go under - okay , yeah , that 's - that 's one of ours .
2	6B	because it brings a lot of people in . it brings publicity to the area .
0	6B	trunc uh , egg farm regulations .
1	6B	or lump it under pest control . there we go .
2	6B	i do n't even know what trunc where to get that .
1	6B	so much , um - maybe reproductive education .
2	3I	could be . and this could all be , um - this is m-
1	3I	the same side .
2	6B	well , luckily we did n't have to take it out , so , we 're good !
2	3I	feel like our pet food 's kinda -
1	3I	um , clothing items that were , like on the top ?
0	6B	it 's best you come to the public health department and be tested .
0	3I	and saw .
1	6B	wait . okay . well , trunc yeah , okay . so poetry books - i guess poetry 's important .
1	6B	i do n't know if it 's high priority . if you 're looking at , like , cutting a food bank or cutting a dog catcher .
1	3I	so we 'll put the clothes here , sort of opposite some of the travel stuff ?
1	3I	heavy coats , with the large vests .
1	6B	okay . if you -
1	3I	over there . no , they 're not just vests , they are large .
1	3I	that 'd be fine .
2	3I	quite a number of clothes
2	6B	pest control we need , spaying we need . uh , food banks we need . kitten and puppy adoption i guess we do n't need but we 've got all those puppies and kittens because nobody 's spaying .
1	6B	too hard to learn .
1	3I	hats do the same .
2	6B	yeah , s_t_d_ education needs to stay .
2	6B	uh , maybe we should n't .
1	6B	so , education programs . why do n't we - ?
0	3I	okay , so that 's for school supplies .
1	6B	okay , how bout massage certificates ? flagpole repair ?
0	6B	okay . toxic waste disposal - let 's see , one , two , three , four , five , six - trunc go down to veterans . so , starting with toxic waste disposal -
1	6B	how bout pest control ? clearly . i mean , we ca n't have , like , county property that 's covered in -
2	6B	because we 're going to get sex ed -
0	6B	over ten percent of the trunc of the programs . for - cut two from each .
1	3I	trunc we 've trunc well , the -
1	3I	or-
1	6B	we probably do .
0	3I	oh , buckets , okay .
1	3I	item for camping , to help hold stuff down .
2	6B	sugar-free juice machines , we can can those . we talked about that . yeah , let 's get rid of those because they do n't make any money .
0	6B	to -
0	6B	to -
1	6B	helpful .
2	3I	yeah , the outdoor thing . maybe , like , underneath the siding ? i do n't know .
1	3I	yeah , yeah that 's - that sounds reasonable . yeah , exactly .
1	3I	maybe next to the paper .
2	6B	i do n't know , there 's -
0	3I	pouches of trunc
0	3I	pouches of trunc
0	6B	okay , let 's see how many -
2	3I	okay . depends on what kinda books you - okay .
2	6B	budget , so let 's take hospital additions out .
2	6B	well , i can think of - so , we -there 's some things you just ca n't cut , so -
2	3I	i thought this said thick sticks at first , and i thought that - uh , do we have a clothing trunc um let 's see - if i - well -
0	6B	uh ,  infrastructure and licensing .
2	6B	subway system kinda goes , like - is the main trunc trunc thing , and then you take buses around , like , the outsides trunc and junk . i think you need both of those .
1	3I	alright . fish hooks go fairly well with the -
0	6B	hospital additions . did we talk about that ?
0	3I	so , basically , these simulate aisles ?
2	6B	and weed control is not the same thing .
1	6B	well , trunc if i 'm limited to three , then i would probably , myself -
1	3I	do n't you think ?
0	3I	did you say bagels ?
1	3I	right here ? okay .
0	3I	well my next one -
1	3I	yeah . gas-powered cookstoves . oh , that goes near -
1	3I	eggs and beets ?
2	6B	i do n't think those should be cut .
1	3I	yeah . it 's great .
0	3I	other coats go ?
2	3I	let 's put this with the power cords .
1	3I	or should they be over -
2	6B	doing that .
1	3I	where should i put those ? maybe with like - kitchen supplies near the refrigerator magnets there .
2	3I	and socks , and vests -
0	3I	shoelaces .
0	3I	shoelaces .
0	3I	shoelaces .
0	3I	shoelaces .
0	3I	shoelaces .
0	3I	shoelaces .
0	3I	shoelaces .
0	3I	shoelaces .
0	3I	shoelaces .
2	3I	i 'd say cake mix maybe .
0	6B	what are - ? i do n't really understand what community news ads are .
0	3I	i - yeah , i do n't know .
2	6B	i do n't think that 's what that is .
1	3I	i think so . unless we go with electric heaters , but that 's more appliances . this is more -
0	6B	so there 's three .
1	3I	in the clothing .
1	3I	sticks of butter . we can put those with eggs .
1	3I	i think the five pound weights should go - oh wait . electric heater .
1	3I	hats and travel guides ?
2	6B	as can weed control .
1	6B	i do n't know . it does n't seem like it would be that big of a problem .
1	6B	public bus upkeep . i - i can keep that .
2	6B	yeah , i think so too . bring your own juice .
2	6B	not really needed .
2	3I	i think it goes miscellaneous - that 's more miscellaneous kinda stuff .
1	3I	would we wan na put that with the boating and the camping kind of items ?
1	3I	that would work . that would work .
1	6B	yeah , okay . and then neighborhood watch support .
2	6B	something in a certain field . sex ed is important . custodians are important .
3	6B	custodians , same story .
1	6B	i do n't think we need -
0	3I	not really . it looks like we have the fishing .
2	6B	i trunc said i thought kitten and puppy adoption -
2	6B	vehicles .
2	3I	and you need the tubing to cover the electrical . and the duct tape 's just practical .
2	3I	yeah , or could be over here because you 're gon na take them camping .
2	3I	seems like a camping or outdoors thing . next to -
2	3I	we should just make this whole thing , like , foods and edibles .
1	3I	another and , uh maybe yes - kind of hardware and recreation . yeah .
2	3I	yeah it would . maybe we just put it next to here . as close to the stove as we could .
0	3I	so the food seems to be over there .
0	6B	sex offender data , veteran 's medical assistance -
2	6B	well they wan na know if we say bagel like my sister does in new york city . yeah . she says bagel . needle exchange , we 'd like that . i think a sex offender database is really pretty useless quite honestly but veteran 's medal . well , you ca n't cut that cuz then the human cry would go off .
2	6B	well like , if it 's a big city , especially , they could come and get their license , and then go -
1	3I	uh , yeah .
1	6B	uh , yeah .
1	6B	i do n't think so . there 's - there 's enough .
2	3I	halfway in between ?
0	6B	um hospital additions , bagel factory inspections , needle exchange , that 's four .
1	3I	that 's a house supply , i guess with the power cords maybe ?
1	6B	go ahead and keep that .
1	3I	how bout right above empty plastic jugs ?
1	3I	tweezers . okay , now we 're getting into sundries . toilet papers - yeah .
2	6B	well i guess you 'd - you 'd probably - if it 's a - a real football stadium , and not like a high school football stadium , you 'd need like , skilled people to f-
1	6B	you go to the library . find them online .
1	6B	okay . yes . this is what you need to be doing for your baby 's health and all that . so .
0	3I	next one tweezers !
0	3I	small saws . there was another saw , right ?
2	3I	you do n't put it with - with other things , so - it gets its own section . okay , we 're done !
0	6B	so we 've got two .
1	3I	cake mix is a -
0	6B	yes . do -
1	3I	it means - means something trunc siding . where 's siding ?
1	3I	some breakfast stuff , kind of ?
2	6B	yeah , but stray cat spaying is , like , feral - is i think , like feral cats .
1	6B	depending on how much money we have to cut , i - th-
1	3I	i 'll put it here , with the box knives .
2	6B	you did n't even know what they were !
1	3I	i would put them next to the home container section .
3	6B	i do n't know about those , actually . i do n't know .
0	3I	mm . oh , yeah . uh-huh .
1	3I	yeah , that 's a good -
1	3I	random stuff , and then everything else .
1	3I	in case we get any more -
2	3I	not in the bathroom .
0	6B	like inside the hospitals ? but i dunno if it 's something different from that .
0	3I	just kinda - okay , now we have shoelaces .
1	3I	take your pick ! somewhere in here .
1	6B	vaccinations are important , job training is important , reproductive is important .
2	6B	depending on how wealthy people are .
0	3I	okay . now we have some paper bags .
1	6B	it 's very hard to get a plastic bag anymore as a matter of fact now if you -
1	6B	i think we should keep them too .
1	3I	heavy cable . let 's see how many more -
2	6B	well - this - there is n't anything that just -
3	6B	trunc i still feel like the sugar free juice machines is , like - why not just put water fountains , you know ?
0	6B	from each of the others . is that right ? cuz i think you - i think you said that .
1	3I	how bout bundles of sticks and pre-cut wood ?
0	3I	let 's see here , so -
1	3I	it 's - it 's trivial here , but i 'll just grab a couple more . hats .
1	3I	and then this at least over here looks like -
2	3I	mm , next to the beets ? or across from the soybeans ?
0	6B	trunc excuse me .
1	3I	packages of cookies trunc go with , uh - i-
1	3I	and bagels . with the - right here ?
3	6B	my opinion is to cut sex offender database and neighborhood watch support . that 's - but -
2	3I	so travel guides on like the first like full column maybe . let 's put that up - up at the top . since hats - hats go on your head .
2	6B	but if we do n't even fund licenses then people can just do whatever they want .
2	3I	yes ! yes . is it ?
1	6B	sounds good . i think that 's six from each - each category .
1	3I	that 's probably gon na to be close to the food .
0	6B	yeah , when i was a kid we were the assistant cooks .
0	6B	okay , yes .
1	3I	tool , a house tool ? yeah .
1	6B	because it 's - it a - an area where it breaks almost entirely cleanly into -
0	6B	um , sugar free - oh trunc note takers .
1	3I	yeah , that works . so we 've got scissors , loose leaf paper , large cups , and toilet paper .
0	6B	hmm , okay well -
1	3I	food , yes .
1	6B	hospitals and doctors , yeah . okay , so we 're cutting out reproductive education .
1	3I	more clothes . large vests . what 'd we do with our clothes ?
1	3I	um . i think - you may as well just put it with like - the other - like the other - like food stuffs .
1	6B	that seems -
1	6B	that might be the money for building them . or planning them . yeah .
2	6B	cuz you 'd think that would be a source of revenue for the -
1	3I	here 's your wetsuits . okay .
0	6B	public news station is -
1	3I	face cream . more bathroom stuff ?
2	3I	bag of peat moss . my favorite .
1	3I	okay . where do you think - ? just -
2	6B	you 'd have to institute a whole new set of laws .
1	3I	should be up here .
1	6B	like , the neighborhood watch support we thought was valuable for -
1	3I	maybe here ? is that okay ?
0	6B	uh , let 's see . what could we add back ? okay .
0	3I	five pound weights .
0	3I	five pound weights .
0	3I	five pound weights .
0	3I	five pound weights .
0	3I	five pound weights .
0	3I	five pound weights .
0	3I	five pound weights ?
0	6B	kay , two .
1	3I	how bout these guys ?
2	6B	yeah , that 's not something that the county would run . i mean , there 's private ones .
2	3I	i do n't like beets they 're too earthy for me-
1	3I	and - or -
1	3I	yeah . this one filled up a lot .
0	6B	kay . football equipment .
1	3I	cushions . see .
1	3I	central sets of shelving with shelves on either side . now there 's nothing put on this side of this -
1	3I	how about - under saws ?
1	3I	is this ?
0	3I	uh , sort of -
2	6B	cuz it 's , like , a combination of weird things .
2	6B	i think that the community news ads would - are like -
1	3I	cuz that could be -
2	6B	that - that might be kinda iffy . you wan na keep things up , and it 's important to keep things in good condition .
0	6B	other than - yeah . you 're gon na cut sugar-free juice and -
0	3I	so there 's -
2	3I	it 's an r_e_i_ backpack .
1	6B	do you think needle exchange could fall under s_t_d_ education ? potentially ?
2	3I	we put it trunc between the tweezers cuz this is a lot of random stuff tweezers you do n't buy all the time shoelaces you do n't buy all the time .
2	6B	well , i 'm more focused on cheaper public transit . it 's not that i have a problem with taxi stops .
1	3I	yeah , by the heavy coats ? fleece-line-
1	3I	oh ! power - power cords !
1	6B	trunc depends on how trunc large of a school , too . it could , one -
1	3I	or not ?
2	6B	companies -
1	3I	well , okay , got power cords over here .
1	6B	maybe more ?
1	3I	cables , cords , and rolls of duct tape there , but we also have boating supplies up there .
1	3I	um hm , i trunc how bout underneath cake mix ?
1	3I	might be easier if we , like , s-
1	6B	let 's trunc we 'll think about that . yeah .
1	3I	yeah . under face cream ?
2	6B	i feel like that could be potentially -
1	6B	yeah . okay , so poetry books ?
0	3I	uh , boxes of donuts .
2	6B	they 're already pretty good .
1	6B	um - boating licensing is state , not county to the best of my knowledge , although there might be some sort of fee generation that i 'm unaware of . i do n't own a boat .
2	3I	yep , it would go - yeah , it would go on this - yeah , down on this - uh , trunc refrigerator magnets ? probably on this side of it . hm .
0	3I	mm , i do n't really -
2	6B	poetry books . i love poetry but we 're removing that and what 's the other thing ? cooking classes .
1	6B	uh , regulations . we need that .
1	3I	okay , yeah . i have socks , so that should go where ever -
1	6B	lincoln and whatever , trunc are n't they all private ?
2	6B	well , we can have state banks that are n't federally controlled , that , uh , would deal in the stuff .
1	6B	bagel factory inspections i do n't know about that one .
0	3I	and i 've got pouches of oatmeal .
3	6B	flagpole repair , get out !
2	6B	i know so many music teachers . i do n't wan na cut them .
1	3I	oh , okay yes .
1	3I	um , this might go with food . i do n't really see anything else it would go with .
1	6B	i think that 's important to be funding .
1	3I	let 's shift those back . there we are .
1	6B	certain apple trees -
1	3I	that should be yeah , i think by the books .
1	6B	and we just have - we - our weed control .
0	3I	and then toys and books -
1	6B	well , i think it 's important , but again some of these things can be -
2	3I	camping stuff . and i 've got some of that . so - so - so - we could do it over here ? yeah . pre-cut wood . trunc books of matches .
2	6B	like really
2	6B	mm-mm no , cuz they can do that themselves .
0	6B	just two from each ?
1	3I	major vestment rather a -
0	6B	public health and safety .
0	6B	public health and safety .
0	6B	public health and safety .
0	6B	public health and safety .
0	6B	public health and safety .
1	3I	soybeans . we do n't know if those are -
1	3I	five pound weights . do you know what five pound weights are used for ? i certainly do n't .
1	3I	yeah yeah , think so uh , five pound weights ?
0	6B	reusable bag campaign - that 's already seven .
1	6B	plastic bags can get .
2	6B	flagpole trunc get it - get out !
2	6B	and the speed limit signs do too .
0	6B	um . dog catcher - can -
0	6B	flagpole .
2	3I	we 'll go ahead and put it with the juice and the water .
1	3I	i would have the trunc you do n't need to put sugar in cake mix , right ? cuz it 's already in there .
1	6B	i do n't know . my dogs have never run away .
2	6B	i mean , it sucks to cut recreation , but -
0	6B	and food bank .
0	3I	bundles of sticks and precut wood .
1	3I	tweezers . okay , yeah
1	3I	all by itself .
3	6B	where are the impassive -
2	3I	yeah , i normally do trader joe 's . i - i mean , trunc i think she 's listening , so i would assume - since we 're not talking about -
1	3I	oh . that 's a great idea .
0	6B	ooh .
0	3I	ooh .
1	6B	put -
1	3I	okay . sounds good to me .
1	6B	yeah . pre-natal check-ups . yeah , trunc think that 's important .
2	3I	oh , picnic supplies !
2	6B	a private towing service -
1	6B	pothole maintenance or did we talk about boating licenses ? those are needed .
2	3I	somewhere in that first aisle , i would say .
1	3I	box knives . oh well , we do have a cutting things section . how about the box knives on the - ?
1	6B	appear to be the sugar free juice machines which are -
2	3I	okay , bags of peat moss . this is definitely outdoors , like , home improvement .
1	6B	so if you got rid of that -
1	3I	i think we should put the whisky next to the - ice cream .
1	6B	we got ta come up with a second thing though , if we 're gon na stick to our two items .
0	3I	i do n't know . i do n't know if it matters .
2	3I	maybe - i feel like it should be trunc somewhere around refrigerator magnets or something .
2	6B	so i would get rid of that .
1	6B	no . no , i think - i think - yeah .
0	3I	are there any other alcoholic items ?
1	3I	that 's more - yeah , okay . let 's go - uh , that 's gardening . heavy cable . that 's kinda with this .
1	3I	by the soybeans .
1	3I	like trunc work out items . okay , wetsuits .
1	3I	these seem to got well .
0	6B	oh , i see what you mean .
1	3I	school supplies .
1	3I	school supplies !
2	6B	flagpole repair , not so important . taxi stops , not so important
0	6B	acting coaches . not every school has a drama department .
0	3I	mm-hm . packages of cookies . we had some food here , did n't we ?
1	3I	or does this mean - ?
0	6B	em .
0	3I	with - somewhere in here ?
1	3I	small saws and the - yeah . that - yeah .
1	3I	obviously in this aisle here .
0	6B	trunc screen went dark . okay . um , public news station .
0	6B	it 's sorta in between trunc okay .
0	3I	alrighty . get a couple here .
1	3I	so it 's a maintenance kind of item , but more gardening . maybe trunc you know , like . adjacent to mousetraps , but kind of ina different -
1	3I	probably go with - by the eggs . i 'm presuming .
1	3I	eggs timers would be next to eggs , maybe ?
1	6B	maybe yeah . pothole maintenance .
1	3I	what about food - stuff ?
2	6B	i 'm standing outside the grocery store . i 'm gon na call a taxi .
1	6B	and your neon bulbs -
0	3I	ooh ! paper bags .
1	6B	cool . so we 're keeping fishing licenses , public bus upkeep , drainage ditches . okay , cool ! so , we 're done .
2	3I	oh , that does make sense that this stuff is refrigerated .
0	3I	boat related things .
1	6B	i do too . i mean
2	6B	soup kitchen if we absolutely have to - no -
1	3I	oh , you 're right . that does make sense right there .
1	3I	hm . empty plastic jugs ?
1	3I	baking - ?
2	6B	that does n't seem like it should fall under our umbrella .
1	3I	dried figs is -
1	3I	okay , here 's toilet paper .
1	3I	you know where that 's got ta go .
0	6B	easiest to cut ?
2	3I	uh , a whole liter is pretty big . it could either be drinking water - we can put it over here . or it could be like for , um -
2	3I	left side of the store .
2	6B	you know , well food bank - food bank and soup kitchen trunc are different . you know ?
2	3I	well , i am gon na put my tweezers by the toilet paper .
0	3I	camp supply stuff .
1	6B	okay , so assistant cooks we 've got off . custodians ! maybe add back custodians to - for upkeep .
0	3I	and they have gas powered trunc cook stoves .
0	6B	toxic waste disposal ?
0	6B	toxic waste disposal .
2	6B	and reproductive education and the weed control .
1	6B	but they 're not vital , so that 's hard .
1	3I	perhaps -
1	3I	perhaps -
1	3I	yeah , sure . that 's good .
0	6B	chicken pox , training
2	6B	apparently . that 's the way they 're making it look .
1	6B	yeah . but i think it-
2	3I	well , m-
1	6B	over here , under -
1	3I	okay , great idea ! huh .
2	6B	i dunno . i took cooking class in high school and it was totally worthless cause -
1	6B	okay . of the trunc three trunc in that group - egg farm regulations , weed control , and pre-natal checkups .
0	6B	um , acting coaches .
2	6B	i was n't trunc we could take one thing off of each .
1	6B	each , uh -
2	3I	that would go better with toilet - yeah toilet paper , yeah . i think so , yeah .
2	6B	we have stray cat spaying , and kitten and puppy adoption , and a veterinary hospital .
0	3I	bulk cooking .
1	3I	well , you can use oatmeal to , like , make cookies . do you wan na put this , like over - cuz that 's kind of a trunc uh -
1	6B	well , there are some but -
2	6B	i think in today 's world , uh , with , uh , the number of kids that ca n't count -
2	3I	we could do this . and put them on the other side .
1	6B	or something that 's not really going to effect lives , then -
1	6B	i would keep the bus stops .
1	3I	over here , for camping , yeah .
2	6B	that 's state of washington .
2	6B	yeah , i was gon na say that one too .
1	3I	um , canned stuff - probably in here , huh ?
1	3I	sure . sounds good .
1	3I	sure . sounds good .
2	3I	or is that more over here ?
1	6B	are the custodians , all of them together .
1	6B	yes . co-mayors , yes .
2	6B	yeah . i - i - i - - yeah , the thing is we need to have them , because we got too many - too many kids that do n't have any skills .
0	6B	like whatcom county or - ?
2	6B	so where are you trunc so -
0	6B	a signing service . speed limit signs -
2	3I	boxes of doughnuts . oh , right here , package of cookies and boxes of doughnuts .
1	6B	i think that 's somewhat important .
1	6B	it is , yeah .
1	6B	it is , yeah .
0	6B	just a local cable thingy .
2	6B	yeah , but we already have sex ed -
1	3I	that 's gon na be in the -
1	6B	that 's a big ticket item , and we do n't know enough about it to know -
0	6B	mm . i do n't know .
0	6B	you 've never seen public access channel ? oh , okay .
1	3I	yeah . yeah yeah . this is , like , home depot trunc part .
1	3I	ooh ! by mousetraps ? it could go up there .
2	6B	rather than having someone else in there to take notes for the disabled person . they can just get a copy of another student 's notes .
0	6B	so trunc mm -
2	6B	dispense with teaching certificates .
1	3I	these could go near each other .
1	6B	well , i mean you ca n't stop trunc yeah , trunc it 's hard to say . yeah .
1	3I	bags of peat moss , so now we 're into gardening .
2	3I	or the fridge magnets , yes !
1	3I	here , you wan na take a stack ?
1	6B	yeah , no , we do n't need that .
0	6B	yeah . it looks like .
0	3I	alright . bagels . okay .
1	6B	sa-
0	3I	okay , we got duct tape electric heaters , and bags of peat moss .
0	6B	it does n't mean like we 're issuing it ?
1	3I	and windows .
2	3I	no , except the -
2	3I	i mean you could put the whiskey up there . it 's not like we 're doing this as a , uh , business school project . so , do you want the whiskey next to the toy ?
2	6B	uh , we outsourced the dog catcher .
1	3I	hm , probably up with the jackets and sweaters .
1	6B	okay , so we could get rid of the public access station , and let the cable stations -
1	3I	but not too close .
1	3I	sure , that 's refrigerated , right ?
1	6B	yeah , i trunc um - i - i guess i 'm not familiar with -
1	3I	yeah , i think it 's good .
1	3I	just to create a little room
1	3I	let 's fill in between toilet paper and refrigerator magnets .
1	6B	um - i actually some time ago i worked for the city .
1	3I	oh well .
0	3I	jackets .
1	3I	it probably does n't -
1	3I	cuz they can be used in any of those place .
1	3I	a household disposable personal toiletry .
1	6B	maybe not . i would probably cut the access station first .
0	3I	boxes of donuts ! maybe -
2	3I	it 's gon na be bad .
0	3I	we 're trunc flags .
2	3I	but what about eggs and dairy ? yeah .
1	3I	well , , i think we 're done !
1	6B	this is gon na be the hard one .
1	6B	this is gon na be the hard one .
1	6B	the state - this county does not do teaching certificates .
2	6B	as long as not upkeeping the football stadium does n't mean it falls to bits -
1	6B	so that 's two we can get rid of .
0	3I	oh , we are ?
1	6B	yeah it 's
1	6B	okay . so you - okay , okay .
2	6B	they should just have like a little picture of like -
1	6B	we ca n't move em to another department can we ?
2	6B	self sustaining though ?
1	3I	oh , yeah , perfect . yeah , it 's , like , kitchen stuff .
1	6B	i thought maybe the taxi stops .
2	6B	trunc let 's only consider the ones that -
1	3I	ingredients , so - okay , canvas bags . how bout the travel trunc well either boating - yeah , the boating . yeah . i think that 's a good idea . wetsuits , there you go . right .
1	6B	uh , we could trunc well -
1	6B	yes . we do n't want the trunc toilets to overflow .
1	3I	and i do n't much care where . do you think - care where ?
1	3I	well , i think it should go there in the trunc somewhere in - maybe on trunc i do n't know , this side , maybe down - .
1	6B	looking at the list , um - the immediate uh -
0	6B	so , we cut -
1	3I	we trunc we did n't talk about where we 're gon na put clothing .
1	6B	yeah . mm-hm .
1	3I	yeah . mm-hm .
1	3I	yeah . mm-hm .
1	6B	so , axe it ?
1	3I	construction equipment .
1	3I	saws ? yes , trunc yeah - yeah , either place . ye-
0	6B	so it 's only this category that we need to cut more .
2	3I	wetsuits with the boats .
1	6B	like cleaning the toilets and all the - keeping the bathrooms clean , and all that kind of stuff that is necessary .
2	6B	that 's kinda fun .
2	6B	that 's so random . yeah , i feel like - why would we - ?
0	6B	food bank , junior soccer league -
1	3I	tweezers . that 's , like -
2	6B	everything else seems pretty darn important .
0	6B	we got two , two , and two .
0	3I	the camping area -
0	6B	what are hunting tags ?
0	3I	a trunc yeah . thank you . an ingredient as opposed to something that 's already -
2	6B	trunc i could see getting rid of the reusable bag campaign . although - although , as a public service campaign -
1	3I	trunc yeah somewhere in that first aisle .
1	6B	although , i do also - recognize that it 's -
1	6B	which one of those two ? or maybe find a third one easier .
1	3I	canned goods .
1	3I	like , dried - yeah trunc put it with the dry stuff .
2	6B	well , yeah . trunc so , you need to change the law at the federal level .
1	3I	refrigerator ?
1	3I	light jackets , along with heavy coats .
1	3I	i think on the far aisle here .
0	6B	right . but , how much hunting can you do in a place where there 's also subway system ? i do n't understand where we are right now .
2	6B	if you 're like trying to do a campaign .
0	6B	we 're done really .
2	3I	i could actually -
1	6B	right ? it 's probably only that one . uh , needle exchange .
2	3I	socks . clothes .
0	6B	if they 're out running around .
1	3I	oh , i do n't know which one this goes on someone 's back .
1	3I	in here somewhere .
1	3I	up there .
1	3I	up there .
0	3I	hm , tow ropes . uh -
0	6B	i do n't know how much is there but -
0	6B	okay , so we have -
1	3I	yes . we do .
1	6B	so those are the only two that i can see that we agree on so far .
1	6B	yeah , that means that , yeah . they keep knocking them down and trunc stuff .
1	3I	which seems like they go well sort of -
0	6B	where 'd you go for high school ?
1	6B	yeah , and it 's something that you can it depends on what you 're funding . if you 're funding somebody to organize it or make it happen . it still happens .
1	6B	we do n't - kay , we do n't need those . okay . additional bus stops ?
0	3I	where 'd i put the - here they go .
1	3I	yeah ? okay . how bout - how bout -
1	6B	guess that 's it .
1	3I	do you have a - a rope , spool , and coil section ?
1	3I	we going up or down ?
1	3I	with the beans , maybe ?
1	6B	okay , so taxis , yeah okay . i think we 're good !
1	6B	yeah . cooking classes . uh , note takers , disability services , um -
0	6B	and - let 's see . kitten and puppy adoption , stray cat spaying those -
0	3I	what was that , oatmeal ?
1	6B	for , like , cheaper than joining , like , a y_m_c_a_ . um , so that might be nice . i do n't know , i have n't read the - gon na read the other ones .
0	6B	we decided .
2	6B	yeah , get rid of that oh good , this is becoming easier .
2	3I	will that work ?
1	6B	i know i save them like precious little -
2	6B	yeah . we 'll cut that . cuz trunc that sorta makes it sound like it 's a gift certificate .
1	3I	the half good for you we 'll put here . how 's that ? flags ?
1	3I	here we go .
1	6B	oh . i dunno .
1	3I	in two okay .
1	6B	is it essential ?
0	3I	liters of water .
0	3I	liters of water .
0	3I	liters of water .
0	3I	liters of water .
0	3I	liters of water .
0	3I	liters of water ?
0	3I	liters of water .
0	3I	liters of water .
0	3I	liters of water ?
0	3I	liters of water .
0	3I	liters of water .
0	3I	liters of water .
0	3I	liters of water .
0	3I	liters of water .
0	3I	liters of water .
0	3I	liters of water .
2	3I	bagels . large vests , i 'm gon na put that here with the - with clothing .
2	6B	so i think keep that . keep the vaccinations .
1	3I	okay . and i got -
2	3I	flags would be with the pet food .
1	3I	mm-kay , electric heaters .
0	6B	infrastucture and licensing .
2	3I	very tasty .
1	3I	okay , because that -
2	6B	broke down -
1	3I	mm . yeah i guess so .
2	3I	close to that .
0	3I	trunc is there - trunc was there more bread stuff ? do you remember ?
1	6B	okay , so - okay . trunc okay . trunc okay . so - sure 
1	6B	or we could be more -
2	6B	tax money .
1	6B	yeah , you want that kinda monitored . i agree . i agree with that .
3	6B	towing services could probably get cut also . massage certificates . probably cut massage certificates before tattoo artists . but - taxi stops . why is the government making taxi stops anyway ?
2	6B	maybe i would n't cut it , just make em more expensive .
2	3I	wetsuits . now that 's gon na be -
1	6B	yeah , we 're a county committee .
1	6B	that 's probably a good thing to have .
1	6B	betcha we could cut public news station and keep the public access - access station .
1	6B	they do . really fast .
0	6B	yeah , i noticed in the - in the - first activity .
0	6B	and we decided what to keep and what not to keep on there . um -
2	3I	oh . we 'll just do that . but here - here -
2	6B	cuz you can get students to volunteer to do that .
0	6B	uh , football stadium upkeep -
1	6B	that seems pretty important .
0	3I	um , five-pound weights .
0	3I	um , five-pound weights ?
1	6B	co-
1	3I	so it 's gon na be arbitrary . is what it comes down to . we could have it -
1	3I	so it 's kinda like in this little - loose leaf paper , maybe books .
1	6B	cat spaying , puppy adoption , and the reusable bag campaign .
1	6B	it sounds like weed control is the one to go .
1	6B	so , maybe cut that one from our public service type thing ?
0	3I	i 've got fleece lined boots .
1	3I	yeah . that 's perfect .
2	6B	and then the other one that i think was the most obvious was the towing services .
2	6B	the dog catcher does n't do that .
2	3I	that 's true . it depends on the kinda shoes , right ?
2	6B	they have to know about it .
2	3I	your
1	6B	but we want that so things do n't get outta control .
1	3I	bars of soap . with this other bathroom stuff right here ?
1	3I	outdoorsy things ?
0	6B	tattoo artist licenses ?
0	6B	tattoo artist licenses ?
2	6B	i think again , i can trade off more for the hospital additions .
0	3I	they were with toys in my store , earlier .
1	3I	and then that wants to know about dried figs . would we want to store those or eat them sooner ?
1	3I	where 's the small saws ? down here . okay . yeah , that might be a good idea .
1	3I	i 'd put them - yeah . i 'd put them on the -
1	3I	saw ? saws ? yeah . whoops .
2	6B	is providing , um - uh , education a-
1	3I	trunc put it on trunc yeah , that 's what i was just gon na say . if we have more bathroom stuff , we can put it there . and then bucket - i ca n't read - bundles of sticks . let 's put it up here with the pre-cut wood .
0	3I	box .
1	6B	alright , so let 's look at the first one and see if there 's anything that we can agree on , first column -
1	6B	yeah . so we got ta get rid of one on the other side .
1	3I	we could have it at the top of that aisle .
1	3I	bottles of juice . i think that could go down here .
0	6B	a few at the top that -
0	6B	and massage certificates ?
1	3I	i guess over there .
0	3I	fresh -
1	3I	what about beets ? maybe here ?
2	3I	yeah . yeah , yeah ! that - i think that looks better .
2	6B	they all are .
1	3I	we 're down to these things again , here . right there .
2	6B	okay . sexually transmitted disease education . gone . although under public health you know what they do .
1	3I	with the boating supplies .
1	6B	yeah . i do n't really care . i would n't ever use it myself , so -
2	3I	okay , i think that 's - we 've done it !
2	3I	all the other utility stuff .
2	6B	so we can keep the -
0	3I	i would guess five-pound weights - they 're - that 's trunc that 's too much for , like , a fishing weight , so i would have to guess it 's , like , a dumbbell for weightlifting kinda thing .
1	3I	yes , we have the power to decide which ones we ordered .
2	3I	i dunno , i think i 'm - interested in cake right now .
0	6B	get on . yeah . one in the nude as i recall .
1	3I	bagels would be -let 's start a , um -
1	6B	cooking -
2	3I	we gon na put all of them up there .
2	3I	oh , okay . otherwise we could put clothes going down here .
1	6B	and our third thing we came up with was - was it dog catcher ?
1	6B	so , i trunc yeah . so , i would - i would say four if you took trunc uh , just arbitrarily , assuming that -
0	3I	box knives . i wonder if they 're talking about kitchen knives , or - ?
2	6B	i think we might need those .
1	3I	house - siding ? buckets ?
0	3I	the paper -
2	6B	removed -
1	3I	boxes of donuts . okay let 's put - let 's put with ice cream , cuz we 're in more with the treats .
0	6B	alright , uh , needle exchange ? oh .
0	6B	um , egg farm , five , weed control , six -
1	3I	how - p how bout above tow ropes ?
0	3I	i did n't know that they sold empty plastic jugs .
1	3I	dried figs . that 's pretty healthy .
1	3I	put it by the -
1	3I	uh , sticks of butter , maybe down by the eggs and bagels .
1	3I	okay , let 's do that .
1	3I	okay . let 's do that .
2	6B	but - we do n't - have to - discuss that too much . cuz i agree with you . trunc trunc no - like that 's - i 'm -
1	6B	i do n't think .
1	6B	i do n't think .
0	6B	cooking classes , and , um -
2	6B	and breakfast programs . so , yeah .
1	3I	yeah . trunc
1	3I	oh , we need sorta household office , do n't we ?
1	3I	it 's kind of random
1	3I	as a , um , personal hygiene item .
0	3I	did they have , like , gloves or shirts ?
2	3I	now put the sticks and the wood together .
1	3I	wherever we want them .
3	6B	how many people are we putting out of a job if we cut that ? like one his name is larry and he works part time . i think trunc it 's okay if we get rid of the flag pole repair .
1	3I	well maybe by the siding . that seems like a outdoorsy -
1	6B	teaching certificates ? yes . speed limit signs ?
2	3I	well , no , think about what else was on the list . you had whiskey , cake , beets , sugar , butter .
2	6B	who had introduction to , like -
2	6B	yeah . so no more towing services .
1	6B	assistant cooks . yeah .
1	3I	that 's kind of like a instant food .
1	3I	cups as a buffer ? or something ?
1	3I	there trunc are right there , yeah .
2	6B	there 's pass the buck .
0	6B	okay , recreation and public services . i got ta read this .
0	6B	public bus upkeep , and drainage ditches -
0	6B	so we have to -
0	6B	the three to get rid of ?
2	6B	i 'd say get rid of s_t_d_ since it should be covered in reproductive .
2	6B	so then we 're down to three . so then we keep the coach .
0	6B	what 's the difference between a food bank and a soup kitchen ? i guess a soup kitchen you come in , you get a hot meal , and a food bank you get supplies to cook at home .
2	6B	the - the you know . anyway . that trunc that could go uh -
1	3I	like , with scissors and stuff ?
2	3I	maybe i 'm grabbing more than i should . loose leaf paper . um -
1	3I	boating trunc
1	6B	skip it and come back ? okay . boys basketball club .
1	6B	maybe we should decide a couple to - we can talk though them all , but we can decide maybe a couple to cut . like maybe two to cut . from each category .
1	3I	yeah , start a new one down here .
2	6B	oh ! c_ span . yeah . i love that .
1	3I	like , the dried foods , or maybe - since it 's a bread , maybe by cake mix ?
1	3I	and then we 've got toilet paper so -
2	6B	uh do we really need to campaign over it anymore ?
1	3I	next to the beverages .
1	3I	trunc next to the eggs .
1	3I	cool . yeah , like supplies and stuff .
2	6B	okay so i feel like we could probably take out both the s_t_d_ education and the reproductive education if we 're gon na keep sex ed over here .
0	3I	liters of water and bottles of juice .
2	6B	yeah , absolutely have to have that .
2	6B	because it handles the trunc animals .
2	6B	yeah , i ca n't cut that .
1	3I	let 's um -
0	6B	so , how many should we cut from - ?
1	3I	yeah , this might help us .
0	6B	yeah , trunc trunc we 're accepting pest control . we 've got three out of there so , we 're going - okay .
2	6B	now , why do we have to pay for taxi stops ?
2	6B	you ca n't . it 's pretty helpful .
2	6B	alright , that 's five ! we 're good .
2	3I	there 's also probably face cream .
2	6B	oi .
1	3I	bagels - yeah , with the breakfast .
0	6B	what was the one i was looking at ?
0	3I	oo .
0	3I	oo .
0	3I	oo .
0	3I	oo .
1	6B	speed limit signs definitely .
1	3I	bundles of sticks . yeah .
2	6B	well , fortunately , it seems like we have similar values . so this could be easier .
1	6B	uh , i was gon na say cooking classes . but that 's i guess that 's actually really useful stuff . i - i grew up with that and , i mean , our high school had home ec . yeah .
0	3I	so , the -
1	6B	they clean up the rooms . of course that does n't explain who 's gon na do the -
1	3I	probably , yeah .
1	6B	probably , yeah .
1	3I	probably , yeah .
1	3I	probably . yeah .
0	6B	what do you trunc what do you suggest ?
0	6B	oh , we must discuss each item . okay . okay . okay , just kidding . so , math tutors .
2	6B	ah . dang . okay .
0	6B	three for that w-
2	3I	just cause this is the random -
2	6B	no , we can get rid of em keep that .
1	6B	i dunno . cuz we have something for cats . stray cat spaying .
2	6B	yes . totally
0	3I	let 's see what we have now .
1	3I	could be over here some place , huh ?
1	3I	your toothpaste , your water trunc jugs . water jugs up here by boating ?
2	6B	there 's a list of - i know , because i know how they handle this , but there 's a list of , like , all the local towing -
2	6B	it 's probably safer to get one with someone who 's licensed ? but maybe you should just do trunc your research before doing it anyway .
1	3I	oh of the - the dried figs we just kind of like eh . you do n't belong with anyone .
0	6B	i do n't even understand what - is this like a program where they train assistant cooks ?
1	6B	okay , i would do - we 'll do weed control .
1	3I	got ta get your water and your whiskey at the same time .
1	3I	so now we kinda know the categories . should we take these outta the box first and organize them into categories ?
1	6B	uh yeah , i - the - the three low end things i could definitely get rid of would be -
1	6B	is there anything else we think we can safely cut off the , uh , educational programs list ?
2	6B	i do n't know . i never got a vaccination .
0	6B	all over .
1	3I	that would make sense , huh ?
1	3I	that works for me .
1	6B	i definitely agree there .
0	6B	we were gon na take out -
1	3I	bait .
2	3I	yeah , i was wondering that too . i bet if we crammed the hardware store things there , we could .
1	3I	an electric heater . would that go -
1	3I	or the whiskey .
1	6B	i 'd take out - trunc how much does that cost ?
2	3I	so we have half inch tubing over there by the siding .
2	6B	what 's that ?
1	6B	yeah . acting coaches ?
0	6B	is that our three ? okay .
1	3I	yeah , yeah , this trunc that looks good .
0	6B	then we have music teachers .
1	6B	or what - what 's the rest of your thinking about - ?
0	6B	licenses , like boating licenses and stuff , is that - would that mean that -
1	3I	yeah , cuz it - this is - yeah , i do . hardware ?
1	6B	than reproductive education , right ?
1	3I	okay , how bout right there ?
1	3I	we put empty -
2	6B	i guess to me on the - you know on maslow 's hierarchy - it 's sort of like -
2	6B	that do that .
1	3I	with the toilet paper .
1	6B	yeah , yeah . mm-kay we did three there . three there . okay . oh .
2	3I	the way they work those is all the juices and all that , you wan na whole - on - on a whole aisle by themselves , usually , in the stores .
0	6B	so , out of that list - ?
2	3I	squeeze it in .
2	3I	here 's bundles of sticks , small axes , and power cords . maybe we should just put em there .
1	6B	sounds kind of important .
1	3I	beets , maybe with the -
2	6B	oh , licensing . well , pothole maintenance we definitely need . uh .
1	6B	hurting like native plants . then -
2	6B	important .
2	6B	okay , so assistant cooks is a possibility to cut , right ?
1	6B	you need -
1	3I	can of peas . let 's put it with the beets .
1	3I	yeah . face cream .
2	6B	then again , if it 's these brand new helmets for - you know - to supposedly minimize the um -
1	3I	do we want to go down from the power cords , or up , or on both sides , or -
1	6B	boy 's basketball club .
1	3I	oh , i do n't know . i was gon na say by the refrigerator magnet , and random -
1	3I	hm , would that be a camping supply ?
1	3I	should we put clothes in the middle ?
1	6B	i trunc i think that 's right .
1	3I	on this side ?
0	3I	with the books .
1	3I	that 's sort of a -
1	6B	math tutors sounds pretty essential .
2	3I	ropes . or by the axes , or whatever .
1	6B	we could trunc keep the sugar-free juice machines .
1	3I	totally .
0	6B	housing assistance , dog catcher , boys basketball club , public access t_v_ , public access station , veterinary hospital , football stadium upkeep -
0	3I	okay . flags .
0	6B	trunc so -
2	6B	we can come back to it .
1	6B	think that 's important .
1	3I	kay rolls of duct tape .
1	6B	mm-kay . are we good ?
2	3I	especially if you 're , like , looking for matches or something trunc like , weird .
0	3I	alright , so the , uh -
1	6B	well maybe they inspect them for kosherness , i dunno .
2	3I	yeah , how about across from the toothpaste ?
2	3I	i know . i know . i do n't know if ours is any better .
1	3I	boat stuff .
2	6B	nobody watches it .
1	3I	or i do n't know .
1	3I	i do n't know , but fish hooks look like your side .
2	6B	reproductive education . how is that different from sex ed ?
2	6B	trunc and i know that acting is one of those arts , but i -
2	6B	you know . there trunc there - there are laws out there that are not enforced all the time .
1	3I	yeah . i completely agree .
0	3I	and then i - egg timers .
1	3I	oh man , okay do we use it in our last little - ?
1	3I	yeah books , that works .
2	6B	okay , i still think we can get rid of sex ed because we got it over there under reproductive health . ?
2	6B	you know , urinated in public a few too many times . and they 're registered as a sex offender .
1	3I	i have five pound weights , and i think those go with mouse traps , or boating supplies . somewhere on this side .
1	3I	oh , that 's true that 's true , yeah yeah . let 's do that . yeah , that 's good .
2	6B	one of those two things i think the county should keep .
1	6B	music teachers ? yeah .
1	3I	loose-leaf paper that 's a odd - right . um -
1	3I	okay . shoelaces .
0	3I	of food items , but i do n't see the food items here . trunc i do n't think they 're -
0	6B	and infrastructure ?
1	3I	let 's see - wetsuits . which are more recreational than just regular clothing so le-
1	3I	okay i 'll put it across from scissors .
1	3I	now large cups , is that for the camping stuff ? or maybe with paper bags ?
1	6B	one that you wan na cut .
2	3I	okay , see the problem here is th-
2	6B	the subway system has to stay .
1	3I	and this is all - like - clothing stuff , yeah ? okay .
1	3I	uh , are -
1	3I	everything store . they 're not -
1	3I	um , by the bags of peat moss ?
1	3I	put em with camping .
2	3I	tow ropes i think that should be over here . that 's a heavy duty thing .
1	3I	where 's the tweezers ? yeah , it 's kind of household .
2	3I	uh , yeah , or be by -
1	3I	yeah . huh .
1	3I	yeah . huh .
1	6B	right , exactly .
1	6B	how many stray dogs are there ?
1	6B	that 's how i trunc read that .
2	6B	that they hold a certificate in the class in which they are teaching , because we got too many teachers who are putting classes they 're not qualified to teach .
1	3I	alright . um , well -
2	6B	it 's in the news , even . i think that 's -
1	3I	um , fantastic question .
1	3I	well , we have small axes .
2	6B	the massage certificates can go away .
2	6B	get filled up . soup kitchens , yeah .
1	3I	hold on .
1	6B	uh , yes , i believe i would . we got two gone already , do n't we ? huh .
2	6B	good recommendations . all done .
2	6B	i do n't like cutting the arts .
1	3I	and then small saws and small axes maybe ? or are we running outta - ? oh , going up ?
2	3I	in anticipation of wanting to put the clothes next to each other .
0	6B	uh , so , no more acting coaches . poetry books .
1	3I	okay , so let 's do half-inch tubing . i 'm assuming this is for , like -
0	6B	no we did n't . um .
0	3I	and empty plastic jugs .
1	3I	with boating supplies .
2	3I	large stores together before .
1	3I	yeah . that 's fine . okay .
0	6B	uh , teaching certificates .
2	6B	you 'd think so . yeah .
0	6B	uh , trunc let 's see . there was a - another kinda tree .
2	6B	well , trunc no , just bagel factories , it 's obviously what it says , so that must be what it is .
1	6B	yes . so .
0	3I	we do n't have that yet .
1	3I	ca n't help it .
1	3I	i think it 's fine there .
2	6B	veterans medical assistance is - uh , the united states government does that , so cut that . that not a county deal !
2	6B	oh , this is really hard .
1	6B	we 'll cut that one . i think that 's gon na be our one .
1	3I	the - that would go with - trunc i 'd say that goes with eggs .
1	6B	they 're all gon na trunc be important .
1	3I	you think i can stick it there ?
1	3I	things that you use in your house , or your farm , or whatever that are not -
2	3I	i 'd say over here , - i would say over by the boating supplies .
2	6B	i do n't think that 's as important because -
2	6B	i 'm guessing that 's what that is . foodbanks are essential .
1	3I	with the food ? sure . any particular place ?
1	3I	what do you do with a bag of peat moss ?
0	3I	um hm !
0	3I	where 'd we put that siding ?
1	6B	um , music teachers . i think that 's really important .
2	3I	let 's put it on the boat .
1	3I	let 's put it down here with the pre-cut wood .
1	6B	quite likely , so -
0	6B	we 're down to only two items , but -
1	6B	okay , we 're cutting .
2	3I	cuz i - you know - trunc i do n't think there was any rule that said -
1	3I	other stuff .
1	3I	siding or power cords ?
1	6B	work parties . sort of adopt a park , or adopt a something and they can go out an do the weed control .
1	3I	i think i 'd put it next to here , with all our sharp things .
1	3I	hardware . okay , yeah . yeah , okay uh .
1	6B	yeah , additional bus stops . mm-hm .
2	3I	yeah ! yeah yeah . kind of surprise them . i read some - or , heard some interesting things about trunc the flow of traffic in - in grocery stores . people will always tend to , like - trunc i forget if it was -
1	3I	but maybe . yeah .
2	6B	there 's already - well , see we can talk about - about our own communities , cuz it 's like in seattle we have boys and girls clubs with all that stuff .
1	6B	you know . i 'd - i 'd have - yeah . okay , so the next are public -
1	3I	would you wan na just put those on either side of it ? i do n't see any other food . there 's liquor but -
2	6B	the city bus could -
1	6B	sure . public health and safety . reproductive education , job training programs , chicken pox vaccinations -
2	3I	trunc no , technically you already put it up , so you ca n't move it .
0	3I	box knives
0	6B	on the east coast they have trunc some places they have specific like - this is a taxi stop and then all the taxi trunc drivers will pull up and you can like get on .
1	3I	trunc how about up here ?
1	3I	start one up there ?
1	3I	mm-kay , so these first .
0	3I	gas-powered cookstoves . maybe -
2	6B	yeah . pothole maintenance . oh god , yes please . i - i hate potholes . unless there 's - unless there 's something we can lump it under .
1	3I	i - yeah - i - i would agree , somewhere in this column is about right . sure .
0	3I	go ahead .
0	3I	go ahead .
2	3I	yeah , or it could go here .
0	3I	okay , paper bags .
1	3I	how bout here ? yeah . small saws near the -
2	3I	for the parents to shop .
1	3I	perhaps near the books , and what is shaping up to be the school supply section .
2	6B	so we can keep that . special ed teachers , i think are necessary definitely .
0	6B	like , uh , public television .
1	6B	the taxi stops and the additional bus stops .
0	6B	i did n't even know that - the tattoo artists had to be licensed .
1	6B	housing assistance ? yes . dog catcher ? sure . boys basketball club .
1	3I	yeah.
1	6B	think more of an education and programs .
1	3I	yeah . yeah , put it there . yeah , it 's fine .
0	3I	home supplies . right .
1	3I	saws , right -
3	3I	specific . we can put that next to socks !
1	3I	together like - sweet things -
1	6B	excellent work .
1	6B	um sure .
1	3I	you need the box knies to cut the duct tape !
2	3I	how we doing ? looks like we 've got lots of space there . so then i think we should do -
2	6B	ca n't trunc ca n't buy housing , and -
1	6B	uh , needle exchange is good .
2	3I	we did n't move anything !
0	6B	right . reusable - reusable bag .
2	3I	boy it could use some colors this is really -
2	6B	i 'm - i 'm thinking about that , maybe a little bit differently , is because -
0	3I	butter
2	6B	that definitely needs to stay . um , boating licenses , tattoo artist licenses -
1	3I	let 's put it - across from the beets .
1	6B	how many do we have to get rid of ? why do n't we just get rid of one outta each one call it the budget . did they say how many we have to do ?
2	6B	yeah , books are pretty cheap , though . comparatively .
2	3I	not finished products could go between it and sugar . is that what you 're thinking ? i mean not - not these cuz those are made and those are made , or what are you thinking ?
1	6B	we could do maybe -
1	3I	um yeah , maybe put them next to the boots . the fleece-lined boots , because we 're getting into , like -
1	3I	maybe somewhere in this , like , zone ?
0	3I	empty plastic jugs . um -
2	3I	ooh yeah . oh yeah .
1	6B	i 'm willing to trunc uh , to get rid of the football equipment , even though i know sports are a big money earner . um -
0	6B	massage certificate .
2	3I	face cream that 's gon na be with the bathroom stuff , yeah okay , sticks of butter ! that 's baking .
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs ? next to -
2	3I	i know mousetraps are usually for indoors , but -
0	6B	so assistant cooks . um . speech therapy .
1	6B	i 'm thinking like -
1	3I	we 'll just start talking to the ice cream .
2	3I	i think the best thing would be to put them -
1	3I	suppose we can just make a place . so i think - like the sides count as aisles too .
2	6B	there 's like no funding that really needs to go to that .
2	6B	dah that 's okay .
1	6B	so there 's not much hunting in the county .
1	6B	well i do n't know .
2	6B	yeah . it 's stupid . it 's unnecessary .
1	6B	okay . we 're not done yet valerie .
0	6B	and the football equipment .
2	3I	i suspect that we are dealing with the same list that we had or roughly the same list that we had in our first one . so as i recall there were -
1	3I	near the cake mix and the butter .
1	3I	tee and half inch tubing - and duct tape - i would think like heavy cable -
1	3I	tow ropes . well , we do have -
1	3I	bulk non-perishable , or we could make the beets less lonely . they 're both vegetables .
0	3I	box knives , chocolate bars , tweezers , and mint toothpaste .
1	3I	how about - ?
1	3I	how about - ?
1	6B	okay okay , so there 's our seven .
2	3I	or just somewhere - just somewhere up in that category . yeah .
1	3I	trunc supplies .
0	6B	and they have to say well -
1	3I	might be a form of clothing .
1	6B	well that 's true .
1	6B	well that 's true .
2	6B	football stadium upkeep ? here 's my idea .
2	3I	uh , well there 's gon na end up being a gap . we ca n't move that .
0	6B	one -
0	3I	okay , egg timer .
0	6B	trunc public news is like n_p_r_ ? i mean , just what 's the difference between public access and public news ?
1	6B	uh , damaging programs .
1	6B	cuz we 've got housing assistance , so which is more valuable ? the soup kitchens are sorta for the homeless people more so , and the food bank is more for people who have a place to cook .
2	6B	yeah , but it does n't - i mean bakeries are bakeries and , you know they - they do n't -
1	3I	down here ? soy beans ?
1	3I	yeah . you do .
2	3I	with the thick sweaters and heavy coats , maybe ?
1	6B	issue . this is true
1	3I	um , maybe just right up here ?
1	6B	i mean , um -
0	3I	yeah , where is that ? oh .
0	3I	trunc packages of cookies .
0	6B	i 'm not sure either . the only thing i can think of is like -
0	6B	right . so now we have two -
1	6B	yeah . junior soccer league .
2	3I	i know . okay . should i just pick something now ?
1	3I	next to the heavy cables , do you think ?
2	6B	hoo . yeah , well it should n't be ever done . uh -
1	6B	they do n't light up and - change .
0	3I	cushions for desk chairs .
1	6B	hunting tags , that 's -
0	3I	oh , box knives .
1	3I	above it or below it ?
1	6B	so the reusable bag campaign -
2	6B	get your own trunc !
2	3I	uh - shh .
2	3I	i think they 're more recreational , which is why i 'd put it up here . and this is more , like , i need to build my house .
1	3I	yeah that 's -
2	6B	i do n't know how necessary the coaches are - in education . because drama teachers usually -
2	3I	we could , or they could be over in the working tool thing .
1	3I	stuff like that somewhere , i thought . no we do n't .
1	6B	i do n't think we trunc dog catcher -
0	6B	transit in this area , so -
0	6B	trunc community news ads and taxi stops .
1	3I	yeah . i trunc feel like it could go in either one of these .
1	3I	just one cup of sugar .
1	6B	cut the whole program ?
2	6B	sex offender database is -
0	6B	tutors .
1	3I	that would n't be too out of place if it was by well - it could go down here for the bundles of wood ?
0	3I	well , we see sugar and cake mix , um -
2	6B	uh - let 's get rid of the neighborhood watch support .
2	3I	cuz this could be , like , kind of a tool wrap around , or -
0	6B	little more under infrastructure .
2	3I	so we 'll put that with the canvas bags . it 's looking like it 's just things that carry other things .
2	3I	um , sure !
2	6B	um . i mean , if i knew more about bagel factories , i would know how important , um , the inspections are . why that is picked . is it picked ? did they stick it on there just because it was a stand-out that was an obvious one ?
1	3I	large cups , okay .
0	6B	i wonder what it means by additions . like , a new building ? like , new -
1	6B	yeah , that 's it , yeah .
1	3I	yeah , it 's okay . alright , i think - you think we 're done ?
1	6B	yeah , we could add - we could add back the dog catcher , basketball and the soccer .
0	3I	aside so -
1	6B	that does .
0	6B	invasive species removal , s_t_d_ education , toxic waste disposal -
1	3I	so maybe that 's here ? yeah .
0	6B	alright , so -
1	3I	okay . we did n't leave very much room for books .
1	6B	yeah . and that it 's - that - in fact -
2	6B	that are out there wandering around now - i had a bank teller who could n't count , by the way . about three weeks ago , yeah . i had to tell her - tell her she ca n't count .
1	3I	i would put it maybe over -
2	6B	and for the most part people do n't know their neighbors anymore anyway .
1	3I	how bout with uh . pre-cut wood ?
1	6B	like on the fence , maybe with that one ? okay .
0	3I	juice , water , whisky .
2	3I	alright , now . large cups . and i think that goes by toilet paper . i 'm assuming these are paper cups .
1	3I	oh yeah , true .
1	6B	non-profit self supporting kinds of things .
1	6B	looks like we could do the -
1	3I	consider it done .
1	3I	maybe here ? or here ?
1	6B	paradise
1	6B	awesome . very good . done .
0	3I	lem me grab a few more things off this truck .
1	6B	important either .
1	6B	that seems kind of important .
0	3I	there . that might help us .
0	3I	yeah , we have a lot in this one .
1	3I	yeah , do they mean like - ? it probably does n't - i would say by the power cords .
0	3I	so we have tow ropes .
0	3I	they 're not disposable .
1	6B	and the custodians do - do n't they do facilities management and stuff like that too ? it 's not just -
2	3I	have a wood section ? cuz here comes bundles of sticks i 'm not quite sure what we use bundles of stick for . bars of soap . maybe they 're in the kitchen ? and now we got our first food . canned peas , right by the soy , legumes together . so why would you sell empty plastic - ? maybe it is camping . uh , so if i were going camping i 'd be traveling .
1	6B	we know there are cooks , and what you 're thinking is well cooks will have to work harder and they may not get all the food out . i remember now , you 're interested in food . that might not be -
2	3I	so , here we got the cooking supplies for food . and here we 've got the edible stuff . so maybe liters of water -
1	3I	across from the stoves ?
0	3I	kay , books .
1	6B	i dunno . i mean - i guess , well - i dunno .
2	6B	because if the public bus is stuck -
1	6B	okay , that 's a good trunc okay trunc
1	3I	um yeah . perfect .
0	3I	tweezers
1	3I	well , i would put it here . trunc
1	3I	okay , bundles of sticks . i think this goes with mouse traps . it 's sort - well it 's because , um , i think these bundles of sticks are for starting fires . and it 's sort of -
0	6B	adoption . um . dog catcher . basketball .
0	3I	bars of soap . okay , now we 're getting to more -
2	3I	i have packages of cookies , socks , rolls of duct tape , and bottle of juice . i would put the cookies with the -
0	3I	s-
1	3I	yeah . that makes sense to me .
1	3I	yeah . that makes sense to me .
0	3I	so clothing -
1	3I	well , by refrigerator magnets , are we gon na add ?
0	6B	and on the fourth one we came up with -
2	3I	trunc chocolate bars , that should go food , here .
0	6B	and our - there we go . taxi stops , fishing licenses -
2	6B	i trunc i would n't take out anything on that list if i could help it .
0	3I	they have it -
1	3I	yeah . you want this to be , like , household ?
2	6B	if it 's a time of cuts , it might not be time to make an addition , too .
1	3I	my first is to put them with here , but i wan na make sure they trunc cans , okay .
1	3I	cable , tubing tape .
0	6B	veterans medical assistant , trunc egg farm regulations , weed control , prenatal check-ups , neighborhoods watch support .
2	6B	yes . i say yes .
0	3I	i-
1	3I	yeah . tow ropes .
0	6B	teaching trunc
1	3I	yeah . in fact let 's - yeah . we could trunc well , yeah . that 's good . it 's all in that general area .
0	6B	um . in under public health .
2	6B	trunc you pay your - your employee -
1	6B	to do that .
1	6B	trunc yeah , nuke it i 'd say get rid of it .
1	6B	let 's - let 's take the football stadium upkeep off and let them do their own .
1	3I	electric heaters above that .
1	6B	i think that 's a little better . music teachers .
1	3I	well like - oh wait . you were saying whisky and the ice cream , right ?
2	6B	and so is - chicken pox vaccinations , right ? and i should probably stop , um , mumbling ! i 'll speak louder .
1	3I	pet food .
1	3I	pet food .
0	3I	there 's only one side to each - or , i guess there 's two sides .
2	6B	you can still have a drama program - yeah - without that , right ?
2	6B	i mean the y_m_c_a_ has their own and - we do n't need a county one .
1	3I	yeah . um , books .
0	6B	mm-yeah .
0	6B	uh invasive trunc no it was the -
0	6B	would n't it ?
0	6B	massage certificates , flagpole repair -
1	3I	hm . sure the clothing and pet food section .
1	3I	for like , backpacking ?
2	6B	so definitely sugar-free juice machines .
2	6B	we 're taking that off . and um -
1	6B	i wonder if towing services is something that could be privatized .
0	3I	um , heavy coats . next to socks ?
1	3I	travel guides . yeah , okay .
1	3I	up there , do n't you think ?
0	6B	did we do - ?
2	6B	i suppose the junior soccer league is not gender-specific .
1	6B	that 's true they are yeah .
0	6B	pothole maintenance , subway system -
1	3I	yeah , so - somewhere around there . yeah .
1	3I	yeah . small axes .
1	6B	fishing licenses - i mean i guess we 're - if we 're keeping hunting tags -
1	6B	we did .
1	3I	we did .
1	6B	alright , you wan na read that list for us ?
1	6B	fishing licenses . trunc that 's important . yep .
1	3I	uh , mint toothpaste . probably more like toilet paper .
0	3I	we do n't have any on this aisle here either .
0	6B	education programs -
0	6B	where ?
1	3I	huh clothes .
2	6B	i could go with sugar free juice machines . i 'm not sure about the assistant cooks . because we 're talking about the school lunches , and the thing is that educational programs have so many um , free and reduced lunch programs .
0	6B	um . hospital additions .
1	3I	where 's our - uh - here , maybe ?
1	6B	i do n't know if we need to .
1	3I	which would be with the shoes .
1	6B	let 's let the students be the assistant cooks .
2	6B	so we take out the public access station and put back in - ?
2	6B	mm . we definitely do n't want an unemployed populous so .
1	3I	maybe that 's camping . no ?
0	6B	and the acting coaches .
0	6B	and the acting coaches .
1	6B	so , we the county do n't have to pay for the juice machines .
1	6B	so , is there anything in the one , two , three , four , trunc six - of those six that you would get rid of ?
1	6B	uh . drainage ditches are good for flooding .
1	3I	trunc bundles of sticks . back with the , uh , wood .
1	3I	with large cups and paper bags , maybe ?
0	6B	note taker -
2	3I	so tow ropes , i will put boating supplies , yeah .
2	6B	i - i do n't know . i 've always felt a little weird about that . like -
1	3I	oh now that 's
1	6B	and the police will still be available if there 's an immediate hey so and so this person 's breaking into some person 's house .
1	3I	down here , with the power cords ?
2	6B	cuz that 's not gon na cost money . no , we should just keep it .
2	3I	i 'll just put it here .
1	6B	okay , so i can see -
1	3I	heavy cable . i 'll put that uh -
1	3I	pre-cut wood . maybe next to the saws and axes ?
1	3I	with the , uh -
1	6B	maybe hospital additions ?
1	3I	do you think that we 're allowed - ?
0	3I	and fishing nets .
1	3I	yeah , we 'll - we 'll trunc we 'll keep an extra space on the end , just in case .
0	6B	mm-hmm . massage .
1	3I	it 's fine , i do n't care . well , i can already see heavy cable , so -
0	3I	so i think there 's -
2	6B	it 's horrifying .
1	3I	i feel like , in this one ?
1	3I	large cups . i -
1	3I	where do you think we should put this ?
1	3I	empty plastic jugs and buckets by em maybe .
1	3I	yeah , yeah . yeah , that would work .
1	3I	i - trunc i 'd see - we could have clothes here . and then the rest of the -
0	3I	so , like , trunc juice is -
1	6B	yeah . i 'd say that 's okay .
1	3I	uh , next to the hats ?
2	3I	hm . or maybe next to the scissors ? you think ?
2	6B	yeah , if you wan na do that , you can do that on your own .
1	6B	are we wusses cuz we could only come up with two things in each list ?
0	6B	they used to .
1	6B	and also with , um -
2	3I	yeah , or it could go with the refrigerator magnets and the -
2	6B	yeah , i do n't think that 's -
1	3I	heavy cable , i think that can go -
1	3I	hm . sure .
1	3I	yeah , better .
0	6B	uh , so that 's - that 's two .
1	6B	if it 's like trunc like -
0	6B	i 'm basically just looking at the first column right now .
1	6B	i like soccer more than basketball .
0	6B	they 're more talking about s_t_d_ but -
1	6B	and in my travels i 've - i have definitely seen how evil -
2	6B	no , we need that .
2	6B	so , there 's three in each category except this we had four , so we can add one back in .
0	6B	alright , that 's three things .
1	3I	hm . s-
2	6B	yes . um . housing - yes .
2	3I	that 's where i would look for them , i dunno about you . tweezers .
1	3I	yeah i trunc it 's good .
0	6B	boy 's basketball club
2	3I	i 'll put buckets and empty plastic jugs together .
2	6B	no , and we 're not , but it seems like it does n't -
1	6B	really important .
1	3I	and heavy coats , probably same trunc same deal . travel .
2	6B	yeah ! okay , cool .
0	3I	where did the - ?
2	3I	hm . well if it was one bottle , i 'd say where the refrigerator stuff is , but
0	3I	and you get the last one .
2	3I	packages of cookies , those are all baked goods .
1	3I	trunc trunc yeah , okay . so -
1	3I	four aisles . correct .
0	6B	prenatal check-ups ?
2	3I	mm-hm i would still be inclined to put it here . this is like r_e_i_ to me . they have a lot of backpacks . yeah .
2	6B	the only way - uh , and people with medical marijuana are - were already covered .
1	3I	uh , yeah . let 's do it .
0	3I	and chocolate bars .
0	3I	face cream
1	6B	what do you think is -
1	3I	thank you . mint toothpaste . yeah
0	6B	wood shop up here .
0	6B	the towing , massage -
2	6B	yeah . the - the other one that i think would be easy for me to cut would be the community news - yeah .
0	6B	uh , cooking classes then sugar free juice machines -
1	6B	yeah , that 's what i was thinking of .
1	3I	or , do trunc i do n't know .
0	6B	okay . yeah let 's see what we oh so speed limits . um . additional bus stops .
2	3I	is it - the wine and things usually gets its own section , right ?
1	3I	yeah that 's all the guilty stuff , yeah ? right .
0	6B	know .
1	6B	um we need math tutors , we need the assistant cooks to help .
1	6B	boy 's basketball club . maybe we can -
2	6B	i - i hate cutting education , but let 's see here , um -
1	3I	that would make a lotta sense .
1	3I	i 'll put it across from boating supplies , because -
1	6B	ca n't see why they ca n't be sorta combined .
1	3I	could we -
0	3I	do you have ? uh -
2	3I	with thick sweaters ? that 's where i would look for them .
1	3I	oh . well , that 's a camping thing . that 's for carrying things with you .
0	6B	for trunc maybe it 's in the schools .
2	3I	so , refrigerator magnets , i think that would be a good - uh , egg timers would be good thing to put with that .
1	6B	okay , i dunno . let 's just leave it . mm-kay .
1	3I	and then fish hooks . do you wan na stick em up by our - like , i do n't know - if you go boating you might need a trunc fish hook .
2	6B	well , we did n't have to take it off .
2	3I	i think we did a really good job .
0	6B	mm-kay . so how many have we cut from this one ?
0	3I	cookies .
2	3I	if i was looking for a power cord i might also trunc be looking for duct tape . yep , heavy coats .
2	3I	so , we 'd have to assume that this is paper large cups .
1	6B	i think that 's important . yeah .
0	6B	so , under -
1	6B	the county pays to put the sugar free juice machines in . i think the juice companies -
1	3I	okay , so i put up two because it had two .
2	3I	maybe cake mix .
1	3I	in the - in you garage . yeah . okay .
2	6B	i - i think public - uh , reproductive education , if - when it 's done at the county level -
1	3I	i feel like it should be closer to the end .
1	6B	yeah , trunc yeah .
1	3I	i would put them in , uh , an area with other canned items .
3	3I	doing some good .
2	3I	the liquids and food . cuz we do n't really have any of that over here .
1	3I	abdominal covering clothing .
0	6B	o-
1	6B	that 's right . yeah .
1	3I	pre-cut wood . outdoors -
1	6B	pinch -
0	3I	eat , that are n't - necessarily houseware items .
2	6B	and there 's just two of us ! as compared to -
0	6B	um . reusable bag .
1	3I	bottles of juice might be refrigerated .
1	3I	oh , food .
2	6B	awesome sauce .
0	6B	um , football stadium upkeep .
2	6B	lot 's more people .
0	3I	electric heaters .
0	3I	electric heaters .
0	3I	electric heaters .
0	3I	electric heaters .
0	3I	electric heaters .
0	3I	electric heaters .
0	3I	electric heaters .
0	3I	electric heaters .
0	3I	electric heaters .
0	3I	electric heaters .
0	3I	electric heaters -
0	3I	electric heaters .
1	3I	do you want that with the toilet - toiletry items ? with the tweezers and toilet paper .
2	3I	eh that makes sense to me . cuz - whiskey with smooth vanilla ice cream and it is lovely .
0	6B	in highschool , right ? and this is like planned parenthood .
1	3I	near the - we put the peat moss ?
0	3I	okay , so what 's our next aisle look like ? we got pet food and toys .
1	3I	put it there .
1	6B	well , i know - i know i 'm right . that 's my - that 's part of my career .
2	3I	well , water could go next to juice .
1	3I	no , that might be dairy , as opposed to dry .
2	6B	stray cat spaying i think we have to have ,
1	6B	so then , th-
0	6B	taxis trunc are not listening to the laws to begin with then they 're being - you know - pushed out by uber and all these other folks . so -
1	3I	put that over there put the -
0	6B	the junior soccer league .
0	6B	the junior soccer league -
1	3I	great !
1	3I	great .
1	3I	great .
1	3I	great .
1	3I	chocolate bars . cooking . yeah .
2	6B	i trunc i know that mine really needs a new operating suite but -
2	6B	okay . um , i would cut the juice machines .
1	6B	cut more or add trunc add something back to the other three , and that might be easier than cutting .
0	6B	state .
1	3I	yeah . it could be anyway .
2	3I	we can trunc we can put it in this like , general -
2	6B	because it 's done by faith based groups .
1	3I	dried figs would be with the -
1	6B	have volunteer organizing them more than -
2	6B	the arts . so - so - so trunc there 's two .
1	3I	boating supplies . so let 's do - i 'm gon na - let 's just kinda -
1	3I	well , the - all of these sort of household things , but trunc it does n't really matter . it 's fine .
1	3I	lots of options on this one .
2	6B	job training pays off a lot in the long run , so -
2	3I	wetsuits and boating supplies . it 's going to be underneath those two .
2	6B	it 's something that rots your brain .
1	3I	the siding , outdoors .
1	3I	trunc how bout , yeah , toiletries ?
1	3I	we could put it in the refrigerated stuff .
1	6B	okay , football stadium upkeep .
2	6B	yeah , you have to have that . and you have to have speed limit signs . additional bus stops probably would have to let that go .
2	3I	paper and pet food ?
2	3I	ah , some - boating . up here ?
2	3I	or could be down here .
0	6B	soup kitchens , housing assistance dog catcher , boy -
2	6B	nah .
0	3I	sweet .
0	3I	sweet .
1	3I	i wan na put these -
1	6B	which of these is better than the others ?
2	3I	i think we have a much better store than we started out with .
1	3I	could be near wood .
0	6B	subway trunc
1	6B	you could , yeah . yeah . uh .
0	3I	ah , let 's see .
0	6B	football st-
2	6B	let 's cut note-takers .
1	6B	the veteran 's medical assistance you got ta have .
2	6B	music 's important .
2	3I	yeah ! i like where you stuck it .
1	3I	i - this seems like a total outlier . and flags . i 'm just as general hardware , right ?
0	6B	yes , we did . i think we kept that .
1	6B	so maybe we 're keeping it at the minimum .
0	3I	the question is are they small scissors , like - ?
2	6B	kind of important . yeah . i think we could probably -
1	3I	i would argue that one might be something like camping supplies or something .
2	6B	they 'd do cheaper sports , like frisbee or running .
1	3I	or non-fresh beats .
1	3I	ah , either or .
1	3I	mm . well this is - actually that 's pretty good .
2	3I	do we wan na do - we - we could just put it , like -
0	3I	five-pound weights ? what are those for ?
2	3I	yeah but target or - uh - yeah , but target has , uh , everything .
2	6B	oh , and then the kids would n't buy them if they were n't all sugared up ?
0	6B	veterans medical assistance , egg farms regulations , weed control , pre-'natal checkups , neighborhood watch support .
2	3I	power cords or siding .
2	6B	and they had to specially tow the city bus to the city parking garage so that -
0	6B	special ed teachers .
0	6B	special ed teachers .
1	3I	i do n't know what do you think ?
2	6B	hurt the least in the short term ? i do n't think a lot of people will be hurt if we stop inspecting the bagel factory .
1	3I	yeah , let 's put it kind of down a little -
2	6B	get out !
0	6B	so we have sex ed , custodians , speech therapy -
0	3I	fleece lined book .
1	6B	egg farm regulations is sorta important . everybody eats eggs .
0	6B	i always picture like , is that - is it the fox and the hound , or trunc one of those movies .
1	3I	perfect . bottles of juice .
1	3I	uh , i think book is - i think books is a section right up there . yeah .
0	3I	and a travel guide trunc boating supplies -
1	3I	sounds good . alright . so i 've got some - bundles of sticks . so those are probably good -
1	3I	sad . there , now it has a buddy . hats .
2	3I	um , oh , small axes , nice ! this is interesting , cuz we have these separate - i - i mean , i guess small saws maybe would 've -
2	6B	it would be really - yeah , it would yeah .
2	6B	but we have private -
2	6B	and sex ed is kinda the same thing , but -
0	6B	almost crying when i watched that . and like especially - they had - they had like , the song or something that - and they showed all these little puppies , and they had like a puppy sticking his nose through the crack , and whining , and i just -
0	6B	so we 've - we 're getting rid of the public news station -
2	6B	good heavens , this is n't easy is it ?
2	3I	i bet that this stuff , the cups and the paper bags and the loose leaf could go here . like maybe cups -
2	6B	i mean to me it 's like you just i mean these - the numbers are so - you know - flag pole maintenance is probably what ? twenty thousand and a subway system is eighteen million . so - but - who knows ? it just , that 's trunc totally expensive thing . um .
2	3I	or we coulda put it by the water .
0	3I	large cups .
0	3I	large cups .
0	3I	large cups .
0	3I	large cups .
0	3I	large cups .
0	3I	large cups .
0	3I	large cups .
0	3I	large cups .
0	3I	large cups .
0	3I	large cups .
0	3I	large cups .
0	3I	large cups .
0	3I	large cups !
0	3I	large cups .
1	3I	does that make sense ?
1	3I	where is that ? oh . okay . sure .
1	3I	so then i wonder should with boxes of donuts be -
1	3I	plastic jugs there .
2	3I	no , no , if you put it by the ice cream and the sugar , it makes it easier .
1	6B	instead of the boy 's basketball club ?
1	3I	over here , too ?
2	3I	oh , and we also have to have space for the bathroom supplies . okay , there 's the bathroom there .
1	3I	bundles of sticks , yeah . rolls of duct tape . seems hardware-ish .
2	3I	egg - well , the soybeans .
1	6B	special ed trunc yeah .
0	6B	now - uh , where is that ?
0	3I	beets ! okay .
0	3I	books of matches . pre-cut wood .
1	3I	ah , maybe -
1	3I	or should i start at the bottom , so we can put maybe shoes there ? .
2	6B	because i really do n't care about that football stadium .
1	3I	uh , in-
0	6B	i know . so , sex ed is an trunc custodians .
1	3I	siding , buckets - yeah , tubing .
1	3I	chocolate bars . sounds like the same place to me .
0	3I	half-inch tubing , fishing net . face cream .
2	6B	we do n't need flag pole repair .
1	3I	trunc oh , that 's - small saw . there we go .
1	3I	yeah , and it looks like the third column is just food , everything else is -
1	6B	only that like encompass dogs too .
2	3I	backpacks could be moved , but , you know , that 's probably okay there .
1	6B	yes yeah .
1	3I	we have a trunc well , i dunno .
2	3I	we do n't want it next to all the -
2	6B	they seem - well they seem the same to me . so , it seems like we trunc that invasive species removal and weed control are redundant .
1	6B	that 's actually a good point .
1	3I	we could shop here , trunc rena .
0	3I	let 's see . i 'll draw one out of the middle .
1	3I	we 're not using this at all , so you wan-
1	3I	here . right here .
2	6B	just just by process of elimination .
1	3I	maybe by the cake mix ?
1	6B	three ? okay . um , do you wan na start with education , then ?
1	6B	flagpole repair , towing services -
1	3I	well see , paper bags - they could be like , uh , lunch bags and things so -
0	3I	half-inch tubing .
0	3I	half-inch tubing .
0	3I	half-inch tubing .
0	3I	half-inch tubing .
1	6B	football equipment , maybe -
0	3I	i do n't see any clothing
0	3I	okay , toys -
1	3I	tool section .
1	3I	empty plastic jugs . sure ! we 'll out the water next to that .
1	6B	maybe . no . no . sex ed .
1	3I	um , the foil aisle . where would the foil aisle be in this ?
2	3I	we 're gon na have a lot of clothes . i mean three or four things it seems to me . socks , vests -
1	6B	question mark ?
0	6B	okay stray cat spaying .
0	6B	do you ?
1	3I	yeah , okay .
1	3I	yeah . okay .
1	3I	yeah . okay .
1	6B	yeah , okay .
1	6B	yeah . okay .
1	3I	yeah , okay .
1	6B	yeah . okay .
1	6B	yeah . okay .
1	3I	yeah . okay .
1	3I	yeah . okay .
1	3I	yeah . okay .
1	3I	yeah , okay .
1	6B	yeah . okay .
1	6B	yeah . okay .
1	3I	yeah . okay .
1	6B	yeah , okay .
1	6B	yeah , okay .
1	3I	yeah , okay .
1	3I	yeah ? okay .
2	3I	yeah , we need to fill up some of that space . we only have -
0	3I	for deck chairs .
1	3I	snacks ?
0	6B	what were the things we had questions marks next to ? sugar free juice machines .
2	6B	but i th-
1	6B	than that - that would be -

1	6B	pothole maintenance ? i 'd say yeah .
2	3I	boats .
2	6B	the football players can upkeep the stadium .
2	6B	oh , can that .

0	6B	bail us out !
1	3I	well , that 's a good place . okay .
2	3I	how bout here , though ? cuz then we have all these other kinda kitchen-y items like , what you 'd turn around and see now .
1	6B	i 'd be willing to get rid of neighborhood watch support .
1	6B	it would be a more humane world if they did , yes .
1	3I	over there .
2	6B	could screw bagel factory inspections .
0	3I	you think they 're canned or fresh ?
0	3I	i always end up in that weird , like -
1	3I	alright now , here 's random .
1	6B	uh , and then try to balance it .
1	3I	so adjacent to the peat moss , kinda outdoor and gardening stuff .
2	6B	let 's make only two cuts .
0	3I	an-
2	6B	that goes along with weed control in a way .
1	3I	hm , probably where the buckets and jugs are .
1	3I	the trunc heavy coats and light jackets .
1	3I	you wanted the shoes in the -
1	3I	next to the large cups ?
1	3I	can the go across form the ?
1	6B	um . lem me look - take another look at this . i was - i saw that . i was thinking maybe weed control .
1	3I	here 's travel guides , and toys and mouse traps , and then pet food is in with that .
1	3I	miscellaneous item -
1	3I	seems like the -
1	3I	they 're in our camping thing .
1	3I	buckets . mousetraps .
2	6B	oh , s_t_d_ - no that - we had three , on our list . potentially .
2	6B	but here we do n't need hunting tags so much . so i can see of the hunting tags .
1	3I	agreed .
1	3I	agreed .
1	3I	agreed ?
1	3I	agreed ?
1	3I	agreed ?
1	3I	i mean - this could go near eggs .

0	3I	oop !
0	3I	alright , bundles of sticks .

1	3I	oh , yeah . maybe , like -
1	6B	and somebody from the cooking classes .
1	3I	well , i 'm pretty satisfied with how it looks .
2	3I	oh , just one at a time ! one at a time . they said one at a time .
1	3I	i feel like this is more , like - getting more and more sort of -
1	3I	i dunno . things that you might have in your garage .
1	3I	or is that ?
1	6B	someone takes care of it .
1	3I	yeah . makes sense .
2	3I	that works . it 's - it 's close enough .
2	3I	oh , right next to the sugar .
2	6B	does that - ? is that for people who ca n't write ? i think you have to have em , do n't you ?
1	3I	we 're almost out anyway .
0	6B	in education and programs .
2	6B	and we appeared fair by cutting equally .
1	6B	when we cut something we do n't choose the thing that will make the most people happy . we choose the thing that will make everyone equally unhappy .
1	3I	okay . are we done ?
0	3I	toilet paper and -
2	6B	i would let that good . tattoo artist licenses ? uh , forget that .
2	6B	yeah . the additions probably can -
0	6B	job training programs , chicken pox vaccination , invasive species removal . s_t_d_ , toxic waste disposable disposal .
2	3I	and bundles of sticks should go - when we get to the camping equipment , which we have n't got yet , we 'll put this with that .
1	3I	yeah , kitchen supplies .
1	3I	refrigerated section . right . pretty clearly with the - with the freezer section up there , and the refrigerated down there . alright shall we - ? shall we begin ?
2	6B	we 're not trunc trunc like , how many actors are there gon na be ?
1	6B	okay , um . hospital additions , we 're not expanding at the moment .
1	6B	um , do you wan na start by just picking a number of how many you wan na cut -
0	6B	the what what ?
0	3I	toward the other beverages ?
2	3I	maybe , uh -
2	6B	i 'm a big football fan .
1	3I	jugs and buckets ? are we thinking next to the empty plastic jugs and the buckets ?
0	3I	large cups hm .
1	3I	do wan na do one at a time or multiple at a time ?
1	3I	going up or - so , power cords , heavy cable .
1	3I	kay , where do we want - ? oh , there 's eggs and soybeans .
1	3I	let 's see what we have here .
1	6B	so , sex ed , football equipment -
0	3I	electric heaters . oh -
2	6B	for seattle , i would n't fund more for that .
1	6B	rural area ?
1	3I	mess up our egg section with , uh -
0	6B	they do vaccinations now . mm-hm .
1	3I	how bout right next to the boating supplies ?
0	3I	alright , we got thick sweaters .
1	6B	sugar free juice machines . well , there 's reality and there 's the game we 're playing .
1	6B	we 're leaving in chicken pox vaccination .
0	6B	and there 's a thing that 's killing fir trees also .
1	3I	flags . now that 's different .
1	3I	they c-
0	3I	um , beets . shoot .
2	3I	then the light jackets -
1	3I	um , i do n't know , i 'm trunc i trunc do n't really remember -
1	6B	yeah , i think so too . uh , custodians -
1	3I	or butter , cuz we do n't have milk .
2	6B	i mean that and taxi stops -
1	6B	i 'm - i 'm thinking -
1	6B	or well - unless it 's - unless they need them to do the trunc stray cat spaying .
1	6B	kinda ridiculous or -
1	3I	these are burnable things .
1	3I	i 'm just looking for something that does n't go with anything else .
1	6B	in my opinion we can get rid of football equipment .
2	3I	yeah . those are just weird .
1	6B	and they 're
1	6B	i do n't know . football stadium - football stadium can take care of .
2	3I	i 'm gon na -
2	3I	well , we kinda hafta -
2	6B	thank you . thank you . alright .
2	3I	that was fun .
1	3I	yeah , i would agree with that .
1	3I	are gon na be over by the -
2	6B	yeah , i 'd say that too . so that 'd be five , and then drainage ditches .
0	6B	yeah , it means we 're allowing them to . and if they 're doing it without -
1	3I	oh yes .
1	3I	oh yes .
1	6B	oh yes .
0	6B	cooking classes . i thought you said someone sugar trunc - six .
2	3I	um , large vests . next to heavy coats .
1	3I	do we use the paper bags - ?
1	6B	so we are getting rid of -
0	3I	and now i have two clothing items .
0	3I	was - was n't that the rule ?
1	3I	tweezers should go here , i think .
2	6B	yeah , i feel like the newspaper 's out , so we could maybe cut that one .
0	6B	the cooking classes - and the sugar free juice machines .
1	6B	um . i would think this one .
1	6B	a public access station . i would do the junior soccer league .
2	3I	yeah , i can put it here , and then the front to the store 's here , so they ca n't - they ca n't run out . there we go . alright .
2	3I	why do n't we save it . - and see where we have space . my next one is books , and i think that goes with the travel guides . or the toys , but let 's -
1	3I	oh so some of these things could be with camping but - but they 're also more trunc more -
1	3I	i 'm not sure well , let 's do that .
2	6B	um , i say yeah . yeah .
1	3I	yeah siding or , you know , somewhere over in there . oh here ? power cords -
1	6B	how would you feel about cutting taxi stops ?
1	3I	okay , so that 's gon na be i would think with -
1	3I	trunc trunc but that 's - that 's - you 'd - you 'd expect to find those , like , at a lowe 's , or home depot , right ?
2	3I	we ca n't - we ca n't move that , though . she said do n't move em . yeah . though we hafta put this back , i think , yeah ?
2	6B	but wait a minute ! community news -
0	6B	trunc football equipment .
2	6B	like , school facilities as your neighboring school district , cuz they 're richer . but that - i - that 's how things are .
2	6B	well as long as they 're not funding the busses , it does n't do much good . might be chicken and egg , i do n't know . now , what is a massage certificate ? is that a license to practice massage therapy ? oh , i suppose what 's the greater public good ? fishing licenses , massage certificates , tattoo artist licenses ?
0	3I	cases .
2	3I	do you know what ? i 'm gon na put face cream , tweezers ,
2	6B	so we can cut that .
0	6B	yeah . how bout you ?
1	3I	fishing net . i 'd probably also put over there .
2	3I	yeah this works for me .
2	6B	does the county really need to pay for the junior soccer league ?
2	6B	i think we trunc i think we should cut it .
0	3I	soap .
1	3I	oh , that 'd be good by the toys . yeah .
1	3I	hm . oh , did n't we have - ? yeah by like the face cream .
2	3I	is it outdoor stuff , or is it , like , home kinda stuff ?
0	3I	uh , cushions for deck chairs .
1	3I	thick sweaters , by the large vests .
1	3I	i 'm not gon na - i 'm not trunc i 'm not gon na start a retail store , i know that . heavy -
1	3I	do you - would you put them on the outside or with the - ?
1	6B	uh , most important . or what do you think we can do without ?
1	3I	okay . cool . and then , for boxes of doughnuts , um -
0	3I	i know . big -
1	6B	okay , that 's five . we got that one . now , infrastructure and licensing .
1	3I	yeah . uh -
1	3I	yeah . uh -
2	6B	because you already have cooks , why do you need assistant cooks ? the cooks will just have to work a little harder , i 'm sorry .
0	6B	all the public safety signage not increase the bus stops -
2	6B	no . or transportation .
2	6B	well , no . no , they could like , set up -
2	6B	that 's not done by private companies ?
1	3I	and then gas powered cook stoves ?
2	3I	we do n't - we do n't have any shoes yet , but wherever shoes are is where shoelaces would be .
3	3I	what ? ! who sells that ?
2	3I	we 're getting too many things right here . books .
1	6B	so yeah .
1	3I	the boots and such .
1	3I	mm-kay liters of water .
2	3I	wine in the grocery store .
2	3I	design a store , though .
2	6B	although planned parenthood takes care of a lot of it too . but it 's like school kids . there 's clinics all over .
2	3I	so i would put them somewhere with plenty of space -
2	6B	moving into the future , so let 's cut that one .
2	6B	the one thing i was thinking of is if you got ta choose between trunc additional bus stops or taxi stops . taxis are a - a private thing . yeah .
1	6B	yeah yeah , i think we 've done enough there , then . i do n't want to do too much compromising when it comes to health and safety in general , anyway .
1	3I	uh , let 's see . unless you see another place .
1	6B	yeah . i do n't know what that means , additional bus stops . are we increasing the budget if we keep that ?
1	3I	how bout we put them next to the travel guides ?
1	3I	lets do that .
1	3I	no . we can - yeah , i dunno . we can just put it -
0	3I	see if there 's any other food up here soybeans , sugar .
1	3I	well , kind of a storage thing for filling up -
2	6B	but they could . and then -
1	3I	box knives - yeah .
1	3I	um , i 'll put the saws first unless you care so , small saws above mousetraps , small axes above small saws -
2	3I	oh . also on this one .
0	6B	and acting coaches .
2	3I	and this is interior .
1	3I	maybe with the duct tape and the power cords .
1	3I	home item -
0	6B	uh . we eliminated on the first one -
2	3I	oh , wow .
2	3I	oh maybe it 's there .
1	3I	dried figs ! a , uh bulk -
1	3I	okay . so . should we do the - the big ones first , and make sure - ?
2	6B	or we keep the public - well -
1	3I	light jackets . okay , more clothes .
2	3I	but this is n't .
2	3I	place for fridge - or , uh , kitchen stuff .
2	6B	we 'll remove it . yeah .
1	3I	fleece-lined boots , yeah . yeah .
1	3I	hm i 'm gon na say over here .
1	3I	our hardware section is either gon na be maybe in here , or down here ?
2	3I	or - but trunc i do n't know what 's trunc what we 're gon na put above , but -
1	3I	kay , we got egg timers . this like -
2	3I	either of those seems reasonable .
1	3I	that 's somewhere over there , too .
1	6B	okay , should we just pick a number ?
1	6B	trunc most people just get it when they 're a kid , and then -
0	6B	pest control , football stadium upkeep , boy 's basketball club , and uh -
1	3I	that can go by the canvas bags , don'tcha think ?
1	3I	good job . i think we 're done .
1	3I	okay . by the cake mix ?
0	6B	oh , really ?
2	3I	think that 's it with these . these are all sorta not really stocked very well but -
2	3I	well that could be , like , near here .
1	3I	alright . let 's put it there .
1	3I	toiletry .
1	6B	trunc once we 've got a number -
2	3I	let 's do a different one !
1	3I	now . which can go in here .
1	3I	okay . sticks , i 'll put that with wood i guess .
1	3I	so - and then the egg timers , to me , would be -
2	6B	it 's trunc portant , but i do n't understand why the government 's paying for it .
1	6B	should keep that , yeah .
1	3I	camping and fishing supply section complete .
2	6B	oh , cooking classes ? yeah , cut that . that 's not really necessary . we got the internet . learn on your trunc learn on your own .
2	3I	oh now , see , trunc we 've got eggs and ice cream out here , too .
1	3I	let 's put some order to these .
1	3I	heavy coats . um - i do n't see anything up there . guess - guess we got ta start a new one .
2	3I	trunc stuff to - trunc wearing stuff .
1	3I	which end ?
2	6B	bus stops , keep that .
1	3I	still outside , but - fishing , travel guides -
0	6B	and trunc poetry .
1	3I	should they be by the trunc up above the scissors ?
0	6B	how do you wan na attack this ?
1	6B	i dunno , we already cut the equipment . might as well just cut all of that sport . no . let 's keep that one .
2	6B	well , maybe it 's like - maybe it 's like , um -
1	6B	uh , at least in seattle .
1	3I	mm mm-hm , mm-hm , mm-hm .
1	6B	okay . good call .
2	6B	yeah , it 's a big job . you ca n't just call -
1	3I	i 'm gon na save bundles of sticks -
1	6B	well , we could come back . if we wan na come -
0	6B	yeah , so we started going there for - like , they 'd take us there during the day . um ,
1	3I	and , uh , pre-cut wood . next to liters of water , maybe , for camping ? across from those -
1	6B	we need custodians keeping -
2	6B	cuz that would be extraneous .
1	3I	yeah . i do n't see any gardening supplies here , though .
0	3I	i did n't know they sold bundles of sticks .
1	3I	yes . large vests .
1	6B	and i 'd probably take out cooking classes .
2	3I	i dunno why not .
0	3I	hardware . home improvement .
2	6B	i dunno , i feel like cooking classes is not really super necessary for -
0	6B	yeah , dog catcher . yeah , there it is .
1	3I	it 's just in -
2	6B	yeah . so let 's just keep - let 's get rid of the additional bus stops .
2	6B	trunc yeah i just did n't know why towing services was on the list .
1	3I	yeah , let 's try to - we 'll trunc we 'll , like scope ourselves between the things .
1	3I	as like uh for like fire wood and stuff so .
1	3I	electric heaters , uh - perhaps near the deck chairs and siding ? is there a - a home supply ?
1	6B	oh , that 's true too . okay .
2	6B	okay . yeah . especially if it 's adult education . uh -
1	6B	yeah . toxic waste disposal . very important .
2	3I	backpacks , do you think ? is that , like , outdoor backpacking , or - ?
1	6B	so possibly ?
0	3I	half-inch tubing and gas cookstoves .
1	3I	i do n't have a particular -
1	3I	either near the hardware area down with the rolls of duct tape and power cords -
1	3I	yeah , can we put those up - ?
2	6B	extra coaching , i might say , oh , well -
1	6B	the homeless animal population down .
2	6B	a woman ovulates every twenty eight days , and then -
1	6B	yeah . okay . so we did three . we did three . okay . alright .
1	6B	in japan the kids -
0	6B	could do trunc through three .
1	6B	that 's really specific .
3	6B	yeah , trunc i know , that would mean - i would cry !
2	3I	yeah , that would work . that would work .
2	6B	important . but also for chicken pox - i - if it was just , like , vaccinations in general , i 'd be like , that 's important , but for chicken pox , especially cuz it 's not , like -
0	3I	but - but -
2	3I	socks and shoe laces together .
1	6B	let 's keep the housing assistance .
0	3I	those are things that my son likes to strew all over the house .
2	3I	so , we have , like , this - i do n't know . this is n't quite arts and crafts yet .
0	3I	whatcha got ?
1	3I	yeah . that would - i think that makes sense .
1	3I	yeah . i 'd trunc like yeah .
2	3I	liters of water , that could be emergency supplies . uh -
0	6B	departments ? or new -
2	6B	going . but , at the same time , like , it 's -
0	3I	the soy beans ?
2	6B	kids can go there . if they 'll go there .
2	6B	would be a real last choice -
2	3I	well there were a lot of unrelated things that could n't really be grouped together .
2	6B	football equipment - are they buying football equipment for kids ? cuz we do n't need that .
1	3I	as it 's august , i 'd agree . yeah .
2	6B	yeah . and if they have - if they 're using sub-par equipment that could be a public health risk .
2	6B	unless they had kinda a stage mamma -
2	3I	that 's what i do n't like about - i like trader joe 's a lot , but they do n't have a lot of , like , basic stuff .
2	3I	um . oh , but this is sweets , too . oh , that 's baking though . important distinction .
1	6B	public health and safety . trunc you wan na go to education next ?
2	3I	i do n't think that spot is meant for something this big . uh -
1	3I	right , i 'm content now at this -
0	3I	so we have four -
1	3I	excursion item , so i would suggest somewhere near -
2	6B	that 's one i was thinking about .
1	6B	i know . it 's - that 's fine .
2	6B	i think special education teachers are very important .
1	6B	yeah . vet - vet hospital , i think is important .
1	3I	that - yeah .
1	3I	and good job ! that 's our last item .
0	6B	bugs or mice .
0	6B	one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fourteen - okay , i 've got seven region alright .
1	3I	but i think it would 've gone over with clothes , or -
1	3I	yeah . liters of water , so should go , like , next to the chocolate bars , and -
1	6B	yeah , the juice machines . and maybe also the acting coaches . so maybe those two things ?
2	3I	let 's go ahead and put that underneath the electric heaters .
0	6B	how does - ? uh -
2	6B	got ta keep the acting .
0	6B	and special ed teachers .
2	6B	maybe that 's our thinking . maybe that 's our thinking .
2	3I	problem is we do n't now what else is in the box .
1	3I	it 's not - it 's a domestic item . toilet paper .
1	6B	yeah , let 's cut that .
1	6B	so we could cut that ?
2	3I	oh man !
0	6B	what were the other two that we already decided on ?
2	3I	i guess you 're gon na have to put it under shoelaces .
2	6B	so i would say we 're removing -
0	6B	maybe it 's -
2	6B	abandoned animals .
2	3I	why ?
2	6B	why ?
1	3I	alright , both heavy winter wear .
1	3I	cold stuff .
1	3I	um , cans of peas . soybeans .
1	3I	i do n't know . what do you think ?
1	6B	could be important .
0	3I	on our list i think it was there . or , one list or the other .
2	3I	which - those are vegetables - produce . so i 'm gon na put them with the soy beans . so right underneath the - soybeans .
1	6B	okay . and then , just to talk about the last three . fishing licenses , again , we wan na regulate it .
0	6B	acting coaches , poetry books .
0	6B	acting coaches , poetry books .
1	6B	and i do n't believe they still - trunc trunc trunc roosevelt used to have cooking and sewing , even - well - even when michael was -
0	6B	massage certificates . i wonder what that means , certificates .
1	6B	uh , how to you trunc t do you think is most important to keep ?
1	6B	books are important .
1	3I	yeah . uh , we could also put it with the power cords . yeah .
1	6B	portant ?
1	3I	there we go . yeah .
1	3I	what if we put it next to mousetraps ?
2	6B	yeah , i wonder - yeah , we could probably maybe -
1	6B	right , or they call them .
2	3I	um - oh ! good . so , we have -
0	3I	tow ropes .
0	3I	tow ropes .
0	3I	tow ropes .
0	3I	tow ropes .
0	3I	tow ropes .
0	3I	tow ropes .
0	3I	tow ropes .
0	3I	tow ropes .
0	3I	tow ropes .
2	6B	if we keep invasive species removal - we keep that , we can get rid of weed control .
1	6B	i 'm content .
1	6B	yeah . oh , boy .
2	6B	yeah . and we have n't really talked about em but taxi stops just do n't seem like they would make a whole lot of - sense . you know -
1	3I	mm , food ?
1	6B	okay , now the hunting - hunting tags .
1	3I	first one how bout - ?
1	3I	boating and siding and power cords . that 's hardware .
1	3I	what do you say ? here ? or - ?
2	6B	hopefully you have newspapers and - and local media that are covering a lot of those things .
1	6B	should we ?
1	6B	the list that i figure is the least important is the one i wan na get the number from .
1	3I	or above the toilet paper , somewhere up here ?
1	3I	the travel guides , or -
2	3I	fishing net we 're gon na put up here .
0	6B	hospital additions , bagel factory inspections , needle exchange , sex offender database -
1	6B	i dunno . i trunc well , like trunc i - there 's this one guy i know who did note taking for a blind guy and then he would type them all up . and then the blind guy had a computer system that read them for him .
1	3I	food aisle , probably .
0	3I	they have thrown some things in here that were not on our list .
2	6B	you trunc trunc well , a state law . yeah . i - i do n't - trunc i do n't think there 's a federal law , but there is a state law .
1	6B	alright , okay .
1	6B	i - i think that could go .
2	6B	which is recreation and public services .
2	6B	wash out my ziploc bags and all that . if there 's something we have to cut
2	3I	there , there 's a food item . i would put that with the food items .
1	3I	yeah . over there .
1	6B	the acting coach .
1	3I	either near the large cups or near the baking supplies depending on whether we want to -
0	3I	well , okay -
0	6B	teaching certificates , speed limit signs , additional bus stops -
1	6B	but we do n't have to pay to organize the leagues .
0	3I	right . okay .
2	6B	yeah , cuz - safety . drainage . all these are like -
1	6B	then we 're good .
1	6B	that 's like humane society .
1	3I	yeah , i think we need to .
1	3I	paper bags . kind of -
1	3I	empty plastic jugs , that 's kinda camping .
0	6B	let 's see , let 's see .
1	3I	oh , that 's probably true should we put it under ?
1	6B	the food bank we definitely have to have .
1	6B	yeah . football stadium upkeep .
1	6B	let 's keep it . keep the last three .
0	6B	if not five .
1	6B	yes , we definitely do .
2	6B	oh . we might be - we might be increasing the stops . so , let 's keep that .
0	3I	borscht .
1	3I	are we pleased with our - ?
1	6B	cut -
1	6B	cut -
1	6B	uh , taxi stops . right , okay . sounds good .
1	3I	one of those aisles ?
1	3I	loose leaf paper . it 's uh - maybe with the toilet paper .
0	6B	oh , did we ?
1	3I	i do n't know . that 's - that 's how i read the rules , anyway .
1	6B	it 's probably not as important , as far as , like , uh -
1	6B	kitten puppy adoption i think we have to have . soup kitchens we have to have . housing assistance we have to have . dog catcher we have to have .
1	3I	more -
2	6B	i do n't know , like a high school , like , practice field , that -
1	3I	sure , and then buckets .
1	3I	sure . sounds good . they 're both liquids that - that - that counts .
1	3I	heavy coats . i 'd put that - yeah , with the other clothing .
2	6B	yes . yes . that 's the trunc th-
2	6B	i think we have enough speed limit signs .
2	6B	we ca n't take out -
1	3I	so let 's do our - let 's place our boating supplies type things first .
1	3I	what , over here ?
1	3I	that 's like a -
0	3I	beets -0
1	3I	sure , miscellaneous .
1	3I	bagel across from donuts ?
1	6B	that was n't too bad .
2	6B	i think that weed control can go .
1	3I	maybe seasonal things ?
2	6B	i guess so .
2	6B	i guess so .
1	3I	tubing . yeah . right . yeah .
2	6B	maybe that 's actually important .
1	3I	okay . i 'll put it up above the gas powered stove .
1	6B	yeah , i do n't either .
0	6B	however , many people are usually making a decision , yeah .
2	3I	uh , we have soybeans , trunc maybe here ? oh , oh i see , so we have cake mix over here .
0	3I	well this does n't say canned .
0	6B	did you know that the trunc washington state government gives twice as much money to boeing as it does to the university of washington ?
2	6B	oh yeah . 
1	3I	maybe outdoor things . maybe adjacent to the boating supplies , possibly ?
1	6B	yeah , i 'm not a big football person either .
1	6B	well , we can get rid of it .
2	6B	okay , infrastructure and licensing . teaching certificates , seems important . speed limit signs are very important , i guess . additional bus stops .
2	6B	county though , when you have - ?
1	3I	i -goes here .
1	3I	yeah , maybe we wan na analyze for a sec , yeah . i guess i noticed that -
1	3I	yeah , i think in there , probably .
1	3I	sure yeah , trunc right there . that sounds good .
1	6B	are you okay with those four ?
1	3I	okay , i think we got it .
1	3I	and chocolate .
2	3I	but trunc trunc whiskey 's usually , like , on the end of the aisle do we wan na , like , put it at the end ?
2	3I	eggs are sorta down there by themself . that makes sense because trunc refrigerated .
2	3I	or fishing . and then we still have our fishing stuff .
1	3I	i guess ? yeah .
1	6B	i guess , yeah .
2	6B	yeah . you got ta -
0	3I	okay . five pound weights .
2	6B	i can trade away the hunting tags in order to have more drainage ditches i 'm just thinking of the real nuts and bolts , keeping the city working stuff .
2	3I	okay . trunc we 're - we 're - we have a - yeah . heavy cable . again , now . we 're sort of heavy on the hardware .
0	3I	cool . thick sweaters .
1	6B	speech therapy , w-
2	6B	flag pole repair is one that 's easy .
2	6B	tattoo artist licenses ? that seems like , really specific for adult education .
1	3I	not really , okay , so -
0	3I	let 's see , we 've got bars of soap mint toothpaste , face cream , and tweezers .
0	6B	acting coaches , weed control , and public access station okay , infrastructure and licensing .
0	6B	alright , stray cat spaying .
2	6B	subway system , we need our public transportation . hunting tags , that could probably -
1	3I	i like that . small saws . this - all in the first -
1	3I	in here ?
1	3I	in here .
1	3I	in here ?
2	6B	i think it 's because we do n't really know what community news ads are , or the public access station -
1	3I	yeah , maybe down here ?
2	3I	i kind of think it goes with , like , refrigerator magnets and stuff kay .
2	3I	cuz maybe it 's , like camping-y -
0	6B	what are taxi stops ?
1	6B	so we 're agreed on the poetry books and the cooking classes ?
2	6B	bitch and moan , and that 's too bad for them , but -
1	3I	it could go next to the bottles of juice . that 's not a bad idea .
1	6B	the one that you would -
0	6B	uh , what was the other one that we said ?
2	3I	so in a real grocery store , where would the dried figs be ? i do n't know . um -
1	3I	and trunc actually we could put heavy cable with -
1	6B	can them .
2	6B	these are all important things cept for football equipment .
1	3I	and then liters of water ? maybe by the whiskey ?
1	6B	okay . makes sense .
1	6B	sames
1	3I	that 's , like , camping .
1	3I	or should those go in the back ?
0	6B	certificate - certificate means you have to -
1	6B	mm-hm . right .
1	3I	another .
2	3I	certainly depends on what type of flag they are .
1	6B	they could go together .
2	6B	i think it 's important too . cooking classes , i - people do n't know how to cook . i think they 're kind of important . yeah , i mean , i could see , like - i do n't know , you do n't need to offer ten cooking classes , but i think it 's important to at least have a couple .
2	3I	alright . i have some box knives which go really well with the power cords . i 'm gon na put them right above those power cords .
1	6B	um . sorry larry .
1	6B	to me the easiest one to look at is recreation and public services
2	6B	immediate -
2	3I	dairy . right down -
2	6B	yeah . i mean or else the - the pounds are gon na -
1	6B	on a volunteer basis .
1	6B	infrastructure and licensing . teaching certificates needs to stay .
1	3I	that 's a weird thing .
1	3I	these are all -
2	3I	trunc if we put it above it has more space .
1	3I	travel guides , mouse trunc kinda here ? or ?
0	3I	and then , we 've got four left .
0	3I	cable -
0	3I	cable .
2	6B	but then what 's the point of having a government ? if you just cut every service ?
1	6B	weed control can go . do n't you think ?
1	3I	that 's a good way to do it .
2	3I	and the fishing net goes with fish hooks and boating supplies .
2	6B	i think the public could definitely handle stray cat spraying - spaying -
2	6B	say yeah , so there 's three . um , definitely housing assistance ? okay , yeah . that 's a good one . dog catcher ?
0	6B	oh . did n't know about that one .
1	6B	yeah . i think that 's our five .
0	6B	it 's like - er -
0	6B	do we have a subway system ?
2	6B	having a non-corrupt way of having that car removed .
2	3I	so if we 're doing this , i think we should -
0	6B	what is it ? the -
1	3I	okay , so i 'll put the - trunc let ' trunc yeah , why do n't i put the sock right on th-
1	3I	breakfast items ?
2	3I	duh . kay . cookies , can go with -
1	6B	well they have -
1	3I	they do n't have to be refrigerated .
0	6B	that 's four .
0	6B	that 's four .
1	3I	yeah . they 're close .
2	3I	i do n't mind . just - trunc i thought - how bout if we put em over here ? and kinda -
0	3I	uh , books of trunc excuse me , books of matches .
1	3I	maybe could go on this side with the mousetraps ?
2	6B	i have a friend who 's a massage - she 's a licensed therapist .
1	6B	out at the airport ?
2	3I	yeah , or the fridge magnets , or -
1	3I	it 's kind of a weird category .
1	3I	would you rather put this one down by -
1	6B	yeah , i do n't think that 's as trunc okay . so , do neighborhood , weed and hospital additions .
1	3I	it 's not up there yet . fleece lined boots . how about with the - ?
1	6B	and i can see getting rid of the massage certificates , and then -
2	3I	yeah . i 'm gon na put em right underneath the boating supplies .
2	3I	mm , or we could have it -
1	3I	next to the juice .
1	6B	it is , yeah . it 's under my professional services .
1	6B	well , how bout we get rid of reusable bag campaign ?
1	6B	we can be generous and not - you know cut three or four things .
1	3I	does it matter to you ?
1	3I	should probably be saying these too .
2	6B	well , trunc
2	3I	alright . got a fishing net . that 'll go great with the fish hook and wet suits and boating supplies
2	3I	hats hats and light jackets should definitely go together .
2	3I	which would - i mean - this trunc i often find chocolate near baking in stores or some reason .
1	6B	without any -
3	3I	who sells - yeah . what kinda store has this ?
3	6B	that can be cut ! screw that ! cuz - cuz if we 're not cutting subway system or bus , then we can cut taxi .
2	6B	trunc trunc uh , why - do we - ?
1	3I	well , it should probably be like in here , i guess .
0	3I	wetsuits . mm-hm .
1	6B	you know - i dunno .
2	6B	well , that 's what - it depends on the definition of towing services . if the definition of towing services is , let 's say there 's a car accident and someone needs to tow the car out of the road -
1	3I	canned , but -
2	3I	do n't know . this was gon na be our building stuff .
1	3I	i 'm gon na call that a boating supply rather than a clothing .
1	3I	small saws . yeah .
1	3I	i think it 's usually trunc by trunc pet food .
2	3I	definitely on the outdoors -
1	3I	oh . there 's wetsuits . we could probably put next to boating supplies or cushions .
1	6B	what 's the county doing in that ?
1	3I	trunc egg timers . okay .
2	3I	this is good as we can do .
2	3I	trunc were we gon na keep sharps here ? even though this is kind of a - i mean , it could totally work with wood and outdoor stuff , too .
1	3I	we can do it by .
1	3I	okay . i 'm not sure where the can of peas is gon na go yet .
1	3I	we 'll leave space to put more .
1	3I	liters of water . how bout that ? would that go near the plastic jugs ? or do you think it would go -
0	6B	gorst and stuff got all this and just cl-
0	6B	oh , those are -
1	3I	trunc the clothes section .
1	3I	yeah , it 's true .
1	3I	so , that 's like um hardware i think .
2	6B	that was hard .
2	3I	hardware ? we 're running out of hardware space . think we have one more .
0	3I	books of matches . hm .
0	6B	towing services , massage certificates , taxi stops ?
1	6B	huh , that would make sense , would n't it ?
1	3I	cutting objects .
1	3I	see - um - i think -
1	6B	and - and - each - each -
0	3I	did - did they put that there or did we ? okay .
2	3I	and the i could put it right next to the ice cream .
0	3I	um , duct tape .
1	6B	we 'll think about it .
0	3I	we have shoe laces .
2	6B	that 's not education though .
1	3I	i 'm picturing the store where i trunc the fred meyer nearest my house .
1	6B	yeah . six from each one .
0	6B	sugar free juice , and poetry .
2	6B	true . true .
2	6B	s_t_d_ education 's pretty important . toxic waste is important . hospital additions . tsk .
2	6B	and people can still get taxis at the - yeah . and they get - trunc they get taxis in the most important areas anyway . just , like , they would argue , well , we still have the most important bus stops . it 's , like , yeah , but , they have more people taking buses .
1	3I	and kind of miscellane-
2	6B	invasive species removal department .
0	6B	pest control .
0	6B	pest control -
0	6B	pest control .
1	3I	the trunc i mean , the figs and the beans and the peas , that 's -
0	3I	you have a two year old who likes beets ?
1	3I	mmmm cake mix , sugar -
0	6B	um custodians .
1	6B	sex ed is - is very important , i believe .
1	3I	backpacks . school supplies .
2	3I	definitely wetsuits i 'd put close to the boating supplies .
1	3I	that a bit better ?
1	3I	face cream . yeah , yeah , yeah yeah .
1	3I	so maybe in the middle of the aisle between the five pound weights and the heavy cable ?
1	6B	i think it just goes back to those other categories . it can be under both .
2	6B	i think we should get rid of taxi stops . um . because - no .
1	3I	with this one or with your two ?
1	3I	next to mousetraps ?
1	6B	so how bout we cut five from each of these ?
2	3I	i wish pet food was n't there . i wish we could move that -
2	6B	and i think if any of the teachers have to go , unfortunately for me , personally , it would be the acting coach -
1	3I	okay , with the liters of water and the plastic jugs . fish hooks , of course , would go with -
2	6B	yeah , that 's true . it 's hard to know if we 're implementing these , or if we 're just -
1	3I	well small axes and mousetraps both kill things . how 's this ? is that good ?
1	3I	but that 's okay .
1	3I	well , mint toothpaste , that seems pretty -
2	3I	if we 're continuing in that sorta camping theme - i 'm gon na put them above the bundles of sticks .
2	6B	okay . we 'll leave reproductive .
1	6B	going out , yeah . towing services .
2	3I	box knives . i 'd put them more with like - small trunc small tools like -
1	6B	okay , so probably not with that one .
1	3I	uh , liters of water , probably down there where the juice was .
0	3I	grab some more stuff off the truck .
2	6B	if they wan na have ads they can do it themselves . we 're not gon na pay for it , i guess . and .
2	3I	let 's go from toys to outerwear .
0	3I	was there anything um -
0	6B	as in like learning how to - ?
2	6B	infrastructure and trunc and licensing . teaching certificates we need . speed limit signs , we need . additional bus stops , we do n't necessarily need .
2	6B	i do n't feel like it 's that great of an idea .
1	3I	oh , canvas bags could be used for shopping . they could be used for camping .
2	3I	tweezers ! something for the bathroom . maybe with the toothpaste ?
2	6B	someone has to have a way of -
0	3I	all i c-
1	6B	area .
1	6B	yeah . i think that would be important . custodians , you -
1	3I	and bars of soap . makes me think of the bathroom .
1	3I	um . maybe books and scissors could go near -
1	6B	that is more about how he voted , and what he 's doing for you .
1	3I	okay . keep liquids with liquids .
0	6B	uh-oh , did i just step on something ?
1	3I	maybe - maybe here ?
1	3I	bottles of juice would be -
0	6B	um - oh , and the hospital additions !
1	3I	more bundles of sticks . how bout down here ?
0	6B	so that means we would be cutting dog catcher , boy 's basketball club , football stadium upkeep , and the public access station .
2	6B	oh , i like the idea , but that is something that could be cut .
1	3I	yep ! that 's what i 'd do .
0	6B	like , p_b_s -
2	6B	in the northwest ? that 's crazy . oh , it made me sad .
2	6B	and i think that 's what it means about this , too . the tattoo artists . it means like the government keeps track of who trunc whose doing tattoos and how they 're doing it .
1	6B	i mean it 's important but hopefully people are -
1	6B	you know , disadvantaged youth and neighborhood programs .
1	3I	alright . so i 've got flags next . so where do we wan na put some patriotic stuff ?
1	3I	well it 's gon na be modeled off the albertson 's now , then . large cups ?
1	3I	yeah ! that makes sense . lunch trunc lunch .
0	6B	have to cut the same number of items from each column
0	3I	coats . yeah .
0	3I	right in there okay .
1	3I	i do n't remember anything else like this . do you ?
0	6B	um . neighborhood watch support .
2	6B	and if it brings in money to the town , then it - maybe it 's - maybe it 's good to have a football stadium .
1	6B	but if we continue to - if we do the public bus upkeep -
2	3I	sticks of butter . oh , food , food , food .
1	3I	oatmeal . where would you put that ?
2	6B	yeah , probably not .
1	6B	so i 'd rather have more bus stops than more taxi stops .
2	3I	flags . flags are kinda camping - deck chair kinda stuff . how does that sound ?
2	3I	i think it would - yeah , you 're right , it would go here , would n't it ? it would go with the trunc the small toiletries .
1	6B	yeah , unless , like , we 're trying to preserve the arts . um -
1	6B	pretty soon they 're gon na pay for themselves .
1	3I	sure , yeah . makes sense .
2	3I	small axes . this all seems like this .
1	6B	there 's going to be a lot of it if we cut stray cat spaying .
2	6B	it 's sorta like if people already have -
1	6B	yell on the corner . right .
1	3I	trunc no ?
1	3I	i wonder if we have enough space to have a trunc clothing section here or something ?
1	6B	that 's probably kind of important . i mean .
1	3I	this is a type of rope , and we do have long ropey type things .
2	6B	like two , maybe .
0	3I	um , half-inch tubing .
1	3I	mm . that look ? drinks .
3	6B	oh my god ! i ca n't have that happen on my watch .
1	3I	uh it 's fishing , cleaning the fish .
1	3I	okay . should we put the boots down already ?
2	3I	okay . okay . and so then we 've got all of these - well , the large vests coulda gone with fishing stuff , but oh well .
1	6B	can we cut that ?
3	6B	that 's crazy .
1	3I	boxes of doughnuts . i would say probably -
1	3I	how bout refrigerator magnets ?
1	3I	at both .
2	6B	you ca n't have - trunc , like , bedbugs . yeah , or - ew ech !
2	6B	trunc people who have pets pay - like , when i - i - when my dog needs help , i have to trunc i trunc take him to a hospital , but it 's not a -
2	6B	to me there 's a lot of things that can be done by the non-profit community .
1	3I	some toiletries or something .
1	3I	yeah , that 's - that 's kind of miscellaneous again i -
1	3I	um - in here .
2	6B	sorry , people . tattoo , uh - okay i think tattoo is like -
2	6B	um , i would say get rid of the towing services .
0	3I	eyebrow scissors ?
1	6B	oh ! if we only get rid of three things , okay .
2	3I	fruits and vegetables . that 's where it is in trader joe 's . the figs .
2	3I	toilet paper . i would say that sounds good . rolls of duct tape . do you think that 's , like , outdoor , or inside ?
2	6B	well - hm .
1	3I	yeah . at least they have all the food stuffs in one .
0	3I	alright , heather .
2	6B	that was willing - you know , the bank president said our board , they 're - they 're willing to be the bank , and then they reneged about a week later . they said no , we ca n't do it because of the trunc controlled substance for the federal - we would lose our license , an-
0	3I	kay , chocolate bars .
1	3I	yeah . that 's okay . mm-hm .
1	6B	that need to go . if we want to keep it even .
2	6B	then the veteran group would come out of the woodwork and say how can you desecrate the american flag ? and -
1	6B	hunting tags is state .
0	6B	oh , she turned off the light .
2	6B	i 've got hay fever that 's asthma - that creates asthma , so i 'm - i 'm happy about weed control .
1	3I	um , so i 'll put it up on - i 'd put it up on top .
2	6B	you also have dog catcher on there .
0	3I	let me grab a few more .
2	3I	it does n't really make sense .
1	3I	toothpaste and soap together ?
0	3I	fleece .
2	3I	and thick sweaters .
1	3I	layout of our store .
1	3I	should go -
1	3I	or like somewhere in its own section .
0	3I	utility scissors .
1	6B	it 's trunc is that one of the more expensive things ?
1	3I	you want it to be , like , there ?
0	6B	fishing license .
2	6B	now , i 'm - i 'm glad that you and i agreed on that trunc s_t_d_ education and reproductive education . the way those are worded , it makes it harder to make the choice .
1	6B	yes . we 'll keep public bus upkeep .
1	3I	okay , we can hope maybe we get some trunc uh -
1	6B	it depends , yeah .
0	6B	which of those things can people do without the county funding them ? i guess .
0	3I	well there 's siding , eggs , ice cream water .
2	6B	why would you need an education program for that ?
1	3I	next to the books , maybe ?
2	6B	okay . that 's three . yeah , i 'd agree with that one .
0	3I	you 're welcome .
2	6B	i mean it sound - there 's this theme here - i mean of - i mean you 've got stray cat spaying , kitten and puppy adoption , dog catcher , and veterinary hospital . and it 's like whoa are they having a serious issue with - or they just want to like -
0	6B	county . that 's a whole county .
1	3I	now we have a - a stack of heavy winter wear .
0	3I	books , scissors . i have socks .
0	3I	and your soybeans .
1	3I	uh , maybe around -
1	6B	forget that .
0	6B	like new football equipment ?
1	6B	and then people can be connected with the police or whatever .
1	3I	how bout - oh , we ca n't move them once we put them on there .
0	3I	oh , no no , trunc i think that 's just , like the smallest - like trunc like the - yeah , yeah yeah , exactly .
2	3I	tow ropes oh , that 'd be good near the boating supplies but i do n't know if we have - do n't know if that counts , it 'll kinda hang off the top of the aisle .
2	3I	household , so - household stuff is - where 's , uh - ?
0	6B	uh , special ed teachers ?
0	6B	uh , special ed teachers .
1	3I	sandwiches for breakfast with them .
2	6B	neighborhood watch support can go . now we got ta find one more . one more , we got ta go .
1	3I	i think books can be next to -
1	6B	maybe , i dunno .
1	6B	maybe . i dunno .
0	3I	wonder where it came from .
1	6B	they probably -
2	6B	sure ! let 's do - let 's do that .
1	3I	i 'm gon na save clothes until the end , gon na figure out where the - cushions for deck chairs .
2	6B	okay let 's just keep it . hunting tags . that goes along with other licensing things .
2	6B	oh , football equipment . yeah , you can tell we 're women . okay . so now , we -
1	6B	note-takers ? yes .
1	3I	in the refrigerated unit ?
2	3I	cuz we 're - remember we also have shoes -
1	3I	that - okay .
1	3I	toiletry tools like how bout next to toothpaste ?
2	3I	let 's put our temptations -
1	6B	also important .
1	6B	acting coaches . similarly , the arts , probably kind of important .
1	3I	we 're having refrigerated juice .
1	3I	let 's put them next to the small axes .
1	3I	egg timers . kitchen .
1	6B	well , i suppose the one -
1	3I	but there 's also mousetraps , which is sort of disposable indoor household miscellany .
2	6B	yeah additional bus stops for sure . yeah . that 's good . yeah . we did it , we did it !
2	6B	have to maybe try to find volunteers to do that . kitten and puppy adoption . probably that would n't be . yeah . soup kitchens , yes .
0	3I	we 've got -
1	3I	hm . house supply kind of thing .
1	3I	maybe we can put it down here , for -
1	6B	well i think if you cut those thing , people are just gon na do it without .
1	3I	ice cream , eggs - so those are kinda refrigerated , are n't they ?
2	6B	trunc well , trunc those three went to one .
0	3I	i think so , yep .
1	3I	and fishing net .
1	3I	do that .
1	3I	refrigerated -
1	3I	refrigerated ?
0	6B	so , let 's see , assistant cooks , sex ed , -
1	3I	yeah , let 's see . um -
1	3I	you need sugar to mix drinks sometimes . tow ropes ? how about next to the other cables ?
0	6B	hunting tags , towing services , massage certificates , taxi stops -
1	3I	maybe with the hardware things , cuz i - cuz electric , you would n't take that camping , i do n't think . okay .
1	3I	yeah , but what would you do with a bundle trunc stick ?
0	6B	maybe they 're actually teaching you how -
2	6B	well , almost .
0	6B	any of those electric - and you do n't -
1	3I	yeah , .
2	6B	we can deal with dirty bagels .
1	6B	list .
2	3I	no . well , five-pound weights would be , like , also in fishing . do n't they use that for , uh -
2	3I	i do n't think we 're very good at organizing stores based on one item at a time , but that 's okay .
0	6B	okay . heather . we 're done .
2	6B	i 'd - i trunc oh , i had a terrible time with that when i was a watch captain . but we have a good one in our neighborhood . but that 's - trunc i mean , that 's - i do n't know how many other neighborhoods do .
0	6B	how much veteran 's - how many - ch - medical assistance does the county put in to veterans ? or is that a federal thing ? yeah .
0	6B	have you ever had it ? or - i 've never had it i probably -
1	3I	okay , we 'll put it under egg timers - oh -
0	3I	heavy -
2	6B	yes . i agree . okay , so we cut four . so , let 's cut four from everything else .
1	3I	yeah , i 'd put it by boating supplies . yeah .
1	6B	okay . just to make a trunc tatement .
2	6B	see , i 'm not a big football fan . i 'd probably get rid of the football stadium upkeep .
0	6B	pothole maintenance , subway system , hunting tags -
1	6B	well and i guess if i were looking at this i 'd look at hospital additions .
2	6B	i saw a few in boston once , or like in summerville , which is just outside boston , but i guess its not really , like , that essential . i 'm sure that the city will , you know , move on , like without trunc the taxi stops cuz the trunc the parking spaces that open up could generate more revenue .
1	3I	uh , would you put that trunc with the stuff .
2	3I	i think if we end up with all the hats and sweaters and -
1	6B	that 's probably eeh .
0	6B	food bank
1	3I	next to the power chords i guess .
2	6B	stuff , um - sugar free juice machines , i still uh , i question the essential ness of that one . um -
1	6B	so do we need to go back and do any more ? okay . i think we 're done , heather . yeah .
1	6B	i think - i go with those , too .
1	3I	kay , cookies ! next to the chocolate bars .
1	3I	okay . alright . alright . there we go .
2	6B	in trunc in relation to the other things , it can probably be cut .
1	3I	okay , maybe above soybeans ?
0	6B	give away ?
1	3I	and our tow rope . last one . boating supplies .
1	3I	yeah . maybe by - yeah , by travel guides ?
1	3I	so , i do n't know . go up there , or - ?
1	6B	that would mean four - four items would have to be cut from each -
1	6B	yeah . and , i dunno . junior soccer league . i dunno if we need that .
1	3I	boats . scissors .
1	6B	how bout , uh , assistant cooks ?
1	3I	large vests is clothes , right ?
0	3I	and the wetsuits .
1	3I	alright , we 're getting close ! we 're getting close .
1	6B	kind of look through each list first and get a sense of how many -
1	3I	or i guess it could go with the outdoor stuff .
1	6B	yes . um -
2	3I	actually , water a lot of times is where the -
2	6B	i trunc you have pre-natal checkups , but the time you 're an adult you do n't really need to know -
1	6B	yeah , trunc they do .
2	6B	i do n't know . mm .
1	6B	is that in there ? oh i did n't see that , yeah . trunc well , and acting coaches , i mean -
1	3I	we 're running outta - put it up here ? or is it -
1	3I	just in case . alright , sounds good to me .
1	6B	yeah , i 'd probably axe the towing services .
1	3I	that 'll work .
1	3I	i think that 's - i trunc i would put it over in the first or second column .
2	3I	we do n't want it next to here , cuz we do n't want people doing a whole buncha - yeah .
2	6B	okay , so there 's one , and reproductive education we 're keeping . let 's see , which one did we decide - ? so , if we 're cutting s_t_d_ education -
1	6B	i think so , but cats ? i do n't mind having cats run around on the streets . they 're fun .
2	6B	the county , uh , has stations . so you can take all of your old paint and stuff -
0	3I	where did we have - ?
1	3I	should i go between boating supplies and siding ?
1	3I	would you put it by trunc refrigerator magnets ? yeah .
2	6B	if it 's about being pretty , rather than , like , destroying the - the area .
2	6B	teaching certificate . i think you freaking need those .
1	6B	yeah , i would say if i had to axe on of these it would probably be that .
0	6B	uh , kitten and puppy adoptions .
1	3I	maybe lean towards , like , the middle of the aisle . okay .
1	6B	right , so maybe if we cut both that - cooking classes and the juice machines .
2	6B	they can go to a different city and get their tattoo done .
0	3I	um , gas-powered cookstoves .
2	6B	i think that 's probably too . and i 'm thinking taxi stops . do we need taxi stops ? does the county need to provide those ?
0	3I	let 's see .
0	3I	let 's see .
0	6B	let 's see .
0	6B	let 's see .
0	6B	let 's see .
0	6B	let 's see -
0	6B	let 's see .
0	3I	let 's see -
0	3I	let 's see .
0	6B	let 's see .
0	3I	let 's see .
1	3I	okay . i 'm gon na put it right here .
2	6B	cuz there 's a strong social component to that , and it 's something a community can easily rally around .
0	6B	well this is , this is where if you take a computer to comp u_s_a_ or something like that and pay them a fee -
1	3I	no , i dunno . i dunno .
0	6B	bookkeeping classes , and music teachers .
1	6B	i thought we had three . bookkeeping , sugar free -
1	3I	that 's more kind of camping -
1	3I	if that 's what - is that what you 're thinking when you think paper bags ?
2	6B	especially on your side of the mountains .
0	6B	so - um .
1	3I	so if you - why do n't you just , like , pull one out and then we can talk about it .
2	6B	my book , we can !
2	6B	i 'm trunc i 'm ready to immediately hit -
2	6B	that might be borderline .
2	3I	it seems like the empty plastic jugs could 've been with large cups , maybe . i do n't know .
1	3I	there 's rooms there .
1	6B	i completely agree .
1	3I	i think that 's in this row .
1	6B	the - yeah , that would be -
1	3I	i think either 's fine .
1	3I	oh , that 's true .
1	6B	oh , that 's true .
2	6B	we can cut the whole subway system -
1	6B	pardon me . juice .
0	6B	a trunc a road ? a curb ?
0	6B	adoption -
0	3I	buckets and cups .
1	6B	probably keep . or , maybe somewhere - kitten and puppy adoption is good .
1	6B	why do n't we just get rid of speed limit signs ? no one follows them anyway .
2	3I	i can see needing those for camping and fishing both , but also -
1	6B	well we could - i do n't know .
2	3I	but they 're little .
2	6B	it 's - yeah exactly . than it does to spay them . okay , keeping that . um .
2	3I	yeah . and i 'd say scissors , i 'm gon na put that above the paper .
1	6B	unhappy .
0	3I	yeah , we do n't .
1	6B	what we absolutely can not cut -
1	6B	good . but -
1	6B	okay , toxic waste disposal . uh , yeah . that - that seems -
1	3I	trunc yeah , uh , let 's say it is .
2	6B	you had , uh , holes in your staff .
1	3I	alright so , egg timers . and - we do - we have it - we do n't yet have a cooking equipment - oh , cake mixes . yeah , sure . or it could go by the eggs .
1	6B	yeah , i trunc i think a lotta the transportation stuff 's important .
1	3I	maybe , trunc i would say here or here ?
2	6B	excellent . moving right along .
2	6B	say i 'm not desecrating , i 'm just not gon na fly it .
0	6B	i guess it says a community . our committee in charge of -
1	3I	sure ! yeah , that 's a good spot .
0	6B	eight .
1	6B	so maybe we 'll come back to these ones if we do n't get seven . um -
2	3I	yeah , they sort of grouped toys and travel guides and books and stuff together and that - that seemed to work for me , when i read it . okay .
1	6B	uh , what about the hospital additions ?
1	6B	i - i think we 've done -
1	3I	somewhere - where do you think ? somewhere in here maybe .
2	6B	alright , so teaching certificates we should keep .
0	3I	look -
1	3I	just trunc stick it up there , maybe .
1	6B	yeah , maybe .
1	3I	yeah , maybe .
1	3I	yeah , maybe .
2	6B	go to the library ! yeah , do that .
1	6B	maybe there 's like , sort of a -
0	6B	nine , let 's see we 're - we were gon na get rid of the bus stops -
2	6B	hunting tags is state of washington .
2	6B	and we 'll keep the sex ed .
1	3I	or near the peat moss .
0	3I	and we 're done , we think .
1	6B	i mean , i 'd like to keep trunc as many as possible . do you wan na just do like - cut , like , two or three , or - ?
1	3I	okay . scissors . okay , let 's make a little - this is kinda -
2	3I	well let 's pick a different one and do that one later .
2	3I	up here ? or over here , for , like , hardware , gardening stuff .
2	6B	i mean , maybe the sex offender thing . or -
2	3I	box trunc i 'd put - i 'd put it by the trunc power cords , ? yeah , cuz it 's -
1	3I	siding , mouse traps , power cords , and .
1	3I	cushions for deck chairs . deck chairs . outdoors . yeah .
0	3I	cups .
0	3I	empty plastics jugs .
2	6B	that would be unpleasant to the microphone .
1	3I	forecasting , yes -
2	6B	institutions .
1	3I	sometimes you find em , sort of trunc before they -
0	6B	oh really ?
1	6B	yeah . i 'm - i 'm gon na read through them just to see how - where we are . yeah .
2	6B	that sorta trunc goes along - i think the veterinary hospital - i wonder if that is the same thing as like paws or something .
2	3I	we 'll make a new section .
0	6B	trunc i - that 's the only thing i can think is a public access - would that be , like , a place where you would go to get information about your community services or something ?
2	3I	well , i do n't know . if you 're gon na catch whales .
0	6B	i do n't -
0	6B	i do n't -
2	3I	we could put some tools in here . like , saw , box knives -
0	3I	pouches ?
2	6B	pretty nice to have a subway .
1	3I	okay , food . okay so yeah that 's fast , and canvas bags are gon na be over here by the tow ropes and the vests and things .
0	6B	is that , like , classifieds ?
1	3I	stick stuff together . sounds good .
0	6B	i think we trunc we 're at three , cuz we 're cutting -
1	6B	they could deal with a little less .
1	6B	mm . well , that 's true .
1	3I	trunc once you see the price and decide you do n't want brand new cushions you can get a roll of duct tape .
1	3I	um , yeah . toilet paper -
2	6B	i trunc well , now that i 'm using the bus system .
2	3I	okay , good . oh , rolls of duct tape . that 's good yeah , that 's great .
2	3I	think this 'll be our dairy type items .
1	3I	i do n't know . thick sweaters , that 's easy . by the heavy coats .
0	3I	duct tape . and box knives .
2	3I	but it trunc i mean , it could trunc i guess flow from kitchen-y , then to cups , then to buckets .
1	3I	cookies , next to - right here ?
1	3I	in the bathroom area , i guess .
1	3I	containers section .
1	3I	so looks like we 're done .
0	6B	recreation and public services . well , let 's see what we 've got on the list .
2	6B	trunc was that - when your car is towed , though -
1	3I	sort of shoe polish , tweezers -
1	3I	how bout down here ? yeah . okay .
1	3I	that 's a good -
0	6B	health and safety .
1	6B	okay , so pass on that one .
2	3I	it 's obviously one of those two .
2	6B	well yeah , but trunc i 'm not sure we can -
1	3I	i think it would be -
0	6B	what else would i cut ?
0	3I	and then matches .
1	6B	yeah , okay . sure .
2	3I	well - yeah-
1	3I	electric heater . you need that to heat up after your wetsuit . paper bags and large - or there - are there other like - um -
2	6B	we do n't need to continue funding poetry books . because they have poetry books .
1	3I	heaters and stoves could go .
1	6B	i 'm just not sure why -
1	3I	yeah , that one works and then bagels ?
1	3I	i guess if that was the case -
1	3I	trunc we do , yeah .
2	6B	well , additional bus stops are always nice .
2	6B	if you kept invasive species removal that takes care of most weeds .
1	3I	food , huh ?
2	3I	up there . right next to baking !
1	6B	part of stray cat - oh , stray cat spaying .
2	6B	yeah , they 're gon na have poetry books .
2	6B	or trunc too - well , i mean , you do n't want rogue tattoo artists , but still .
2	6B	whereas a fishing license and a hunting tag is a much , much smaller -
1	3I	i 'm trunc we may have a few of those like okay that just in -
2	3I	they are far .
2	6B	for example -
1	3I	uh , figs can go in baked stuff too .
2	3I	i hate to do that , but -
1	3I	good idea .
0	6B	what did we say ? um , toxic waste , hospital -
1	3I	stick it with the - yeah , stick it with the -
1	6B	chicken pox ?
2	3I	i do n't know what that is for but - i guess it 's a supply .
0	3I	mousetraps , , power cords -
1	6B	how - trunc how much money does that really cost ?
1	6B	yeah yeah yeah .
1	3I	yeah yeah yeah .
1	6B	okay . that 's one , i agree with that one . food bank - junior soccer league ?
0	3I	i do n't know , towards one end or the other , they 'll put things that are more impulse buys , because , trunc people are more likely to impulse buy like , at the beginning or end . i - i do n't remember the details .
2	3I	well , we have shoelaces . something else for the home .
1	3I	we can put bagels -
0	6B	and pest control . well . um -
2	6B	personally , i 'm not , like , a -
1	6B	well , what do you think ?
2	6B	perfect . awesome .
1	6B	so it 's not just everybody going for it .
1	3I	i do n't know , maybe we 'll go on the other side .
0	6B	boating license , pothole maintenance , subway , hunting tags , tunneling .
1	3I	that makes sense . that 's toiletries .
1	6B	nice .
1	6B	nice .
1	3I	nice .
1	3I	nice .
1	3I	nice !
1	3I	yeah . refrigera-
1	3I	arising from the chaos . boxes of donuts ! now i 'm getting hungry .
1	3I	well , somewhere over there .
2	3I	okay , let 's see . backpacks , that 's traveling stuff . i 'm gon na put it across from the gas-powered cookstove , because -
1	3I	which do you think ?
2	3I	okay , well - it looks we have better organization than we did on our lists . so -
2	6B	dang .
0	6B	oh , we 're getting rid of another one there ?
0	3I	go grab a couple of these suckers .
1	3I	kay , let 's put it right there .
1	6B	yeah , you ca n't get rid of that .
1	6B	you were thinking -
1	3I	oh , we can fill it in later . i still like the idea of putting that next to toys .
0	3I	liters of water . do we have any -
1	3I	what about in there ?
1	6B	so if you made across the board cuts , as often happens , twenty five percent -
1	6B	yeah , it would .
2	6B	i 've never heard of taxi stops . there 's taxis everywhere . they just stop wherever they want to stop .
0	6B	i live in king county .
2	6B	i 'd say put that in the no list too . we 'll decide - we 'll prioritize after .
2	6B	the neighborhood could -
2	3I	uh , home depot .
1	6B	want to get rid of -
2	3I	hmm , not in the kitchen .
1	3I	along with the sticks of butter , right ?
2	6B	i trunc i would n't wan na take away music teachers . i think it 's really important to have music .
1	6B	let 's the football stadium too .
1	6B	and then maybe the things for the kids ? the junior soccar league , and basketball club ?
1	3I	i 'm gon na put em down by the because -
1	3I	i 'll put it here for travel . yeah .
1	3I	i could - we could put it by our scissors .
1	3I	our random -
0	6B	uh . towing .
1	6B	we need to cut something . hospital additions . alright , so we 've got three -
0	3I	fishing nets .
0	6B	i dunno . yeah , after my bat mitzvah , and after like , not being in private school anymore , and kind of being -
0	3I	peat trunc
2	3I	hats and jackets should go with clothing of whatever -
2	6B	additional bus stops ? i maybe would n't say additional bus stops , because that , to me , sounds like they already have ten , and we wan na add more ?
1	3I	i do n't know , boating supplies or siding .
0	3I	and then socks . um .
2	3I	so i 'm thinking either kitchen or with the trunc things we 're storing in the basement .
2	6B	well , i do n't know how much of a problem it is now , but when i was teaching -
1	3I	yeah sure , sure , that 's a good spot for it right there .
2	3I	yeah , that would all be over here .
1	3I	wonder if the butter and the eggs though should go by the sugar .
0	6B	um , i 'm wondering if - public news station . i 'm wondering if it 's like the thing - the trunc someone was reminding me of this yesterday that seattle had this thing that was an open station . do you remember that on television ? on cable ? and anybody could sign up . and you had all these wackos that were there doing half hour shows . um . i do n't - yes . yes . i do n't know if , um , that 's what it means .
1	3I	ready made , right .
1	3I	trunc perfect .
1	3I	especially - shoelaces .
2	6B	um , repetitive impact brain injuries .
1	3I	we can have some candy .
2	6B	i feel like bagel factory inspections is very specific .
1	6B	i 'd say massage certificates .
1	3I	yeah , that sounds trunc logical .
1	3I	groceries .
1	6B	okay , those two . okay , so let 's go to the -
1	6B	mm-kay . question is news station and - ?
1	6B	alright . are we agreed ?
1	6B	oh . it does n't matter ?
2	6B	why is towing services on here ?
0	6B	is this the - ?
1	3I	yeah . but i do n't know if - yeah . that 's -
1	3I	near cookies .
1	6B	yeah . especially since we 're -
1	6B	yeah . i agree . i agree . now . we did three there . so recreation and public services . let 's see . what is a public news sta- ? oh , is that like k_ u_ o_ w_ ?
1	6B	that needs to be -
2	6B	if i had children , i would feel differently , but -
0	3I	um . trying to be quiet with them . alright .
2	6B	well . oh god , here we go .
1	6B	okay , we got five . yeah , five cut . okay , sounds good .
0	6B	considering the category .
1	3I	yeah . i 'm going to have - oops - ice cream .
0	3I	so what else - are we done ?
1	3I	over here . let 's do that .
0	3I	alright . i have beets .
1	6B	it 's getting more difficult , is n't it ?
2	6B	i mean if it 's - if it 's between those or one of the tutors , you know , trunc i certainly do n't wan na get rid of the custodians or the math tutors , for example .
1	3I	trunc do you think ?
0	6B	oh ! oh , like a - the t_v_ station for -
2	6B	yeah , yeah , trunc there 's four . i - i feel we could even get rid of the public news station .
1	3I	i dunno either . um .
1	6B	you were talking about invasive - yeah , exactly .
2	3I	well let 's see , because we - we only had - see , we 've got -
1	6B	how big of a problem invasive species are , and how much effort goes into them , and if that effort could be -
1	3I	across from them .
1	6B	so we 're good there .
1	3I	and the books of matches .
1	3I	is , uh - i guess kind of a housewares item for starting fires and things .
0	3I	thick sweaters , um -
1	3I	continue that theme .
2	6B	we 're gon na not fund junior soccer league because the community will pick it up .
1	3I	do we got bread stuff ?
2	3I	home . home stuff , does n't it ?
1	6B	yeah , i 'm not a big taxi person .
2	6B	well , i 'm thinking all the licenses should trunc pay for themselves , cuz people pay for those -
3	6B	animals . uh . see , i do n't trunc i feel like i do n't feel like have the authority to like cut things . cuz like i do n't care about hunting or tattoos . but , like people trunc i know . but like - it 's like people do those things . but like - i dunno .
1	6B	mess with the population , but if it was something more like -
1	3I	up just keep going ? yeah . okay . so we have socks .
1	3I	almost positively like either a camping or a - oh , it 's liters , not gallons . it 's small bottles of water .
1	3I	power trunc power cords ?
1	3I	trunc that 's probably -
2	6B	i guess so . but we do n't have them here . but we do n't know where we 're at , so - fishing licenses .
2	6B	well , we could theoretically cut one or the other of those and makes the other one take over .
2	3I	and then five-pound weights , um , probably where the toys are . maybe , like , the activities room or something .
1	6B	put those on . that 's true .
1	3I	no , but i think it - mouse trunc sort of household equipment .
1	3I	now this is interesting because it 's not individual bottles , but rather cases .
2	6B	speed limit signs uh -
2	3I	tweezers under magnets , and then these three .
2	3I	here 's the refrigerated section it looks like . with the ice cream and eggs .
2	6B	well you got ta - i would trunc i 'd say you 'd have to do at least two .
1	3I	trunc this is kinda camping trip stuff .
0	6B	what is that ?
0	3I	box knife -
1	3I	we have lots of room on one aisle .
1	3I	i dunno . we sell everything .
2	6B	a long way .
0	6B	how much hunting - well , it 's like when you go out and you kill something , if you have tags , you have a permit to kill that one animal , or five of those animals .
0	6B	alright , so we 've cut -
2	6B	well , the dog catcher picks up the puppies and the kittens . and then they adopt them out .
1	3I	well , i think the rule was trunc trunc what trunc trunc if it was already there we could n't move it but i think we can move our own stuff .
1	3I	um , but perhaps with a bit of space as they are a -
1	3I	uh , i do n't know .
2	6B	could be handled .
2	6B	i 'd knock that out .
1	3I	it 'll be it 's own bread section .
1	3I	up by the magnets , don'tcha think ?
1	3I	yeah , yeah . beets .
1	6B	the hunting tags and the fishing licenses should be together in the first place .
1	3I	well , how bout near pet food ?
0	3I	let 's see what they -
2	6B	you want them to be licensed . that 's a good point , actually .
1	3I	with eggs ?
1	3I	kitchen stuff , maybe ?
1	3I	oh yeah . yeah , yeah . over here somewhere .
2	3I	it should go around pre-cut wood , yeah . this kinda thing .
2	6B	okay , shut them down , shut them down .
1	6B	so let 's just think about these things . math tutors , assistant cooks , sex ed , custodians , speech therapy , football equipment , acting coaches , poetry books , special ed teachers , cooking classes , notetakers , sugar-free juice machines -
1	3I	the canned things . they also have ice cream up here . so that 's , like , sweets .
1	3I	kind of personal hygiene stuff .
0	6B	we 've cut two from each one .
1	6B	right . toxic waste disposal 's really important .
1	3I	maybe , trunc paper .
2	3I	trunc yeah , i 'm gon na stick - first of all , this right next to the toilet paper , maybe . this stuff , there .
0	3I	egg timers ?
0	3I	egg timers .
0	3I	egg timers -
0	3I	egg timers .
0	3I	egg timers .
0	3I	egg timers .
0	3I	egg timers .
1	3I	maybe in here somewhere ?
0	6B	okay , infrastructure and licensing .
1	6B	um , maybe ?
1	6B	should we have fishing licenses so that we - we do n't over fish places ? i do n't know .
0	3I	electric heaters , um -
1	3I	mm-hm also that same aisle trunc
1	3I	we are running out here .
2	6B	do you know what i mean ? like -
1	3I	right . mm-hmm . right .
1	3I	yeah . yeah yeah , let 's do that . let 's do .
0	6B	job training .
0	6B	job training .
0	6B	veterinary hospital is eight . we did nine , i think , from those other ones . so we could add -
1	6B	i 'd say maybe -
0	3I	kay . cushions for deck trunc chairs .
1	6B	so trunc this is just county .
2	6B	well they 're sorta the same th-
0	6B	where do you see that ?
1	6B	would be the poetry books , thought i 'd hate to do it . we 'd only have to cut one .
1	3I	next to the soybeans ?
1	3I	i think by the figs .
0	6B	math tutors , assistant cooks , custodians -
1	6B	we 'll think about it . boating . we should let them boat .
1	3I	how bout by books ?
1	3I	by power cords .
1	3I	it does . what if we put it right next to the buckets ?
2	3I	i 'm good at - alright , we have not left any place for clothes .
1	3I	oh that should go with scissors and - yeah . cool .
1	3I	what about next to the hats ?
2	6B	yeah . well - invasive species removal should do enough . yeah .
1	6B	dog - i mean , yeah . it says for cats . they should do dogs too , though .
1	3I	electric heaters . i would , uh , maybe put -
0	3I	and then uh -
2	3I	this is , like , kind of our cold area .
1	6B	and it 's - it 's something that it 's easy to get the community to fund .
2	3I	i do n't like beets . my son likes them .
1	3I	that 's it .
0	3I	between the sugar -
1	3I	perfect
1	6B	yeah . i know
0	6B	wow , my stomach is making a lot of noises i guess .
2	6B	i think they 're all very justified .
1	3I	that one down there .
2	3I	cushions for deck chairs . yeah , yeah , trunc yeah . oh , yeah , there you go . yeah , yeah ! yeah yeah .
1	3I	i trunc yeah , power cords you bet .
1	3I	perhaps with a bit of space down from the siding .
1	6B	well , i would sort of -
1	6B	kay , well , we 'll come back to that one .
0	6B	they - it 's private .
0	3I	see if i can remember -
1	3I	maybe we could like -
0	3I	uh are they canned or are they fresh ?
2	6B	yeah . do n't want random people touching you .
0	6B	um dog catcher ?
1	3I	that makes sense . mm-hm . yeah .
0	3I	oh cushions for deck chairs . uh -
1	3I	these are made .
1	6B	that 's kinda crazy .
1	6B	i - yeah .
1	6B	that 's silly . um . okay , moving on .
1	6B	yeah . think so .
1	3I	yeah . think so .
0	6B	and four .
1	6B	okay , so if we trunc a_ , we have to cut equal numbers from each one , so -
1	3I	toilet paper but it 's - it 's kind of a different -
1	6B	uh , we 're gon na keep the invasive species removal and the vaccinations , job training programs , and reproductive education .
2	6B	and i say sexually transmitted . because it should be under the other one .
1	6B	mm-hm , two so far .
1	3I	yeah , i would say cushions for deck chairs , kind of camp-
2	6B	yeah , i think that 's really . mm-hm . that 's what i 've heard .
2	3I	trunc power cords or siding ? siding goes outside . electric heaters ? okay .
2	6B	even part of the list ?
2	6B	i think i know one we might agree on at first but -
1	6B	do you wan na be done ?
1	6B	mm-hm . i think we should read through the whole list .
1	3I	i would probably put it there , too .
1	3I	half-inch - socks ! boy , i 'm getting easy ones here .
2	6B	to , uh -
2	6B	oh boy . now this .
2	6B	got ta have those .
2	6B	got ta have those .
1	6B	okay , there you go .
2	6B	or even trunc flagpole repair which - which - which nancy thinks is a frill .
1	6B	that 's -
2	6B	so , if education and programs . we need the math tutors .
2	6B	oh , but - but how about additional stops ? we do n't need additional stops .
2	6B	ah - actually , there is - there trunc there is a - there is a law about flying the flag in public buildings .
1	6B	um . so the assistant cooks maybe cut those guys . um .
0	6B	yeah , with the scary dog catcher .
1	3I	trunc oh , gosh , it 's such a big decision ! i do n't know ! um - uh , i - yeah , i do n't really know . go for it . okay .
2	6B	yeah , they 're important . um . speech therapy can be important - being in speech - like , if somebody 's in , like the speech department - i - it also is - only serves a select -
2	3I	by the refrigerated stuff , so maybe somewhere over on that column .
0	6B	tattoo artist licenses , boating licenses -
0	6B	tattoo artist licenses , boating licenses -
2	3I	well , this is in our - let 's put is across from boating supplies , because if you fall off the boat -
2	3I	really , it 's own thing , yeah there you go , i like the sound of that .
0	3I	here 's -
2	6B	and drainage ditches ? especially - especially in washington . i know . trunc trunc you look at , like - you see , like , it pour down rain in arizona , and there 's just , like , water everywhere . cuz they do n't have any trunc drainage ditches . i think we did good !
1	3I	of food .
1	6B	that could be , like , the next on the list to go .
1	6B	no , we ca n't .
2	3I	eggs . how bout eggs - no , how bout egg timers next to the eggs ?
1	6B	that 's a good thing . i do n't know .
1	6B	pays very much for basketball clubs . i think that can go .
1	6B	uh , reproductive - yeah , go into the reproductive .
1	6B	right . right , more the health -
2	6B	some would say that could go online .
0	6B	they 're online .
2	6B	is n't that already private anyways ?
0	3I	no , i have n't .
0	3I	i do n't know what that is anyway .
1	3I	by the eggs ?
1	6B	things like -
0	6B	has to be the -
0	3I	we-
3	6B	i mean , who really watches the public trunc access station ? that 'd be pretty easy to cut . and then no one would notice except for like , a few people in the retirement home .
0	3I	peas and soy beans .
1	3I	matches . i 'm not sure if those should go with -
1	6B	um , although it 's it 's pretty different .
2	6B	oh , trunc there 's a weed control ? yeah . trunc yeah . toxic waste disposal 's important . hospital additions are -
1	3I	chocolate bars . well , let 's just put it with ice cream .
1	3I	technic-
0	3I	where 'd we put the clothing , with the - ? yeah , yeah , yeah .
1	3I	put it with the -
2	6B	all they have to do is get together and do it .
2	3I	sounds good . got some half inch tubing that 'll go over on the far left side with the heavy cable , five pound weights .
1	6B	okay . and football equipment ?
2	3I	actually , five-pound weights would go in , uh - would go in , uh , physical fitness stuff , but we do n't have a trunc section for that .
0	3I	which scissors did we order , emily ? i ca n't seem to recall .
1	6B	well , we 're taking out sugar free juice . yeah .
0	6B	veteran 's medical assistance .
1	3I	yeah it would .
2	6B	that 's tough , cuz those are -
1	3I	by the small saws ?
2	3I	maybe - we 're kinda going in to kitchen stuff here , like with this - i trunc
1	3I	next to mouse traps , maybe ? i don-
2	6B	but we could always postpone a year .
1	3I	bundles of sticks . i guess it 's kinda outdoorsy ?
1	3I	maybe down here ?
1	3I	maybe down here ?
2	6B	nobody would come after you .
1	3I	yeah . in the boating supplies . okay .
3	6B	let 's get rid of the taxi stops .
1	3I	tweezers . bathroom -
2	6B	you have to keep your public buses -
1	6B	i would do the -
1	3I	trunc no , it 's fine .
2	3I	matches in your home , too .
1	6B	towing services , trunc trunc massage certificates , and taxi stops , so we can keep one of those . which one do we wan na keep ?
1	6B	that 's - yes
0	6B	football stadium upkeep and pest control okay .
1	6B	okay , then i say yes .
1	3I	we could do , like -
2	6B	my son did .
2	3I	ooh , butter .
0	6B	soup kitchens , housing assistant , dog catcher .
0	3I	mm , what aisle though ?
1	3I	the firewood type things are bundles of sticks , axes -
1	6B	and hope it was enough .
1	3I	near toys ?
2	3I	yeah . well , we do have cake mix and sugar here but those are not ready-to-eat .
2	6B	no . but i think - i think that public - yeah . i think that public news stations are important just because of the - of the -
2	6B	neighborhood watch support . i would say it 's quite probably that if there is a neighborhood would they will be able to fund themselves for the -
2	6B	and you got ta have custodians . sex ed 's really important .
1	6B	yeah , and i 'm - i 'm -
0	3I	oh , we had something for , like -
1	3I	how bout here ?
1	3I	how bout here ?
2	6B	they can take the bus or they can take the subway . so , okay , sure . tattoo and taxi . yes , we 're done . we are finished .
1	3I	yeah , kinda hardware-y stuff .
2	3I	oh . see - trunc that 's very - i think that 's a - yeah - just and what 's so interesting is the gender thing . how tweezers you see as a small tool , i 'm like -
1	3I	hats with the backpacks and the -
1	6B	educational , -
1	3I	mm , say with the backpacks , in that area .
1	6B	okay , first of all , let 's read through it . stray cat spaying .
1	3I	yeah with the drinks .
1	3I	pouches of oatmeal . so that 's um - that 's with uh -
1	3I	ah , the egg timers .
2	6B	i 'd rather cut -
1	3I	i do n't have any preference . uh , so tow ropes because those go -
1	3I	butter . okay , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
1	3I	which i 'd put more up towards like a sweet -
1	3I	oh , lets put that across from the -
1	3I	i do n't know , cake mix ?
1	3I	so , should i put it by cake mix ? yeah .
2	3I	i 'm trying to think what else - there were some sort of electrical-y things that could go more around the power cords . trunc were n't there a couple electric type things ?
2	3I	okay , sure . um - let 's be non-committal and put it in the middle .
1	3I	sounds ideal .
2	6B	and there are only so many tattoo artists and massage therapists who can work in a given area , right ?
2	3I	it 's creepy , it 's very creepy . cuz i live on a busy street , so i 'm used to -
1	6B	neighbors do it anyway .
1	6B	yeah , and also like -
1	3I	or we did sorta fill that up .
0	6B	veterans ' medical assistance , egg farm regulations , weed control -
2	6B	we need that . yeah .
1	3I	either way .
2	6B	it 's essential . yeah , yeah .
0	3I	does that make sense ? okay .
0	6B	is n't that , like , animal control ?
1	6B	does n't it seem like it could be a private thing too ?
2	6B	let 's see , reproductive education we definitely need that chicken pox vaccinations , i like .
2	3I	that sounds good . i 've got some rolls of duct tape which i 'm just gon na put underneath the siding here . cuz you can use one to repair the other .
2	6B	they were n't - the city did n't provide them with anything . the food banks were run voluntarily by -
1	3I	item .
1	3I	in this area ?
1	3I	and large vests . how bout boating supplies ?
1	6B	or add something back .
1	3I	yeah . well i 'm thinking that 's no trunc could also go with face - face cream though .
0	3I	let 's see . five-pound weights .
1	3I	yeah , that makes sense .
1	3I	yeah , that makes sense .
1	3I	yeah , that makes sense .
1	3I	yeah , that makes sense .
1	3I	yeah , that makes sense .
1	3I	yeah , that makes sense .
2	6B	you trunc you know , the reality - the reality of - of - cutting items is that every single item on the budget -
2	3I	yeah , that 's what i was thinking . the electric heaters , trunc we were saying could go near the power cords .
2	3I	i think they go near the boating supplies . that sounds good .
2	6B	acting coaches . cuz , trunc i mean you can have like drama directory without acting coaches , yeah . i think we should cut that .
1	3I	okay , i 'll put it above ice cream .
0	3I	um , sticks of butter .
2	3I	how bout this ?
1	6B	mm-kay , so let 's see -
1	6B	um , okay let 's see .
0	6B	public access sta-
1	3I	something across the way would be logical ?
2	6B	massage cer- ? that 's a very specific -
0	6B	did we have speech therapy ? i think we did .
2	6B	we already are over at hanford .
1	6B	a soda trunc i mean -
1	6B	prenatal check-ups , neighborhood watch support - okay i ready to - i 'm ready to hit some stuff here .
2	6B	that and it 's a major capital .
1	3I	introduction to baked goods .
1	3I	like , fish hooks and -
2	6B	i think - i mean i 'd if we have to cut stuff . and to me i think assistant cooks -
2	6B	flagpole trunc oh , we - and taxi stops , we 'd can that .
2	3I	there 's a couple - yeah , there 's a couple arguments . um -
2	6B	sex offender database . that 's , i think , pretty important .
1	3I	refrigerator magnets ? so we 'll just place it beside refrigerator magnets .
1	3I	that would go here maybe ? well -
1	6B	a great commendable program , but -
3	3I	well , how bout your clothing over here ?
1	3I	yep . i think so .
1	6B	any toxic trunc mm - i guess we need to do - take care of .
1	6B	kinda falls into the soccer league category .
2	6B	along with hospital - hospital additions , and needle exchange , so let 's trunc leave those for now .
1	3I	unquestionably .
2	6B	would you want them to not do that and lose all of the trees in washington .
2	3I	doughnuts . with - cookies . they should be with bagels cuz they 're like the same except this one 's - worse for you i guess .
1	3I	right , right . true . like , so this is consumable but where do we want it ? like , how are we ranging this ?
1	6B	fishing licenses , that 's revenue . upkeep -
0	6B	um , soup kitchens , housing assistance , dog catcher -
1	3I	i 'm thinking flammability .
0	3I	ugh .
2	3I	yeah , by the eggs . breakfast .
1	3I	oh , we can start a new one .
1	3I	start a little -
0	3I	plastic jugs . tow ropes .
2	6B	no , let 's keep the veterinary hospital .
1	3I	we can go with box knives for now .
1	6B	nice . we got it .
0	3I	peat moss is right here .
2	3I	but trunc i-
1	3I	foods .
2	3I	or it could be up by -
2	6B	that kinda , um seems like it would fall inta the same category as football equipment .
2	6B	they all look good .
0	6B	and then under infrastructure , this was our limiting one .
1	6B	well , okay . so um -
1	3I	is it ? oh yeah .
1	6B	wait , as you said , football gets too much money already , right ?
2	6B	there are n't enough of them .
1	6B	it 's a maybe again .
2	6B	we 'll just take them all down , here , and , uh , you can fly them in your yard .
1	3I	i guess they are n't -
1	3I	gas powered cookstoves . well , we know that 's got ta be -
2	6B	i do n't know , cuz we - you get state and federal money for it .
2	6B	probably not as essential as -
0	3I	household items of -
1	6B	there may - uh , yeah , they 're - they 're important . it depends on like what kind of math obviously . um but if - if - if i think it 's like - everyday stuff like um -
1	3I	yeah , i 'd put that -
1	3I	electric , nobody cooks with -
0	6B	yeah , we were sending kitty and puppy trunc adoptions - outsourcing that to -
1	6B	but like - yeah .
1	3I	how bout water , put up here ?
1	3I	or do we want it by the -
1	3I	canvas bags . all of them around there .
2	3I	mint toothpaste , that would be there in the bathroom , would n't it ?
2	6B	well , cuz we 've only been doing three on the lists .
1	3I	maybe we could put it over trunc oh . what do you think ? would you prefer to put it by like the - these items - ?
1	6B	at least - at least now , in here , if we 're doing that .
2	3I	but we ca n't move them .
2	6B	notetakers , disability services . ooh , i do n't think you can do that .
1	6B	i 'd rather be feeding people .
0	6B	oh . to do that ?
2	3I	well , i 'd - i 'd put probably in this column or possibly in this , but certainly not over there .
2	6B	yeah . sorry , i had to sneeze , heather . um , neighborhood watch support , you think then might - it 's definitely we have to keep pre-natal checkups .
0	3I	boxes of donuts .
1	3I	can of peas , down by the beets .
2	3I	scissors . this is like office supplies .
1	3I	we could do , like , under the soybeans .
1	3I	nice . perfect
0	6B	um , additional bus stops -
0	6B	math , assistant cooks , sex ed , custodians , speech therapy ,
1	3I	it does n't specify if it 's fresh beets .
2	3I	well , we do n't know what kinda vests they are .
2	6B	uh , notetakers just falls in to the same category to me as special ed teachers .
1	6B	veterinary hospitals , that 's important .
0	6B	i wonder if those are those marketing support programs trunc you go into a restroom and see a -
0	6B	okay . veterinary hospital ?
2	6B	cause that could go private .
1	6B	taxis . did we - do taxi stops ? cuz i still do n't know if they are -
2	3I	that goes with boats .
1	3I	or we could have it at the bot-
1	3I	but not with the -
2	6B	it 's seems like a good service , but it also seems kinda like , um -
0	6B	i 'm going extreme in my head .
1	6B	out .
0	3I	box knives . oh ! to open boxes .
1	3I	trunc probably are already books .
0	6B	yeah . so the public access station , i wonder what the difference is between that and the news station . is that like more for trunc emergency stuff ?
1	6B	i think it 's important , too .
2	3I	and the cake mix . it would make sense - well , i think these three would make sense , the figs , chocolate , and oatmeal . what do you think ?
2	3I	so this - this aisle seems like this a food aisle .
2	6B	we can come back to it . pothole maintenance . yes , very important .
1	3I	disposable household items . that makes sense .
2	6B	towing services but the public bus upkeep is important .
1	6B	think we 're -
1	6B	uh , so i would - towing services , yeah .
1	6B	um , soup kitchens are important . um housing assistance -
1	3I	large vests ! ah , we have more clothes .
2	6B	holistically are - more - important .
0	6B	we 're -
1	6B	speed limit signs , we should keep .
2	6B	well , the trunc but my feeling is that the-
1	3I	absolutely . oh yes . and the cases of whiskey . ca n't forget the cases of whiskey .
1	3I	electric heaters , so power cords ?
1	6B	i think that 's also really important .
2	6B	okay , yeah . that 'll help .
1	6B	oh . well let 's look at the next and see - i do n't know .
2	6B	you ca n't really -
2	6B	not on the east coast .
1	6B	public news station , i ca n't think what that would be . i mean trunc it could be public radio or p_b_ like -
1	6B	i think they should stay , for the moment .
2	6B	um - but -
2	3I	here 's another one that can go right there .
2	6B	yeah , i think it 's important for public health , too , if you wan na keep , like , teenage pregnancies down . okay , so we 'll keep that for sure . custodians , clearly important .
0	3I	gas-powered cook stove . yeah .
2	3I	books - i do n't know . well , we can leave that -
1	6B	i think that is - yeah , say . like , i feel like you can incorporate trunc them somewhere else .
3	6B	see , that 's sick . that 's just sick .
1	3I	may i put sticks up there too ?
2	6B	promoting crap food for the kids .
2	6B	now there 's two things here . education , sex ed and reproductive education . you could take one outta one of those lists .
1	6B	pre-natal care .
0	6B	uh - u-
2	6B	ok. well , i wonder if reproductive has to do with -
0	6B	football and -
1	3I	good thinking .
2	6B	well that 's - that 's - that 's a borderline . we 'll see what happens with the rest of it .
1	6B	maybe the people need to -
0	6B	um , pothole maintenance
2	3I	i 'm not sure what they mean by tow ropes . like to hook onto a trunc yeah , it should go in a garage . kinda thing . no matter what .
1	3I	? is that good here ?
2	6B	i 'm an environmentalist , so i would keep that . but i would maybe get rid of neighborhood watch support .
1	3I	um , so heavy coats and , like -
1	3I	shoot .
1	3I	travel guides ? mousetraps ?
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts .
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts .
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts ?
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts .
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts .
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts .
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts .
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts .
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts .
1	6B	i guess pass on that one . uh , pothole maintenance .
2	6B	which is kinda cool .
1	3I	since we have room -
0	6B	is that , like -
1	6B	i 'd have to get rid of that .
1	3I	and wetsuits of course , same trunc right below -
0	6B	island .
1	3I	i 'd say trunc somewhere over here . yeah , sure .
2	6B	oh . i was thinking of housing assistance . cuz - you know - in my - my district we do n't have poor people .
1	3I	do n't know if we have anything like books .
1	3I	that 's a boating . well trunc could be boating , could be car .
2	3I	what do you think , somewhere over here ? since we have all this space for food ?
1	6B	i dunno . it can be important but -
0	3I	it 's trunc trunc trunc here it 's sort of all -
2	6B	yeah , yeah , we could just cover in reproductive , yeah .
1	6B	clearly .
2	6B	it - trunc yeah . we should n't cut it if we do n't know what it is . so . we 'll just keep that . sex offender database is probably important as well .
1	3I	mousetraps .
1	6B	we could start off with just picking some - random number . and then -
2	3I	alright . i 've got some light jackets that will go great -
2	6B	although i 'm - i mean i - almost any youngster i know -
0	6B	sex offender
2	6B	i think of taxi stops as being more urban than county .
2	6B	yeah , i mean , that 's three . cuz if we do the additions and the weed control , neighborhood watch support , that 's three .
1	6B	no . i - i 'm not either .
0	3I	what kind of weights are these - ? are we talking - ?
1	6B	okay , but if we had to take something off of this list and -
1	3I	solid store organization .
0	6B	oh , like a community center ? maybe .
2	6B	why it 's hard - it 's hard to pick things to cut . but then you can look at like , politicians , you think they 're jerks cuz it 's , like , how can you cut something for animals ? and it 's , like , well compared to something else - right .
1	3I	maybe in the school-y type area ?
1	3I	okay , with the tubing .
2	6B	that one 's tough .
1	3I	that would be with the , uh , siding and buckets and stuff .
1	6B	control . yeah . in washington , too , so -
1	3I	uh . okay . that 's uh -
1	6B	sex offender database , veteran 's medical assistance and then we have three more to keep .
1	3I	that sounds perfect .
1	6B	yeah , i think so too . so , there 's our six , and then we have -
1	3I	canned food .
0	6B	hm
1	3I	uh-huh . kay .
1	6B	i 'm -
1	6B	in order to -
1	3I	small axes with the box knives and -
1	3I	as we have plenty of things in the camping outdoor-ware section .
1	3I	maybe - maybe by toys .
1	6B	yeah , cuz we - we wan na have - yeah .
2	3I	i 'm gon na put bottles of water and whiskey together . and liters of water .
0	6B	okay . oh , okay .
1	6B	okay , sex offender database ?
1	3I	yeah , we do n't - oh , books . um -
0	3I	and you thought it was camping .
2	6B	so , i 'm wondering why the county needs a veterinary hospital .
2	6B	because we - s-
1	3I	so next to the rolls of duct tape and power cords , but need immediately adjacent . alright .
2	6B	pest control we need , veterinary hospital i suppose we need .
1	6B	i guess trunc i do n't know how harmful , like , having weeds grow up on the side of the road could be , you know ? so - probably not ?
2	3I	yeah , they should be together . sh-
1	6B	yeah . assistant cooks and - and um - acting coaches .
2	3I	maybe it 's - maybe it 's fishing books . eh , just put it next to the books .
1	3I	maybe closer to the toys .
1	6B	let 's look at this whole list .
1	3I	again , it 's pretty clearly one of these two .
2	6B	i 'd be down for that . football gets too much funding .
2	6B	okay . you hafta have custodians , you hafta have sex ed . assistant cooks ?
1	3I	next trunc power cords ?
0	6B	like registered massage therapists . like trunc like that work in chiropractor offices , and stuff ?
2	3I	yeah , or the boating supplies there , yeah .
1	3I	one at a time ?
1	3I	we could run a store together . pre-cut wood .
1	3I	let 's put them between the boots and the toys .
1	3I	toiletries .
0	3I	when you 're in a hurry for something -
1	3I	then that should go with those , right ?
0	6B	yeah , all that stuff . yeah .
1	6B	so if we 're to cut four -
2	3I	i think it would go with probably -
2	6B	publicly funded hospital .
1	3I	cases of whiskey ? with the juice ?
1	6B	okay . you trunc ?
1	6B	could be a loxory .
1	3I	okay , we 'll put them next to the boating supplies .
3	6B	i think trunc we have to remember that the - the extra-curricular stuff is important . like , i would definitely not wan na get rid of the poetry or the cooking class , so we probably got ta keep the football equipment for that kinda kid . right ?
3	6B	yeah , we do n't need basketball . that 's fine . we do n't win in the olympics anyways . the n_b_a_ 's a joke .
2	3I	yeah , see i thought there were for , like , starting fires too . which went with camping . yeah . yeah .
2	6B	that 's - well , i mean , it 's just a program , it 's , like , an acting program . so we have , like , the music program , we got the math program . i might trunc we - maybe we keep the acting one , and we cut the poetry books .
0	6B	like wayne 's world , actually . that - that whole idea behind that , yeah . on t_v_ .
2	3I	yes , we did !
1	3I	have it - yeah , over .
1	6B	but we can choose - here or there .
1	3I	yes . cuz -
2	6B	well , you have to have teaching certificates .
1	6B	and there 's national
1	3I	hm . mm-hm . mm-hm .
2	3I	lots of them ? maybe for storage . what do you think ?
0	6B	boys basketball club , public -
2	3I	which , we have a clothing section . i 'm putting it right underneath the fleece lined boots .
1	6B	no i have n't talked about hospital additions . i mean i think that that -
2	6B	and you 're gon na pay them , uh , six hundred dollars . it 's trunc it 's all cash .
1	6B	kay , teaching certificates you think ?
0	6B	yeah . a trunc my first thought was - cuz it came after football , is a guy who 's , uh - uh , just trunc standing in - yeah , but that 's - that would , but -
2	6B	weed control . i - i 'd like to make that just the individual homeowner 's responsibility an-
1	3I	we - that 's the word .
2	3I	well , should be over here .
2	3I	and fish hooks goes with boating supplies .
1	3I	pet food , okay .
0	3I	see -
2	3I	usually with the cooking stuff . yeah . i think so .
2	6B	let 's throw that one on there . okay , hunting tags .
2	3I	we could !
1	3I	all our baking supplies in
2	6B	interested in that - getting rid of that , too , cuz that 's usually -
0	6B	uh , community news ads ?
0	3I	oh , i have buckets in my trunc
1	3I	flatware , and houseware , and cookware area or whether we want -
2	3I	should we - ? well -
1	3I	you wan na go first ?
1	3I	how bout right near the power cords ?
0	3I	let 's see , box knives , toys -
0	6B	bagel factory .
1	3I	well , that 's a -
1	6B	yes , i think we did .
2	6B	some department somewhere responsible for it .
2	3I	well - or it - cooking supplies . is there household cooking ? i mean -
2	6B	the trunc city 's bus -
0	6B	it 's four .
0	6B	it 's four .
0	6B	and weed control is - not marijuana , but -
0	6B	and parent - er parent . neighborhood - yeah , neighborhood watch support - i do n't -
3	3I	this is just think - my brain this is - in a trunc i know ! this is in a freezer !
1	6B	for trunc equally .
1	3I	which - which do you think is more appropriate ?
0	6B	uh-
0	3I	uh
2	3I	it 's all food . this is -
1	3I	power cord items . books ? should we put that with these there , with the scissors and loose leaf paper ?
1	3I	the maintenance kind of items .
1	3I	perfect , then we have our -
0	3I	no frills ones .
1	3I	i will let you make the decision .
2	3I	how bout right here ?
2	3I	what ? yeah , and it does n't look like there is any other clothing up , so -
1	3I	bathroom stuff . dried figs .
2	6B	i think soup kitchens -
1	6B	need it .
2	3I	trunc there 's a be a lot more food , i think . but yeah , we can put there .
1	3I	oh , there you go . let 's - let 's make it camping . yeah . okay .
1	3I	loose leaf paper . i 'll go - yeah , trunc
2	3I	it 's trunc yeah , it 's gon na everything .
1	3I	good . um -
1	6B	let 's interpret it as you did .
1	6B	well , maybe three . maybe we only end up being able to cut three .
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs , once again .
1	6B	look for the weak spot in each column , look for the one thing that stands out as the most negotiable . i mean , even though everything 's important .
1	3I	maybe - maybe at the bottom ? down there i guess ?
1	3I	dried figs . to me that 's -
2	6B	that should be under public health . um -
0	6B	yeah just so trunc they do n't produce more .
1	3I	um yeah , somewhere in here .
1	3I	it 's okay . alright , tweezers - it 's okay . tweezers should be going with the toilet paper , and mint toothpaste , but we 've run out of space . so i 'm gon na -
2	6B	subway system , i 'm on the fence about . for those who use it , it 's very important , but we already have buses .
0	3I	pre-cut wood and heavy cable .
2	6B	i do n't think we can cross the streams , no .
1	6B	i mean it 's - there 's actually programming to be seen on that .
1	6B	gee ! what do you cut from that ?
0	3I	yeah , there was an ax . there was a small ax .
1	6B	you know - tattoo artists i would certainly hope that they 're licensed .
1	3I	okay so , here 's heavy coats so here 's starting of clothes - so maybe here we have a whole aisle that trunc does n't have anything .
0	3I	yeah . we 're done !
2	6B	tow your own -
1	3I	but - yeah - we could put it with toys , or shoelaces , or pet food , or mouse traps .
1	6B	maybe that could be outsourced , too .
2	3I	this is , like , the outdoor - yes .
2	3I	i think so . that 's how i think of it , yeah .
1	6B	well , we can get rid of -
1	6B	agree .
1	3I	here or here ?
0	6B	trunc trunc what are -
1	3I	trunc i would trunc you could put it down with mousetraps .
0	6B	public access is more like the - that cable station .
0	3I	alright . let 's see .
1	3I	camping stores , and we have -
2	3I	bags of peat moss , i 'm gon na put that over here .
1	3I	here 's sort of miscellaneous .
2	3I	uh , that 'll do . or next to power cords .
1	3I	yeah , let 's - okay . go ahead and take some .
1	6B	see . public health and safety gets to be a - a difficult one , does n't it ?
1	3I	oh , there they are . okay . yeah , i guess right around there . would you prefer here , or here ?
1	6B	well maybe we should say weed control .
2	3I	cuz when you 're on the toilet you 're gon na like lift weights . kay well - oh , trunc can we do that ? okay .
1	6B	yeah oh yeah yeah .
2	6B	you very thoughtful person .
1	6B	i 'm not saying keep it or leave it . it does seems a little on the -
0	3I	large vests . oh , so do we have any - any -
2	6B	is , like , all three high schools use it . um , trunc football teams use it , like , the parks and recs teams , um , they do , like , cancer walks there . like , it 's - it 's , like community - it 's a community thing , so i think that would be important . um -
2	6B	i - i personally - i think i would cut that and just - i mean if they wan na -
2	3I	then large vests . i 'll hand these to you .
1	6B	i 'm trying to think trunc i mean , a dog catcher sounds trunc i - i - it 's important , but i 'm trying to think -
1	6B	i think that 's it .
1	6B	no matter what we do .
1	6B	and cooking classes .
0	3I	at this point .
1	3I	you wan na do em , like , here ?
2	6B	are not - acting coaches .
2	6B	yeah that seems like a logical one to cut .
2	3I	trunc trunc yeah , or -
2	6B	neighborhood watch support could go . pre-natal checkups ca n't go .
1	6B	was s_t_d_s .
1	6B	that can be cut , i should say .
0	6B	um . what else would i cut ?
2	6B	we 'll think about it . man , trunc that 's important . i do n't think we should cut that .
1	3I	i - uh - i have n't even found those in my store yet .
2	6B	i think we 're clear enough .
0	3I	cable ? is that -
1	6B	i would let -
1	6B	disabled kids you almost - who - who need speech therapy you almost have to have it , do n't you ?
1	3I	oh ! perhaps -
2	3I	heavy coats . oh no , we 've run out of space !
2	6B	increase the dog catcher .
1	6B	un . yeah .
1	3I	um , tow ropes , probably down here .
3	6B	yeah ! if they love to watch football so much , then they can clean up the stadium .
1	3I	do you refrigerate your water or not ?
0	3I	okay . yep . it is .
2	6B	so i think we trunc do n't fund that until they make it co-ed . yeah . yeah . um . trunc
2	6B	along with the notetakers .
1	3I	these are kind of our miscellaneous items .
2	6B	so anyone who is not under that can carry , um , a - an ounce , or whatever it is , of marijuana .
0	3I	oh . that -
2	6B	nobody listens to them anyhow .
0	3I	i said bagels .
2	3I	put it next to the large cups , cuz they are containers also .
2	6B	so we need to keep math tutors , assistant cook-
0	3I	mm . say -
2	6B	i 'm not really sure what that means . oh , like adding on to the hospital . mm .
1	3I	okay , so where are clothes gon na go ?
1	6B	that 's - stray cat spaying is something different -
1	3I	okay . scissors should go where the , um -
2	3I	yeah , think about that ! soybeans .
2	6B	alright , yeah . let 's do that .
1	3I	sweets , which we sort of - but that 's okay .
1	3I	alrighty . and books of matches , maybe with the refrigerator magnets , egg timers - or should we - ?
2	6B	am a big subscriber to home ec , and i think it should be co-ed .
2	3I	mm . oh , okay . you 're doing a fine job .
1	3I	sounds good . fish hooks ? next to -
0	3I	our aisle is - is - has been used up . i guess the rule was once we put it down we ca n't move it .
2	6B	i 'd say no .
2	6B	i 'd say no .
1	3I	so my inclination is to actually put them across from boating supplies .
1	3I	is n't it ?
2	6B	okay . so there 're our three .
0	6B	veterans medical assistance ?
3	3I	heavy coats . next to the thick sweaters !
1	3I	socks here , maybe ?
1	3I	trunc ish .
1	3I	yeah , under boating supplies .
2	3I	trunc trunc i do n't know about trunc cups i can see that .
2	3I	that 's not bad ! that 's not bad . .
1	3I	we 're outta room for -
2	6B	no , but i mean getting rid of that instead of massage or tattoo .
1	6B	prenatal check-ups . you got ta have that for low income people , right ?
0	3I	alright , so where do we start here ?
0	3I	we do n't have clothing yet .
0	6B	housing
0	6B	public news , foodbank -
2	6B	yeah who trunc who cares about the bagel factories .
0	3I	fishing net .
0	3I	fishing net -
0	3I	fishing net !
0	3I	fishing net .
0	3I	fishing net .
0	3I	fishing net .
1	3I	what you think ?
1	3I	hm , travel gear perhaps with the travel guides ?
2	6B	that were set aside already .
1	6B	well let 's go for king county .
0	6B	so what have we - we 've taken out -
2	3I	fleece-lined boots , that 's clothes .
3	6B	i would say instead of the public access station .
1	3I	box knives . bars of soap . that can go - is this okay ? cool .
1	3I	let 's put it below here .
0	6B	what 's - ?
1	3I	i have a small axes . maybe with the wood ?
1	3I	so somewhere over here .
1	3I	do you wan na just start trunc doing that here ?
1	3I	electric trunc electric heaters . household items , maybe , huh ?
2	6B	and they 're trunc they 're doing that now . they 're working on it .
2	6B	yeah , it seems kinda unnecessary .
1	6B	sex ed , do we agree that we should keep ?
0	6B	just staying there for a while , yeah yeah .
1	6B	budget reduction .
1	3I	okay , above the toys ? the books above the toys ?
1	6B	individual .
1	6B	decide . okay , we can keep -
2	3I	heavy cable . man , we 're just taking trunc around - power cords ! yeah .
1	3I	yeah . soybeans . yeah , that 's kinda , like -
1	6B	and maybe the football stadium .
2	3I	scissors , i 'm gon na put next to the tape .
1	3I	pull it -
1	3I	um well here 's our , like , electric crap
1	3I	seems good . okay . half inch tubing .
1	3I	hey that 's - yeah .
1	3I	buckets trunc empty . where was that empty -
1	3I	and these guys go up with egg timer ?
2	6B	yeah . got ta bring em in to the kitty and trunc
1	3I	heavy cable . power cords , heavy cable . though , it -
1	3I	yeah , and then we can have some things underneath .
2	3I	no . that 's - that 's like - is this walking down the aisle and down the left you have the sugar and on the right you have ice cream ?
1	3I	why do n't we just make it now a -
2	6B	i mean , if you 're in montana , there 's not a whole lot you 're gon na boat on . but , um -
2	3I	but we 're not supposed to move those !
2	3I	what is peat moss ? that goes over here , right ?
1	3I	do n't know what you do with em .
1	3I	fish hooks . well we 've got all this stuff but - but i - i know . so i 'm gon na overlap it a little bit . trunc let 's do that .
2	6B	towing away to the tow yard for the parking tickets .
1	6B	flag pole you repair . you sorta need it .
0	3I	what is the word i am looking for ?
1	6B	the additional bus stops ? because , you know , for disadvantaged people that 's how they get around and -
2	3I	above the mousetraps .
0	6B	okay , here 's the trunc football equipment .
1	3I	is that trunc recreation ?
1	3I	cuz scissors , right ?
1	6B	uh , public bus upkeep , yes . fishing licenses is state of washington .
2	3I	oh , man i would think two again .
0	6B	drainage ditches .
0	6B	drainage ditches .
0	6B	drainage ditches .
2	3I	so far that does n't seem to match any -
0	6B	is -
0	6B	is -
0	3I	uh , do we - where are the scissors ?
0	6B	boy 's basketball .
2	6B	got ta -
1	3I	so yeah , yeah .
1	6B	that we agree can be removed .
1	3I	it does n't mater to me which way -
1	6B	veteran 's medical assistance . yeah . egg farm regulations .
1	3I	me too .
1	6B	me too .
1	6B	me too .
1	3I	canvas bags might be sort of travel .
1	6B	i do n't know how well -
1	3I	we 're back to the food section . somewhere -
0	6B	oh , football equipment ? oh .
1	6B	let them do their own ? okay cuz we have to have pest control .
1	3I	you know , they 're breakfast-y
1	6B	but we have veterinary hospital , so maybe it could happen through that .
1	6B	oh i . that 's - that 's something n-
2	3I	let 's put those above mouse trap , yeah .
1	6B	trunc disabilities . oh , i spose note-takers are - uh .
1	6B	if i could only pick , like , what 's the single highest - what 's the top funding list . for me , i guess it 's the math tutors .
2	3I	but we do have refrigerator magnets here . we could put it over here .
0	6B	do you think they do trunc do you think they 'll do funding drives ?
0	3I	okay cookies .
2	6B	yeah . not around here . maybe in the south .
2	6B	so here 's triple a_ trunc towing , they call them up
0	6B	yes , and -
1	3I	probably with the -
0	6B	maybe in this false scenario they trunc they regulate tattoo artists ?
2	3I	do you want it with -
0	6B	we kinda said -
2	6B	a budget that 's - yeah . weed control and , unfortunately , invasive species removal .
0	3I	is that over here ?
1	3I	um , something over here i guess .
1	6B	and the subway system -
2	3I	we could put that by well , we could put that by the -
1	6B	okay , so you wan na take out poetry ?
1	6B	yeah . we can -
2	6B	just - we 'll just call them plants . they 're plants .
2	6B	kind of - it 's a subway for like a mile and a half .
0	6B	but we took out teaching certificates .
0	6B	of like , events .
1	3I	home depot section .
1	3I	yeah , let 's - let 's keep it - yeah . all that stuff 's in the middle already .
2	6B	um it does seem important but is the government paying for it ?
0	6B	stations . but that - then again that would be like - that 's like getting rid of k_u_o_w_ right ? yeah . mm-kay .
1	3I	yeah , let 's do it over there . okay .
1	3I	it could - it 's could go in -
1	6B	cute kittens and puppies , and you know like -
2	3I	well , axes um -
1	3I	i 'm picturing outdoor electric heaters . i do n't know why . it 's not specify .
1	3I	so , large cups could go -
0	6B	stray cat spaying , community news ads , food bank -
1	3I	gas powered cook stoves how about next to the electric heaters ?
1	3I	large cups . okay . yeah uh
1	6B	okay . and no sugar .
1	6B	what is trunc trunc
2	3I	that would go ! right with the oatmeal and the cake mix . okay . what do we got ?
1	3I	right maybe toward the end of the aisle .
1	3I	you bet . we 're gon na build something yet .
2	3I	yeah good like bottles of juice and whiskey right next to one another .
1	6B	um - hospitals and home . and home . yeah .
1	3I	sounds good . got some chocolate bars .
1	6B	yeah . job training programs . mm-hm . chicken pox vaccinations . mm-hm . invasive -
1	3I	makes sense .
1	3I	makes sense .
1	3I	makes sense .
1	3I	makes sense .
1	6B	makes sense .
1	6B	in the whole list , so definitely need to -
1	6B	i - i would trunc
1	3I	um . yeah . uh - it 's hardware .
2	6B	we 're making cuts , so i think that that 's okay .
2	3I	actually , it 'd be more - would n't it - trunc trunc trunc we had another section here of -
0	6B	stray cat spaying
1	3I	it 's up to you . it 's up to you .
0	6B	the um - yeah - uh -
2	6B	cracks me up .
0	3I	an -
1	6B	yeah . yeah , i think so .
2	3I	our unhealthy stuff is , like , kind of in this area . maybe we should just stick it across from the sugar ?
2	3I	yep . yep . totally .
1	3I	paper , miscellaneous , other things ?
2	6B	i would say that 's important too okay , so those two are keepers speech therapy -
2	3I	okay ! um , cushions for deck chairs .
0	6B	okay , so the things we 're cutting are sugar free juice machines -
0	3I	precut wood .
0	3I	pre-cut wood .
0	3I	pre-cut wood .
0	3I	pre-cut wood ?
0	3I	pre-cut wood .
0	3I	pre-cut wood .
0	3I	pre-cut wood .
0	3I	pre-cut wood .
1	6B	trunc trunc i ' trunc maybe we should think that way cuz it seems like a luxury type of thing . but , like , yeah i guess -
0	3I	alright . so , i 've got some scissors next . trunc a nice shipment of scissors here .
1	6B	cut that and keep the soccer league ?
2	6B	yeah , we can make that - uh , weeds are trunc invasive species . let 's consider it that . prenatal check-ups . yeah . neighborhood watch -
1	3I	bottles of juice . yeah
2	6B	i guess - let 's - we could - i mean that we could cut the kitten and puppy adoption . i - to me i would think that would be -
2	3I	this is not much of a food store , is it ?
2	3I	well , these are the utilities .
0	6B	ah , yeah .
2	6B	i - well , i did n't get a chicken pox vaccination . i think a lot of kids just naturally get chicken pox and then they 're fine .
1	6B	and that - at this point -
3	6B	well actually -
1	3I	oh ! let 's go the other side . yeah . yeah . trunc bakery 's over there . we 'll - we 'll
1	6B	kitten and puppy adoption , do you think the hospital would have - ?
2	6B	no , i 'd r-
0	6B	uh , i think we discussed everything under public , uh , services .
1	3I	yeah . with the -
2	6B	that's-
0	3I	hm , we do n't really have any other fresh produce .
0	6B	or flagpole repair , or taxi stops , or fishing licenses .
1	3I	bars of soap . yep .
2	3I	i mean it 's not trunc it 's not - i would n't organize a store this way , but we 're sorta stuck .
2	6B	then definitely .
2	3I	whatever , we 're doing it .
1	3I	well , let 's ma a new - new area . pet food , toys -
2	3I	oh trunc well , we 're gon na move it a little then broke the rules ! trunc dried figs ?
0	6B	the tattoo , the boating -
2	3I	by the bagels ?
1	3I	or somewhere up -
1	6B	kay , let 's go back up - let 's go to the top of the list , so just one more .
1	3I	trunc right up there , yeah .
2	3I	i think definitely somewhere over here .
1	3I	and then scissors , presumably where the paper and books are .
0	3I	and your mousetraps .
3	6B	i was just gon na say the sugar-free juice machine ! yeah , you could - they do n't need juice , you could just drink water . that 's what i would cut too . um -
1	6B	uh , bagels . that 's two .
2	6B	would also have enough land -
2	3I	i think it 's a mighty fine - i mean for what we had to start with , right ? trunc i mean i would never have put the mouse traps there . i 'm just
0	6B	okay , bookkeeping class-
2	3I	shoelaces , i 'm gon na put with that kinda stuff .
1	6B	probably . i dunno -
1	6B	yeah . they 're important -
2	3I	got some heavy cable next . that sounds pretty utility-ish .
1	3I	well , it looks like we 're -
0	6B	okay , public health and safety .
2	3I	socks . well , we know where that trunc that goes with shoelaces .
1	6B	so , we just wan na start at math tutors ?
2	3I	sure . i trunc and i 'm gon na put this rolls of duct tape with the -
0	3I	box knives ? um -
1	6B	vital life assistance like soup kitchens and housing assistance , and -
2	3I	where are - eh . i think we ended up using all of our - above toys , yeah .
1	3I	other travel and sporting gear ?
0	3I	that trunc okay . wetsuits .
1	6B	uh job training ?
0	6B	i 'm not sure , but i should know because i work in healthcare i 'm sure it 's something about syringes .
2	3I	half inch tubing . okay . with this - crap . siding .
1	3I	oh , trunc trunc trunc true .
2	3I	alright , let 's do all four ! go crazy .
1	3I	could go with tweeze-
1	6B	eh . it 's - i - i do n't care . yeah . not un-
2	6B	should be revenue .
2	6B	it does help with social behavior .
2	3I	um , light jackets , aha ! i knew i saved a space for something ! and -
1	6B	well , cooking classes i suppose -
2	3I	you use like lighters for that . we - you - you only use matches for like candles . at least my family does .
0	3I	uh , we 're done !
2	3I	bundles of sticks . oh , there was wood . yeah .
2	6B	i 'm not a big fan of tattoos .
2	3I	i would put it here , but that 's just me .
1	3I	where do we want the clothes ?
1	6B	yeah , what else would you cut ?
1	6B	like , service groups that trunc would be willing to increase their funding of it .
0	3I	grooming trunc ah !
1	6B	i think we - we made our decision about it .
0	6B	i dunno . trunc people hafta - people who enforce it , people who write the code behind it , people who -
1	3I	and our favorite , wetsuits .
2	6B	that 's right . i agree with that .
1	6B	okay , so we got one .
0	6B	kno-
3	6B	or at least stop funding them .
0	3I	um , books .
2	6B	no , keeping that . um .
1	6B	well , maybe it should be w-
1	3I	okay . alright . just pull one out .
1	3I	trunc did we say outdoors were in aisle one ?
1	6B	hhh ! it 's possible to leave - mean we got sex ed on the education .
2	3I	we have - we have room here . why do n't we just start sort of a catch all category here ?
0	6B	junior league soccer .
1	6B	job training programs sounds important .
2	6B	dear . this is the one that 's hard .
2	6B	what about weed control ? maybe - maybe those are the two that we can cut .
2	3I	cuz she trunc they did n't say that we had to do it in any order . i would say maybe start with the food items . trunc that seems to trunc make more sense , because these are hard , i do n't know where these are gon na go .
2	3I	egg timers ! hm , possibly with the eggs ?
1	6B	we 'll start with those two .
2	6B	we 'll just say that .
1	3I	wetsuits , yeah , that 's , like , sport stuff . bottles of juice , that 'd go - that 's easy , that 's - goes where -
2	6B	right , but why could n't the dog catcher take them to the humane society ?
2	6B	a hospital addition can wait .
1	3I	and backpacks . travel guides ? maybe ? by the travel stuff ?
1	3I	yeah . and fishing net really should be up a little by -
0	6B	veterans medical assistance weed control , pre-natal checkups , and neighborhood watch support .
1	6B	but if we keep -
1	3I	paper . i mean if you 're gon na start a or you could have it up here to have personal .
2	6B	me neither .
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs .
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs .
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs .
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs .
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs .
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs .
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs .
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs .
2	6B	no trunc i trunc do you think that 's it ?
0	6B	football .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	6B	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	6B	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	6B	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	i would too .
1	3I	sure , let 's camping area .
1	3I	this is , like , the warm stuff .
0	3I	fifty dollars every day . my mom said to pick the very best one and you are it !
2	6B	humans above - pets any day .
2	6B	the funding from trunc reproductive education that is n't completely cut will be funneled into that .
1	6B	alright , well , i think we 're done then .
1	6B	yeah . uh , so we just need to pick one more .
1	3I	so much the same area , is n't it ?
2	3I	next to toilet paper ?
2	6B	all of which are moderately interesting . i mean the seattle channel is actually brilliant .
1	6B	so maybe that could go .
2	6B	yeah , i think that 's kind of just , like , being like , this what 's going on our community . and then nobody ever reads them and they just kinda sit there .
0	3I	um fish hooks .
2	3I	oh , and it 's a -
1	6B	add back custodians , add back -
1	6B	if you could possibly swing it .
2	3I	so those go together .
2	6B	i mean , if you got ta eliminate something , eliminate trunc
1	3I	yeah , maybe here ? okay .
2	6B	pothole maintenance , absolutely have to have .
1	6B	uh , we figured we should keep all that .
1	3I	household supplies . yeah .
1	3I	so it could go , maybe in this area , or by the boating supplies and fishing net ?
2	6B	i mean . oh . oh ! well , then how do you study your notes ? if someone 's taking them for - yeah , but -
1	6B	um , properties .
1	3I	yeah , let 's just do that later . chocolate !
1	3I	oh kay .
1	6B	yeah . see - see how things go . maybe next year we can vote on it
2	6B	so i - i think -
1	6B	i think all those are legit .
1	6B	i do - i do it . i do it on a volunteer basis myself .
1	6B	uh i 'd axe it maybe .
1	3I	um . down . yeah , i think so .
1	3I	oh . where do the - where should that go ?
1	3I	i guess it looks pretty good .
1	3I	sticks of butter , near eggs ?
1	6B	juice machines .
1	3I	so now it 's just kind of like -
0	3I	bottle -
1	3I	yeah , probably in this area .
2	6B	speech therapy is trunc um -
0	3I	we have n't -
1	6B	like maybe - maybe adoption or something like that .
2	6B	that 's not as local .
1	6B	those kinda seem like you could hit -
1	3I	but it could also be some sort of -
1	3I	with the boating supplies ? oh that 's - that would be -
1	6B	okay , so there 's our one thing right ?
2	6B	the cable company 's required to pay for that by law !
1	3I	uh , well we have packages of cookies and bagels right here , so my inclination would be to -
2	3I	because otherwise we 're - without moving things -
0	3I	beets . alright . so -
2	3I	oh next - right here . yeah .
0	6B	just , like , gardening and stuff , right ?
1	3I	and paper bags would go -
0	6B	yeah , we - yeah , we -
1	3I	breakfast .
1	3I	okay . so scissors , how bout by toilet paper ?
0	6B	but i 'm not quite sure , so -
2	6B	yeah . gone .
0	3I	clockwise or counter-clockwise , i 'm trying to picture what i would do , cuz it -
1	3I	we had boots and stuff , too , and they 're gon na probably end up in there .
1	3I	oh , yeah . so maybe the -
1	3I	close to paper bags ?
2	6B	and it 's so sad when they all have to get put down . i 'm such a cat person , i ca n't do that .
2	3I	would be over with the boating supplies .
2	6B	it just - i - it - it just sucks not having the same kind of -
1	3I	or - cause is would go with trunc maybe we should put a separate -
2	6B	yeah , so let 's take weed control out of public health and safety , and leave the invasive species removal . um -
1	3I	bundles - bundles of sticks , that sounds like fire lighting to me . i ca n't think of anything anyone would use bundles of sticks for at this time of the season .
2	6B	uh , the junior soccer league , and the boys basketball club .
3	3I	trunc no but we trunc we 're deciding right now . i mean , they 've already started moving things in -
2	6B	well - flag pole repair bye .
1	3I	i think we could . we have some extra room there .
0	3I	gas powered cook stoves where did we put electric heaters again ?
1	3I	outdoor stuff . gadgets ? like scissors ?
1	6B	just because -
1	3I	here . we can do a transition with backpacks and toys .
1	3I	over in the -
1	6B	i feel like -
1	6B	i 'd say poetry books .
1	3I	i think here .
2	3I	yeah , it 's debatable .
1	6B	i would say also not as important .
2	3I	i do n't think we have anything else pet-related .
1	3I	rolls of duct tape . i spose -
1	3I	okay , next to boating supplies .
1	3I	i 'd put that probably with the clothing .
2	3I	put it with the small axes . yeah . we do n't carry any large weapons .
3	3I	i mean we 're running - i mean there must be four miles between these aisles , but we 're running back and forth putting trunc up signs where they 're supposed to be , right ? okay .
1	3I	by the trunc axes , okay .
1	3I	it does n't really matter .
1	3I	we do n't seem to have cleaning supplies .
2	6B	oh . there are three or four really interesting -
1	3I	let 's - let 's go up from cushions for deck chairs .
1	6B	let 's go ahead and keep the adoption .
1	3I	um , maybe below .
2	6B	i know . can we maybe - ? i do n't - i just - like - i feel like , especially -
1	3I	i 'll put it there .
1	6B	can be fewer and farther between .
1	6B	yeah , i mean they 're great to have , but if you 're on a budget cut thing you probably would have to .
1	6B	you know it 's -
2	6B	that being said there are still a ton of people who watch it . um .
0	3I	uh beverages ? hm , not - not yet .
0	6B	mm-kay . math tutors .
2	6B	yeah , let 's pass on that .
2	6B	oh no ! wait . trunc um -
2	6B	yeah , depend on the need in the - in the community .
1	3I	food and -
2	3I	yeah , let 's put it with the ice cream . i think .
2	6B	that 's what they 're thinking .
1	6B	that 's up for debate . okay . we 'll put a check next to that one .
2	3I	there we go , let 's do that . so right underneath the toilet paper . alright . so next uh bottles of juice .
2	6B	vaccinations , absolutely .
2	6B	i 'm - hunting tags outta here -
2	3I	accessory type items . socks , fleece lined boots .
1	3I	with empty jugs ?
1	6B	i mean , it 'd be - it 'd be almost better to just have more like , spaying .
0	6B	that way -
1	6B	okay . and so -
1	3I	yeah , i guess so .
1	3I	yeah . i guess so .
1	3I	you think those two by the -
2	6B	i mean , for which city is this for ? for seattle , there 's a lot of -
2	6B	so many cats , yeah . they were cute , but i was like - trunc
1	6B	uh , boating licenses . that 's - trunc trunc ?
1	6B	and the other question is what - what do we - as you said , what do we think either the community will rally to support regardless or a - is - is easily privatized without -
1	6B	okay needle exchange ?
1	6B	so , how are we gon na go about this ?
1	3I	this is a good store so , okay .
0	3I	i trunc we do n't really have any other fresh - yeah . i guess with -
2	3I	let 's see , those are probably good - miscellaneous stuff cause we already used up the boating area . so those 'll be right above mouse traps and paper bags .
1	6B	food bank we need .
1	3I	i think we have the power to decide .
1	6B	and in - in more suburban settings that are maybe unincorporated king county , for example if it was at a hotel , the probably have place right on the hotel grounds .
0	3I	i do n't know . let 's see , oatmeal -
2	3I	by the outdoor stuff .
2	3I	and then gadgets .
1	3I	tweezers and - those are -
2	3I	yeah , we do n't really have any .
1	6B	i mean , i just keep thinking we 're only gon na have to get rid of one outta here . and i think taxi stops are it .
2	6B	well job training programs is pretty crucial , so -
2	6B	yeah , it should be .
1	6B	see your public news station trunc public access station is -
1	3I	um , shoes could go by the pet food ?
2	6B	and we 've said every word on these lists . i think we should call valerie in .
2	6B	bagel factory inspections , you probably want to put that off .
2	6B	that 'd be awesome .
1	6B	i think we can keep that .
1	6B	that seems to be something where if someone wants to learn to cook -
1	3I	that goes - um - that 's a new - new kind of item so i -
2	6B	alright , we 're gon na assume it 's king county , and that there are services provided by the city .
0	3I	bottles of juice and loose-leaf paper .
1	3I	maybe with the boating supplies .
2	3I	like next to the deck stuff .
1	3I	true yeah .
1	3I	put trunc the -
0	6B	right . note takers for disability services .
2	6B	yeah . bookkeeping classes probably could go . i do n't think -
1	3I	should we just pick an arbitrary spot ?
1	6B	are not necessary .
1	3I	well , there was paper and scissors that could maybe be grouped with that .
1	6B	but i guess it 's not really -
1	3I	we do n't have any fresh - yeah , soybeans . let 's put it with soybeans for right now .
2	3I	oh you could travel with em or camp with em or wear em as trunc this is the one that i think is interesting , box knives . tsk .
2	6B	but then i 'm concerned about the egg farm regulations because of - so many people eat eggs and if we 're talking about salmonella and stuff .
1	3I	next to these -
1	3I	socks , probably up with shoelaces and boots and so on .
1	3I	oh . yep . school supplies . got ta get them travel trunc guides .
1	3I	maybe here . next to the toilet paper . peas .
2	6B	no , i think -
1	3I	boxes of donuts , next to the bagels .
1	3I	boxes of donuts . next to the bagels .
1	6B	or just go through a list , and then , like , pick based on th-
1	6B	i have the same feeling about that one . it could go , maybe .
1	6B	maybe acting coaches could be cut ?
0	3I	oh , like a box cutter ?
0	6B	flagpole trunc repair .
1	3I	should we put it up here as kind of a category of - ?
2	3I	bagels . i 'm going to put underneath the package of cookies .
2	6B	maybe that needs to be in there .
1	6B	okay , well you never know . um - oh , yeah acting coaches . that 's fine .
1	3I	okay . so now - so let just trunc take the food ?
0	6B	okay , taxi stops .
2	3I	why argue it ?
1	3I	we can some back to that one . beets .
2	6B	you should n't cut them .
1	6B	and veterans medical assistance ?
2	6B	can learn how to do that at home .
1	6B	yeah , let 's keep the special ed . and get rid of speech therapy .
0	3I	um , so i guess the first one we have is -
2	3I	i woulda put it here , but we have siding here .
0	6B	hospital addition .
1	3I	that 's gon na be over here somewhere , right ?
1	3I	sorry , i had to sneeze . that was a strange sound . tow ropes up by the boats , right ?
2	3I	bundles trunc yeah . i think maybe bundles of sticks here .
2	3I	they 're fixed .
0	6B	invasive species removal , s_t_d_ education -
2	3I	books , yeah , we 'll put books down here by themselves .
0	3I	uh . hm .
1	6B	program you need to put into it . um .
1	3I	uh , down here , probably . this is , like toiletries .
1	6B	i woulda suggested the public news station .
2	6B	so let 's just - let 's just hypothesize that there 's a fine -
1	6B	probably - yeah . food bank , that 's important . junior soccer league . i think it 's -
2	6B	this one here .
1	3I	close enough . and half inch tubing -
1	3I	maybe books and -
2	6B	i learned to make a good chocolate cake but uh -
2	6B	oh yeah , i totally did n't even - yeah , i tend to think of just all weeds as , like , bad , but - yeah , there 's invasive species versus - yeah . so we could probably - like , if we had to pick between the two , i 'd - yeah , pick the weed control to go . um -
1	6B	think should stay . the veterinary hospital -
0	6B	weeds . okay .
1	3I	i think that 's either one . as well those are kinda miscellaneous things .
1	3I	like , books of matches and loose-leaf paper ?
1	3I	i think we will .
1	3I	you wan na do , like -
1	3I	maybe with the beets . kind of , those are more fresh maybe items , or - ?
2	6B	the fans ?
1	3I	uh , anywhere in here would make sense to me . maybe down here ?
1	3I	just , like , miscellaneous house stuff ?
0	3I	so , um , i suppose we 're done .
2	6B	we got the pot - tattoo artist licenses , we can get rid of that because you can look at the art on their wall or get recommendations or whatever . you do n't really need a license to do that .
1	6B	it 's good , but it 's not as important as - as these human -
1	6B	i would think .
1	3I	next to paper ?
1	3I	heavy cable . building stuff . yeah , that 's good .
2	3I	well , i just think they need to -
1	3I	but like power cord and heavy cable -
1	6B	you like coke , do you ?
1	6B	um , i agree with you on math tutors .
2	6B	but those - i mean , the flip side is that those allow people to start businesses .
0	6B	poetry books .
0	6B	poetry books .
0	6B	poetry books -
0	6B	poetry books .
1	3I	jugs . maybe in the kitchen-y - yeah , in this kitchen -
1	6B	um yeah .
1	3I	except we do n't have any more clothing items .
2	6B	i think it 's good but - honestly -
0	6B	green seattle , i think it 's called .
1	3I	hm . i suppose . heavy coats .
1	3I	we 'll pretend it 's a travel vest .
0	6B	yeah , was about twenty years ago .
1	3I	okay . okay . um tow ropes i guess i would put with heavy cable , right ?
2	6B	i do n't know . does n't trunc this is for funding , right ?
1	3I	we could put it here . oh -
1	3I	looks fine .
1	3I	i would put that in our random section . maybe .
2	6B	i dunno , we could -
2	3I	yeah i trunc and just - thinking about a real grocery store , i think that 's where they 'd be . cushions for deck chairs . hm .
2	6B	yeah we need to keep funding it until it 's done . because a half done one is n't gon na do anything .
1	3I	yeah , books are made of paper .
1	3I	oh yeah yeah , that makes sense .
1	6B	we can wait til next year .
1	6B	i really wish i knew what kind of a town this is .
1	3I	too heavy to hold paper down on your desk .
2	3I	oops . ca n't touch the mouse traps .
2	6B	i do n't think we have to worry about stray cats , either . like , there 's not that many , like -
1	3I	that makes trunc i think that makes sense
1	6B	medical marijuana law , yeah .
0	6B	and after living on my own , i 've um -
2	3I	okay . so here is our two camping things . backpacks - unless we 're gon na say backpacks are school supplies . in which case they should be near toys and books maybe . and then i think there 's going to be paper in there .
2	3I	large cups ? large cups and pre-cut wood ?
1	3I	this one ?
2	6B	that could trunc be taken away maybe , yeah .
2	6B	reproductive education . i guess that 's outside of the schools , but i think it 's very important .
0	6B	pothole maintenance , subway system , hunting tags , towing services , massage certificates , flagpole repair , taxi stops -
0	6B	the public access .
1	3I	true . we could put it with the toys .
2	6B	well . okay . trunc in king county , if you 're under twenty-one , and um -
2	6B	that 's important . yeah , that 's very important . assistant cooks -
2	6B	children 's has just finished theirs , they do n't need another one .
1	3I	how does that look over - ?
0	6B	pest control - pest control -
1	3I	yes , i 'm sort of - yeah , over there . maybe .
1	3I	small axes by the pre-cut wood ? yeah . okay .
1	3I	around here-ish ?
2	3I	and this is our edibles , obviously , on the right here .
1	3I	would you put it -
1	3I	would you put it -
1	6B	or you can just like start something else cuz there 'll be plenty of funding in everything else .
1	6B	okay , s-
1	3I	cake - somewhere near cake mix , maybe .
2	6B	all the voc ed teachers i know -
1	3I	so that 's kind of household items , maybe ?
1	6B	i mean you 'll have blackberry bushes all over the place .
1	6B	yeah . i 'm thinking the sex ed is more of the younger age , and then reproductive education is once they actually do - they 're pregnant
1	3I	oh . yeah , okay , so coats could go up there . sure .
1	6B	well , it just depends how a big a city you have .
0	3I	okay , let 's see .
1	6B	either we - well either we - either we need to -
1	3I	or by the pet food ?
1	3I	yep . yep .
1	3I	yep , yep .
1	3I	think . huh ? yeah .
1	3I	they can just -
1	3I	gah ! maybe by socks .
2	3I	on - no . no
2	6B	they 're not usually -
1	6B	that seems like , if you wan-
2	6B	yeah . unless - yeah . maybe they wanted to cut everything . but that 's not gon na happen .
1	3I	yeah , it could just be miscellaneous , i guess .
0	6B	it 's , like , if you have a community newsletter .
1	3I	okay . i have cookies .
2	6B	so , you say -
0	3I	right over here .
1	3I	cushions for deck chairs . we 're back to this stuff .
1	3I	well , why do n't we - ? should we put it right here ?
1	3I	mean uh we have a lotta room down here .
1	3I	tools over here , maybe ?
2	6B	massage certificates , get out .
1	3I	sure . office supplies .
1	3I	maybe with the -
1	3I	over he-
1	3I	yes ! they 're reading - reading trunc items .
1	6B	it probably depends on whether you 're old . i think .
1	6B	that sounds important .
1	6B	that sounds important .
3	6B	right , cuz that - the -
1	3I	the travel guides ? do , like , clothing and , like traveling supplies , maybe ?
1	6B	whew .
2	6B	oh , really ? oh my word .
1	6B	you know what i mean ? so - uh , maybe .
1	3I	somewhere in here ?
1	3I	on the -
1	6B	oh , that 's true , that 's true .
1	6B	oh , that 's true . that 's true .
1	3I	outdoor -
2	6B	people can pull their own weeds . well like what , in like public - places ? you have like -
1	3I	well we got two spots there . maybe we could - yeah .
1	3I	hm , right there .
2	3I	like , soybeans are healthy , sugar is not . so this is , like , the unhealthy half , and this is the healthy half .
2	3I	oh , fish hooks . i - i - that 's easy ! an easy one .
2	6B	sugar-free juice machines . screw em . we do n't need em .
1	3I	and put all of our -
1	6B	well , we could - hm ?
1	6B	i think that 's another thing we could get rid of .
0	6B	vets medical , egg farm , weed control , prenatal .
2	3I	well , you know , you do have in the the far righthand corner , that is a problem for the register .
1	6B	they 're sorta the same .
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing .
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing .
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing .
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing .
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing .
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing .
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing .
1	6B	what about hospital additions though ? you like those bagels , i know , but -
2	6B	yeah . you could , it could be bad if there 's unlicensed tattoo artists around .
0	3I	beats and peas . so we have those beans that are there and we ca n't move them .
2	3I	yeah . so it could be - i do n't want it by siding , much . i 'd rather have it opposite boating .
2	6B	okay . so . i think those are our six .
1	3I	yeah . shoot .
1	3I	five pound weights under a net .
2	3I	yeah , anything - i guess i 'll try to group together things that you could use outside , or like , if you 're doing utility type things , but -
1	6B	from disability services .
2	3I	box knives , yeah same thing .
1	3I	yeah , exactly . i 'll leave a space .
1	6B	maybe we should just pick two .
0	6B	i think that 's , like -
0	3I	we have a whole bathroom section
1	6B	which one were you talking about for that ?
2	3I	okay , unfortunately , that 's trunc the heavy coats belongs here , so let 's move - let 's move this . trunc make a little room .
2	3I	and some small saws . let 's go ahead and put those with the rest of the sharps . right above the small axes .
1	3I	fleece lined - okay we got clothes here . fleece lined boots . where are we gon na put clothes ?
0	6B	and w-
1	6B	are the junior soccer league - ?
1	3I	put it in there . okay .
1	3I	probably there .
1	6B	clerk and you can either get a artist license , you can get a boating license , you can get a -
0	6B	that 's like sex ed , but for adults , right ?
2	6B	subway system we do n't get . whoops !
1	6B	that 's pretty important .
2	3I	well , you could stick it across cuz we have the both , uh - i think we have both sides of the aisle .
0	6B	public news .
2	3I	okay uh , bagels . bagels , right here .
1	3I	fishing net , yeah , kay . there you go !
0	6B	reproductive education , job training programs , chicken pox vaccinations -
0	6B	yeah , i did n't either .
2	3I	but not , perhaps , in the refrigerated section so -
0	3I	i 've got some books of matches which -
3	3I	trunc one of these big stores -
1	3I	or - or - stationary . the stationary section .
2	6B	so i would say no to the weed control . okay , recreation and public services . um -
2	6B	yeah , cut that because you do n't need a campaign . that 's four !
1	6B	can see if there are two . okay .
1	3I	either or .
2	6B	well i guess you should keep that . cuz people use taxis .
1	3I	yeah uh -
1	3I	what would you do with an empty plastic jug ?
3	6B	yeah , it 's - trunc trunc i useta work for the health department , and they had all kinds trunc i mean - yeah .
2	6B	subway system . interesting , since we do n't have one really in seattle . but -
2	6B	i mean , as much as - again i 'm like - you know - the total green -
2	3I	yeah . right . sticks , here we go . yes , i know ! bars of soap . here we go . next to toothpaste , yeah .
0	3I	we got pouches of oatmeal .
2	6B	you need to keep the school clean , so you ca n't cut the custodians .
1	3I	okay um -
2	6B	buy a paper .
1	6B	trunc so we kill one of them and let the other program take up the slack , or - ?
1	3I	oh , i think power cords sounds good .
1	6B	math tutors are pretty important .
0	6B	toxic waste .
1	3I	next to the large vests , or perhaps -
2	6B	hunting tags you have to have .
1	3I	or in - closer toward power cords ?
1	6B	no ! no .
1	6B	no , no .
1	6B	no , no .
1	6B	no . no .
1	6B	no . no .
1	3I	by the cake mix , the eggs , ice cream and sugar ?
0	3I	eeny , meeny , miny , moe . catch a tiger by it 's toe . if he hollers , make it pay .
2	6B	the community news , if we absolutely have to .
1	6B	i guess it depends on what it is , like how harmful it is .
2	3I	it should be against the water because you should have water when you drink whiskey , too . yeah . um , peat moss .
1	6B	i trunc i think that the arts are so often on the chopping block that they probably do n't have any money to fall back on if we cut them . um -
2	6B	got ta keep poetry . got ta keep the arts .
0	6B	is it already existing ? i would assume .
1	3I	okay . well , boating . yeah , that 's cinch-y . loose leaf paper . is going to go by the scissors .
1	6B	right . that 's right , get some efficiency .
1	3I	and bags of peat moss , we need sort of a garden section i guess .
1	3I	i think we did okay .
2	6B	but - i agree with you . i agree with you . no . no . i think you 're right . it 's acting coaches as - let 's interpret it as -
1	6B	way down there . okay , so that 's one we could get rid of .
0	6B	so when it says cutting , like the -
1	6B	the so we 've gotten trunc veteran 's medical out , and egg out on the basis that they 're already covered by the feds .
2	6B	yeah , have to have that . we can can the basketball club .
0	6B	recreation and public service .
0	3I	here we go . yeah .
1	3I	does that mean , like - ?
0	6B	oh . yeah . yeah .
1	3I	yeah , above it .
1	6B	okay , we 'll put it on - we 'll put it on the maybe list .
2	6B	teaching certificates . uh , i think we should have teachers . so . we should probably have that . you said no speed limit signs , that could be cut . trunc trunc why ? just like - yeah , no that - that should be kept probably .
1	3I	tweezers how about next to - this - ?
2	3I	with the trunc with the sugar , and the ice cream , the sweets ? cake mix ?
2	6B	well , so in that case , i think -
1	3I	so , mouse traps , box knives -
2	6B	well - okay , i 'm gon na trunc i 'm gon na back - backtrack . i think tattoo artists should be licensed , because it means that they 're up to standards . public health standards , so i - i will - i 'm gon na trunc back - back - go back on that . i think they should be licensed .
1	6B	we could , uh , roll both stray cat spaying and kitten and puppy adoption into the veterinary hospital .
1	3I	or trunc siding , or -
1	3I	next to magnets ? yeah , i would .
1	3I	yeah trunc trunc that makes sense .
1	3I	well , trunc here - stuff - stuff to drink ?
1	6B	so we 're not gon na expand anything .
2	6B	uh , i do n't know if that 's -
1	6B	i think that should stay , um -
0	3I	we have -
0	6B	we have -
1	6B	so those two things ?
1	3I	nearby , at the end of the aisle -
0	6B	i do n't remember . football , -
2	6B	i mean , people are n't stealing them , are they ?
1	3I	in this area trunc maybe between sugar and cake mix .
1	3I	duct tape , power trunc yeah , that sounds like trunc
1	6B	base number . yeah .
1	6B	special ed teachers , think you need those . cooking classes -
2	6B	people got ta know what - where babies come from . which is about - what it start - you know - in the basic way .
2	3I	will go -
2	3I	that 's a little unkind . visually .
1	3I	inappropriate .
0	3I	um , packages of cookies .
2	6B	no , we cut the additional bus stops .
2	6B	definitely keep trunc stray cat spaying .
1	3I	yeah , either or . it 's kind of an odd one okay .
2	3I	picnic stuff .
3	3I	uh . woops ! sorry . i 'm a bull in a china shop . kay .
2	6B	like - yeah , like , an individualized thing . and so i would n't want to cut like , a drama department . but if it was , like -
2	6B	right right right . that 's why we can cut the assistant cooks .
0	3I	yeah , so we 're all done .
0	3I	okay , empty plastic jugs .
2	6B	overhead spraying and things like that that are n't optimal .
1	6B	- trunc yeah , we keep them .
1	3I	food , yeah , which is good .
1	3I	sure . that sounds good .
2	3I	so we 're gon na have to make a place .
1	6B	i feel that would end badly .
1	3I	yeah , let 's do that .
1	3I	well that worked out .
2	6B	why do we need additional bus stops ? question mark . tattoo artist licenses . yeah boating licenses .
1	6B	cuz i do n't -
2	6B	see , i 'm kinda not for trunc well that 's trunc that 's recreation , okay .
2	3I	i like beats .
1	6B	we 're on the fence on . would you rather have assistant cooks , or math tutors ?
2	6B	no , but this is - we 're pretending that this is a city or something , right ?
0	6B	junior soccer .
0	3I	did we move those ? or were those there ?
2	6B	eh . junior soccer league i 'm a big fan of . just because
1	3I	here ? and then toothpaste .
1	3I	here 's another one .
0	3I	okay . face cream .
2	6B	subway system is important . although that 's , like , way more money than the other things , probably . but - uh -
1	3I	an egg timer . i - i - i 'm actually gon na put the timer over here . kay .
1	6B	money saved .
1	3I	or do you wan na ?
1	3I	same thing .
0	6B	did you just say hospital additions ?
2	6B	has a constituency .
0	3I	um , face cream ?
2	3I	let 's put it next to refrigerator magnets .
0	6B	but i do n't know what acting coaches are .
1	3I	maybe on this side ?
2	6B	as an emergency , what they would do is take a teacher from -
2	3I	see , that 's the problem with having it here and not in a larger area .
1	3I	how bout trunc packages of cookies on top .
1	6B	that 's true . yeah .
1	3I	put this up a little bit .
0	6B	um , taxi stops .
1	3I	books of matches would go -
2	6B	yeah . yeah , i dunno why you would need additional stops , or money for additional stops .
1	3I	all through here , yeah ?
2	3I	we can put it where we want , though . we 're in charge here . so -
2	3I	large cups , kitchen stuff .
0	6B	yeah , i um -
1	3I	trunc well , let 's put it right here .
2	6B	okay . i do n't know about your kids , but my kids spent a lot of time in the public library .
2	6B	that i would n't even think would be on the list why is a boys basketball trunc oh , see , but that could be parks and rec .
0	3I	so , i have pre-cut wood , electric heaters , bars of soap , heavy coats , and box knives again .
2	6B	um . special ed teachers . speech therapy could fall under that . so we could keep the special ed teachers and get rid of speech therapy .
1	3I	since it took a little while . okay . what do we have ?
0	6B	non-essential ?
1	3I	or for domestic - well , we could put it with the other clothing items .
0	3I	but that 's kind of a -
2	6B	it seems to me trunc trunc that one 's a lot more longer term than just taking a cooking class and learning how to feed your own family , so it -
1	3I	we can - hm .
1	6B	okay , so let 's cut four .
1	6B	i think that 's highly likely .
2	3I	i would put it over here , too , probably , in the food .
2	6B	they 're in the library . they 're in the library .
2	3I	we got clothes trunc somewhere . heavy coats , yep .
1	6B	just arbitrarily say -
2	6B	let 's not cut the custodians either .
1	6B	must like hunting -
1	3I	okay , perfect .
1	6B	if we only cut one , we can only cut one from the other ones too .
1	3I	trunc trunc put it across from the chocolate bars .
1	3I	now we 've got siding here .
2	3I	definitely with - yeah .
2	3I	cuz that 's where they usually use those .
1	3I	eggs or some -
1	3I	boating supplies . i guess tow - well -
2	6B	you to have - you need to have special ed teachers . cooking classes , no . right .
1	3I	pre-cut wood goes by bundles of sticks , don'tcha think ?
0	6B	i really do n't know .
1	3I	power cords ? yeah .
2	6B	from the absence sufficient public transit .
1	3I	yeah , yeah . um .
2	6B	so that makes it a lot easier . cuz we can get rid of sugar for juice machines .
1	6B	and the hospital trunc okay . okay . so we 'll do those two .
1	6B	so it looks like we identified at least two things .
0	6B	to that and -
2	6B	i do n't think that 's necessary .
1	3I	mm , probably with our clothes ?
2	6B	so we may as well just cut it .
2	6B	maybe list .
2	3I	where 's regular old trunc ? sugar , cake mix , soybeans , down here . yep .
1	6B	there 's no way to lose .
1	3I	tween bagels and soybeans ?
1	3I	wan na put by the cases of whiskey .
1	6B	yeah , i - i 'd agree with that .
1	6B	towing services , again , people can call triple a_ .
1	3I	okay , wetsuits above tow ropes .
1	3I	yeah , that could go back to back with the boating supplies .
0	3I	summer .
1	3I	gon na - trunc heaters . yeah , outdoors . yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
0	3I	kay , here .
0	6B	and so this one i think we also must have had . um -
1	3I	there maybe ?
1	6B	weed control ? no .
2	6B	that 's the problem here , too .
1	6B	what about the toxic waste disposal ?
2	3I	the toilet paper and the cups and loose leaf paper .
1	3I	i would maybe put that in - on - somewhere in this aisle . because that 's something you might take -
1	6B	nope . that 's -
2	6B	yes let pothole maintenance is necessary .
2	3I	fish trunc next to the fishing net .
1	3I	trunc oh , go ahead . good !
2	6B	i think that 's - with youtube it 's pretty redundant .
2	6B	the other ones were a little bit harder .
1	3I	that 's a good point , too .
1	3I	quaker oatmeal pouches , like -
2	6B	it 's essential .
1	3I	maybe here ? okay .
2	6B	yeah , that i think is extraneous .
0	6B	well , trunc how is that different from assistant cooks ?
1	6B	oh yeah , that 's what it is . it 's rats and - yeah . yeah . okay , we 'll go on to infrastructure and licensing .
1	6B	yeah , bookkeeping classes seems -
1	6B	um . it 's not -
2	3I	with their jackets . books .
1	6B	we already have normal cooks , do n't we ?
1	3I	so that should go -
1	6B	oh my gosh .
2	6B	sex offender database . i think personally it 's pretty broken because people who just like - drunkenly pee in public or moon somebody they get put on there , ruined for the rest of their lives . i think it 's pretty broken .
1	6B	that much .
0	6B	um , is it like for - ?
0	6B	huh yeah huh .
1	3I	appliance - well -
1	6B	i dunno . we 'll -
1	6B	yeah , with - yeah .
1	6B	outlet , and trunc i do n't know . but -
2	3I	maybe we should , like , reserve this area for clothes .
1	3I	would that be better with power cords or siding ?
2	3I	where we got juices here ? yeah , it goes right with it , yeah .
2	3I	okay , that 's a good one . power cords and small saws , how about that ? hardware .
2	6B	that 's right . that 's trunc and the families can , yeah .
0	6B	trunc really ? says bagel ? huh . huh .
2	6B	veterans medical assistance . keep it . yep . yep . yep .
1	6B	they put that - they put aspartame or trunc or those other things in there , right .
0	6B	okay . so are we doing the public access and then leaving the news station ?
1	3I	or here ? or here ?
1	3I	uh , this is -
2	6B	okay . they can go with that , totally .
0	3I	yeah , like a box knife .
2	3I	sugar 's trunc like a main staple .
2	6B	well the sex ed is under education while the reproductive education is under public health .
2	6B	but if it - trunc but trunc be - maybe if we agree that it 's too low then we 'll switch it up .
1	6B	i think , yes .
1	3I	yeah , probably .
1	3I	yeah , probably .
1	6B	animal lovers already , we should probably stick with it .
1	3I	that 's interesting . i 'm not sure where i would put that .
1	3I	do you think it should go next to toilet paper ?
1	3I	can go by boating supplies .
2	6B	now i believe in a public news station .
2	6B	but if it 's like a class , it should n't be offered through the county .
1	6B	oh yeah . specially in bad weather .
0	3I	you know , i discovered that they did myself on a camping trip last week . i did not know they sold them either , bu t apparently they do .
0	3I	paper cup .
2	6B	it 's hard to say , yeah . i mean , and what 's trunc you think of boating licenses you know , wealthy people and whatever but on the other hand that 's what trunc can protect the - the public too .
1	3I	they can go somewhere in that aisle .
1	3I	yeah . heavy coats , put them up here above the travel guides here .
2	6B	theater and drama got it through their schools . they did n't get it -
2	3I	that could be outdoorsy camping or -
2	3I	you think so ? or maybe here ?
1	3I	yeah , almost like it 's an endcap .
2	6B	i mean , neighborhoods can have neighborhood watches .
1	3I	hats , mm , there .
2	3I	see , fish hooks . oh , dang .
1	3I	a fishing weight ?
1	3I	what about eggs ?
1	3I	bathroom stuff .
1	3I	it 's kind of its own thing .
0	6B	on to infrastructure and licensing .
1	6B	yeah . reproductive education . yeah . that - that - yeah that should work for that .
0	3I	i do n't fish , so i do n't know .
1	6B	it 's a hard one .
2	3I	trunc yeah
1	3I	of course you need your five pound weights between your scissors and your duct tape .
1	3I	so , dry foods -
1	6B	yeah , kitten and puppy adoption .
0	6B	last one . alright .
2	6B	okay . i 'm still under public service - you take out the soup kitchen .
1	3I	power cords . and then electric heaters .
1	6B	uh , football equipment , i think that was a - that 's an easy call .
2	6B	cause i mean they 're - pretty similar .
1	6B	too much argument ?
1	6B	i guess , i do n't know what - what that entails . you have to have , it 's public safety .
1	3I	people buy liters of water when they go trunc doors .
1	3I	oh . oh , yeah yeah . yeah yeah , this - this trunc probably on this -
1	6B	go lightrail .
1	6B	and keep the community news .
0	3I	i do n't know . what are we - ?
1	6B	so let 's see if four ends up being a good number for all of them .
2	3I	no , just put it there for now . hats obviously with the clothing .
2	6B	i trunc it 's less important , but it 's also good .
0	6B	kitten and puppy adoption , soup kitchens , housing assistance , dog catcher , boys basketball club , public access station -
1	6B	that 's and easy one for me too . okay . so that 's one .
1	3I	yeah , that works .
1	3I	all the extras . heavy cable . here ? here ?
0	6B	that 's not a pepsi machine .
2	6B	the sex offender database you got ta have .
1	6B	i mean - i guess if we have to - between stray cat spaying and kitten and puppy adoption .
2	6B	bookkeeping . that 's four . and then - acting coaches . that would be my five i guess .
1	6B	we 're done
1	6B	i think the boys basketball club is useful .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks ?
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	backpacks .
1	3I	what if i put them right above pre-cut wood ?
1	3I	small saws , right by the axes .
1	3I	well yeah . but these are basic more ingredients rather than food that 's already prepared so let 's - yeah . let 's - these are kind of basic - basic food items .
1	3I	trunc like -
1	6B	so we can get rid of one here .
0	6B	job training programs . it 's chicken pox vaccinations .
1	3I	sure . that 's fine .
1	3I	what would seem that . so we have a boating supply up there .
1	3I	is that a miscellaneous aisle ?
1	3I	sure , that looks good .
1	6B	cuz i do n't like bagels .
2	3I	mousetraps , yeah .
1	3I	be like , right here , right ? or -
2	6B	this is how i propose we go about it . so -
1	6B	the cooking , you know , helps people know what 's healthy but -
1	3I	mm , yeah , i do n't know .
1	6B	together
1	3I	sounds good . so i 've got some pouches of oatmeal . um . those can probably go in like near the cake mix , maybe .
1	3I	disaster preparedness areas .
1	6B	let 's not do that . yeah , let 's just keep it .
1	6B	keep the trunc keep the soup kitchen .
2	6B	yeah , i trunc uh , trunc
1	6B	who would n't have finished high school without playing football .
2	6B	oh ! yeah , that 's cool .
1	6B	we just need to drop one yeah .
2	3I	if we had camouflage gear that would go over - yeah . okay . socks ?
1	6B	we have to buy them in the first place , but -
2	3I	oh yeah . that 's good .
1	3I	next to cake mix or chocolate bars yeah .
2	3I	trunc well , this is foods of all kinds , so far . except for pet food .
1	6B	but i mean , they need em . but it should n't be very costly . you are n't going to be saving very much with a trunc getting rid of the taxi stops .
2	6B	cut the adoption , the soup kitchens -
2	6B	this is hard .
2	6B	well , that 's -
2	6B	well , but that in some ways - but they almost always require matching money i think .
1	3I	mm-hm yep . that 's where i woulda put it . woops ! oh , that 's okay ! that 's okay . clean up , right . that 's appropriate for what we 're doing .
2	6B	i think we need football equipment .
1	3I	could we sneak that between the canvas bags and heavy cable ?
1	3I	that is - it 's a weird thing .
2	6B	so that could be kind of a good think . i think .
1	6B	i hate - i hate to do that but i -
1	3I	four more . yeah .
1	6B	and we were worried - and i was -
2	3I	yes , perfect .
1	6B	spaying trunc we 're cutting the food bank .
1	6B	i thought that was federal .
1	3I	canned foods . um , i 'll put that -
0	6B	i did n't - hm -
1	6B	which gets a little complicated because i think -
1	6B	on that principle that - we know there is at least one other provider .
2	6B	okay , so potentially two .
1	3I	work out stuff , which -
2	6B	well i do n't see cooks on there .
2	6B	that 's not like super important .
1	3I	sounds good . i 've got some shoe laces next . so i pulled those out of a random box . um . those -
1	3I	maybe there ?
1	3I	uh . it 's kinda this whole sort of - i think - you think ? mm-kay .
2	6B	they had from last year , ca n't they ?
1	3I	small axes , small saws .
1	6B	poetry books . well , a few of those should be -
1	3I	alright . i 'll put it next to the , uh - the trunc large cups , so we have a small houseware section .
1	6B	do n't have to try to get people to vote for us or anything .
2	6B	yeah yeah , we have to have those .
3	3I	know that we ca n't use that same logic , cuz we 're gon na - we got different placements up here . so what makes sense for this arrangement ?
1	3I	oh , do we want that next to the eggs or in , like , the random section ?
1	3I	pat uses it for like trunc some little fishing things . so - he also uses it for scientific stuff but , um -
1	6B	community news ads ? like , does that mean like it 's like it 's advertising things like happening in the community ? cuz then that could be cool to keep . but if it 's like advertising like -
2	6B	course , you could do what mcdonald 's did . mcdonald 's got caught putting too much wood pulp in their hamburger buns in iowa .
1	6B	so it sounds like -
1	3I	we 'll have different types of , like trunc i 'm assuming we 'll have the juice and -
0	6B	yeah , yeah . same .
2	3I	oh , it 's a wetsuit , though .
1	3I	alright . fish hooks with fish nets .
1	3I	now we have choices . so -
1	3I	and we 're putting clothing over here , right ? do we want light jackets maybe here ?
1	3I	mm - mm-kay .
2	6B	right . trunc it 's not the m-
1	3I	no so trunc okay !
1	3I	so , you want face cream next ?
1	3I	i think . travel guides .
2	6B	or they could be someone who 's like ,
1	3I	what else would be pet-related ?
2	6B	well that 's why i think we left -
2	6B	yeah , so for my case , i 'd probably - is n't it more serious as an adult , if - ?
2	3I	okay . so trunc maybe we could put it next to toys ! i mean , those trunc trunc they 're for entertainment . so let 's do that .
1	3I	unless y-
0	3I	what do you have ?
0	3I	what do you have ?
2	3I	i 'd put it with the tools .
0	3I	trunc ah , here we go .
1	3I	you could put it here , i think , maybe .
2	3I	i will put that over with there .
1	3I	the other stuff you drink .
1	6B	it 's an important . yeah .
1	6B	uh , i think it 's a decent set of skills . and music - uh , music to me is -
0	3I	um , empty plastic jugs .
0	3I	yeah , uh , tweezers i had with that .
0	3I	and books .
0	6B	yeah , we got it .
1	3I	that 's a good idea .
2	3I	yeah it trunc yeah , actually it would , because that 's where you find shoe polish , also .
1	3I	yeah trunc yep . trunc by small saws .
1	3I	cutting , and kitchen things on fire implements .
0	6B	job training trunc oh - chicken pox vaccinations , invasive species -
1	3I	i know i know .
1	3I	yeah . that 's totally right .
1	6B	yeah , trunc me neither .
2	6B	i think we 'll go through a list and be , like , this is how many useless things we found , and then we 'll cut that same number .
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs , boating supplies , five pound weights , wet suits , tow ropes , half-inch tubing , books of matches , power cords , heavy cable , empty plastics - that makes sense .
1	6B	and then - basketball ? do we want that as well as soccer ?
0	3I	half-inch tubing . is this , like , for - ?
0	3I	that 's like packing lunches , right ?
2	3I	yeah . cuz trunc the baking - baking supplies should all be together . in a real grocery store they would be . okay um bagels .
0	6B	what about that private jewish school that you went to ?
0	6B	egg farm regulations .
1	6B	yeah . i did n't know they had that one .
1	6B	mh-hm .
2	6B	it 's - public health .
0	3I	cups . when did - i saw -
1	3I	yeah . if - yeah .
0	6B	there has to be one thing to go .
0	3I	so maybe we put it -
1	3I	bundles of sticks . so that 's easy . that 's - could go -
1	6B	also . yeah , things can flood .
0	6B	so we 're cutting like -
1	3I	i 'll trunc let 's see -
2	3I	what if we give it a - a little bit of space , and put the heavy cable here ?
1	3I	with the soybeans . kay .
1	3I	i have bottles of juice . i would suggest putting them next to the eggs in the refrigerated section . alright .
0	3I	well , we 're looking at things that you do n't -
2	3I	right , or should they go next to cake mix ?
1	3I	yep , fish hooks .
1	3I	for um , maybe for an anchor ?
1	3I	right there ?
1	3I	right there ?
1	3I	right there .
1	3I	right there .
1	3I	i 'll just stick that right there . yep ! .
1	3I	sure . i do n't know . yeah , that makes sense .
2	3I	or for house cleaning .
1	6B	that 's funny .
1	3I	that 's funny .
0	6B	trunc walnut -
0	3I	uh , where are those ? um -
1	3I	i think it should go with , uh -
0	3I	you wan na put it with the boating items ? okay .
2	6B	well , here 's - the reason that -
1	3I	yeah , i think we -
1	3I	that works .
1	3I	that works .
1	3I	that works .
2	3I	this is the best we have .
1	3I	and duct tape ? maybe -
0	6B	yeah , public health and safety .
1	3I	oh , kay . we 'll leave it .
0	6B	um . invasive species removal .
1	3I	so should we put that in this group ?
1	3I	a travel hat !
1	3I	a travel hat .
0	3I	all paper bags . yeah .
2	6B	yeah . football stadium . that should be - i think that should be done privately too , personally .
1	6B	massage certificates is probably a - might - massage - if they mean massage licensing -
1	3I	well , once we place it . so what else we got ?
2	6B	it could fall under sex ed .
1	6B	and then , what 's the next least important one ?
1	3I	here . cups .
2	3I	um , bags of peat moss , um , i 'd say that probably gon na go where - like , where pet food 's gon na go . maybe just , like , garage , storage .
1	6B	not , you know , unequally unhappy .
2	3I	yeah , yeah , that would be good . that would work .
0	3I	when you buy beets , are they usually fresh , or - ?
1	6B	yeah . wan na say three ?
1	6B	do you think it 's important ?
2	3I	yeah . oh , okay !
1	6B	is it essential ? um , and - and - will in fact the community not step up to provide ?
2	6B	not as important . um . it 's still - it 's still a big issue . um .
1	3I	next to backpacks , or - ?
1	3I	i think - well , i mean when i think about small saws and trunc you know doing yard word and doing - doing repairs and that sort of thing .
1	6B	trunc yeah . trunc trunc and all kinds of people cam come in and do all kinds of things of varying worth
0	6B	where are like - okay , if it 's education and programs so then we 're talking about like -
0	3I	cushions .
2	3I	oh ! we did n't do the eggs . ah . okay . good point . mm-hm .
2	6B	then you 're gon na have - yeah , then they 're gon na be out there yelling atcha .
2	3I	uh . ugh .
2	6B	nah that would n't be a public service .
1	6B	how bout , what do you think for the other one ?
1	3I	maybe . maybe near the travel guides ?
2	3I	alright . i 've got some empty plastic jugs . which are fairly utilitarian but still trunc somewhat miscellaneous .
1	3I	we could put it right up - uh , right afterwards .
0	6B	yeah , me neither .
0	6B	okay , well we 've got three so far from this group .
2	3I	there we go . it 's on the end of the trunc right .
0	3I	gas-powered cookstoves .
0	3I	gas-powered cookstoves .
0	6B	is there anything we missed ?
1	3I	and then - would - these kinda things be - ?
2	3I	sounds good to me i think we have an empty box .
1	6B	yeah . it 's pretty necessary for access .
2	3I	next to the mousetraps . beets .
1	3I	perhaps with the siding ?
1	3I	so , what i 'm thinking is -
0	3I	i have some cases of whisky . cases . of whisky .
1	6B	that 's interesting . okay . yeah . yeah . okay . we 've got - we 've got three . yeah . we did it .
1	6B	i would say , like , between prenatal and reproductive , one of the two .
1	6B	probably .
1	6B	probably .
1	6B	probably -
1	6B	probably .
1	3I	probably .
1	3I	probably .
1	3I	probably .
1	6B	probably .
1	3I	trunc next to cake mix , yeah .
1	3I	be in this one here .
1	6B	okay , so we 'll keep -
1	3I	yeah , where are they ?
1	3I	over here ? okay .
2	3I	yeah . it looks - looks good . okay , sticks of butter . okay . definitely food .
0	3I	so let 's see
0	3I	so these are already baked .
1	6B	okay , yeah - yeah . yep .
1	6B	yeah this is .
0	6B	okay . now .
0	3I	okay , now -
2	6B	in public health and safety , there 's the reproductive education , and the s_t_d_ education .
1	6B	drainage ditches . yeah , we live in high-rain area that 'd be bad if they did n't work right .
1	6B	well , you got ta pay for that .
0	3I	welcome to seattle magnets or - you know the - industrial -
1	3I	um , beets . well , beets are a fresh produce item , and we do n't have a fresh produce aisle yet .
1	6B	well , let 's do infrastructure and licensing , and i say take out tattoo artist licenses .
1	6B	hunting tags ? yes . towing services ? i guess yes . massage certificates ? maybe not ?
0	3I	um , heavy cable .
0	3I	um , heavy cable .
1	3I	and then there 's your boating fishnets .
2	3I	yeah , there 's a fishing section then trunc then you get the power cords
0	3I	bottles of juice .
0	3I	bottles of juice .
0	3I	bottles of juice .
0	3I	bottles of juice .
0	3I	bottles of juice .
0	3I	bottles of juice .
0	3I	bottles of juice .
0	3I	bottles of juice .
0	3I	bottles of juice .
0	3I	bottles of juice .
0	3I	bottles of juice .
2	6B	i can definitely part with the tattoo artist licenses .
1	3I	i think next to the wood .
2	6B	yeah , i would say , cuz i personally did n't have a vaccination because -
1	3I	cuz it 's fall , and -
2	6B	chicken pox vaccinations are pretty important .
1	3I	it 's kind of a food thing though , right ?
1	3I	either . either spot i think is probably fine .
1	3I	we can make this store however we want it , right ?
2	6B	that 's one thing i 'm thinking -
1	3I	oh . it 's the aisle , right ? so -
2	6B	let 's go ahead and axe those . no more sugar free juice machines .
1	3I	okay . i think we 're done !
2	6B	or does it need the hospital for the spaying and the -
1	6B	could probably -
1	6B	yeah , let 's - and then why do n't we read through , like , the whole list -
1	3I	this gets more into that kind of , um -
2	3I	yeah it could go - actually , it could go in - in any of those .
2	3I	and shoelaces go with - where 's the trunc place where - there they are .
1	6B	i personally think those could get cut .
2	6B	oh , wait a minute .
0	3I	five-pound weights .
0	3I	five-pound weights .
0	3I	five-pound weights .
0	3I	five-pound weights -
1	3I	traveling .
0	3I	we got - we got empty plastic jugs .
1	3I	in that sort of area although i guess we have - so , i guess we would populate both sides of that , so we would still have that side all empty .
1	6B	mm-hm . then it 's important . yeah .
1	6B	sugar free , to me , is almost as evil as -
1	6B	they 're not cutting the girls , they 're just cutting the boys and i do n't think they sh-
1	3I	small axes . so , they could go down here by -
1	6B	alright , you can take that one out .
0	6B	to whom may you have spread this disease ?
0	3I	trunc whiskey .
1	3I	maybe into -
1	3I	uh . yeah . canvas bags .
1	3I	or pet food , going up ? i do n't -
1	6B	okay . um . or maybe lump it under pest control ?
2	3I	bags of peat moss , that 's kind of outdoor .
1	3I	um across from ice cream , obviously - no . uh -
1	3I	trunc we should put chocolate on the end of the ai- .
1	3I	right there . how about trunc face cream , whoever uses face cream ?
2	3I	i 'm trunc no trunc it 's a toiletry thing , it 's for plucking your eyebrows . is n't that funny ?
2	3I	but that 's frozen and this is n't , so i guess we can put this here ?
1	6B	maybe we 're supposed to discuss each item . we did n't discuss each item in absolute detail like we did over there . i mean - you know , there were things -
1	6B	yeah . boys basketball . and either stray cat spaying or community news ads ?
0	6B	yeah , okay . so , infrastructure and licensing , teaching certificates -
2	6B	in - in our trunc in our fictional town , i think it runs great . but we could use additional -
2	3I	right across from shoelaces . maybe up one . just in case we find boots to put there .
2	6B	those are also -
1	6B	with the public health and safety .
0	6B	what are you gon na say ?
1	3I	what were you thinking ?
0	6B	that 's four ! okay , veterinary hospital , pest control -
0	6B	chicken pox vaccinations .
1	3I	pouches of oatmeal , okay , that would be dried - dried things . trunc maybe with the -
1	3I	oh , yeah , that 's right . we have to contend with that too .
1	3I	they could 've - they could 've gone -
1	3I	dried figs . i suppose here .
1	3I	other bundles of trunc ticks and wood
0	6B	hm . alright .
2	6B	but it does require some public money to coordinate it .
0	6B	one , two and three .
1	3I	buckets , maybe with the items we 'd put in the garage ? by the small axes and -
1	3I	tweezers , yeah .
0	3I	okay . hi .
1	6B	there was one more i think .
1	3I	we could put like -
1	3I	dried figs ? or , does trunc those do n't have to be refrigerated , no , they 're -
1	3I	we 'll allow -
1	6B	the speed limit signs are important .
0	6B	i wonder how much money we 're saving the county ?
0	6B	okay . over to recreation public services . what we got ? we got stray cat spaying , public news station , food bank , junior soccer league , kitten puppy adoption , soup kitchens , housing assistance , dog catcher -
0	6B	uh , sugar free -
1	3I	that would make sense .
1	3I	okay . uh , let 's take two or three and work - work a group .
0	3I	trunc that -
2	3I	but we have the shoes and shoelaces over here .
1	6B	let 's keep trunc sex ed .
1	3I	this is true . this is true .
2	6B	course , you know , that comes right down - that comes right down to the root thing , is , you know , why do we spend so much money on certain things and not enough money on things that really matter , like education
1	6B	yeah . i think that 's good , though , because if we hafta cut the same from every category -
0	3I	figs . there trunc there - there was -
2	6B	until they have boys and girls . okay . good . yeah . public access station is the same idea as what i was talking about . so , one of those . public news station and public access station . that 's - that , that was called public access tv . let 's get rid of that . yeah . yeah . yeah .
2	6B	so that 's a source of income . so let 's keep that .
2	6B	cuz they 'll just breed more stray cats .
3	6B	football equipment , you 're getting into my political turf there . i love football , and i hate football .
2	6B	that 's where we 've gotten all our pets . soup kitchens we need . housing assistance .
1	3I	i would advocate for near the boating supplies .
1	3I	hat and backpack maybe ?
2	3I	yeah , winner . fishing nets . boats .
2	6B	although , yeah . maybe i 'll feel different , if i -
2	6B	well , and i - i do n't know if this is adult education as well , it may be , teaching people who are diabetic to cook in a responsible way . um . we like the music teachers . probably math tutors are pretty good . sex education , i think is critical .
1	3I	yeah , kind of - yeah , right here .
1	3I	small and delicate box knives .
2	3I	these are refrigerated . these are refrigerated .
1	3I	next to soybeans ?
2	3I	so butter goes typically with dairy in a grocery store .
1	6B	worthwhile .
0	6B	okay , so we 're down to three in each category then .
0	6B	okay , in education programs -
1	6B	so we only got two on that one .
1	3I	those guys . hey look e are - we 're at the end .
0	3I	alright here 's three more .
0	6B	i guess it 's like -
1	3I	next to the hats and the jackets ?
1	6B	that 's interesting , because you know what i was thinking about ?
1	3I	this kind of camping ? i mean it 's really - so is this the camping ?
0	3I	and dried figs .
1	6B	we can go back , see what we 're coming up with .
2	6B	why is the city paying for that ?
1	3I	that 's true . that 's a good point .
2	3I	would be with the trunc so it would be the trunc flour and sugar and things like that , right ?
1	6B	i 'm sorta thinking -
1	3I	light jackets , over here ?
1	3I	let 's see . half-inch tubing . makes me think of household projects .
1	6B	why do we need to inspect bagel factories ?
2	6B	cuz you can get students to do that . yeah .
1	3I	same thing . right there , yeah .
0	3I	cook stoves . gas powered . was this outside ? is this an outdoors thing ?
2	6B	seems kind of an odd one , does n't it ? like - maybe that could be a private -
2	3I	trunc put up here .
2	3I	gee !
2	6B	the only thing about tattoo artists is , like -
1	3I	with our garage items .
1	3I	trunc yeah . not as close .
2	3I	trunc i would be inclined to put it with the rest of the hardware , but we trunc that - our aisle - trunc we 'll have to rearrange our -
1	3I	cuz they have em there .
1	3I	we do n't have an personal trunc oh ! well , toilet .
1	3I	mm . maybe right here . i think right above it .
1	6B	fishing licenses ? yes .
2	3I	especially if they 're canned .
1	3I	yeah i - i would -
2	6B	ah , they would - they would -
1	3I	cuz , trunc okay .
1	3I	can we go too high , i do n't know .
1	6B	how do you feel about recreation and public services ?
1	3I	beets we 'll put with the - the good for you stuff .
1	3I	oh , yeah . over there by the - the boat stuff . yeah .
1	3I	yeah . we 'll use it as a placeholder . canvas bags .
1	3I	ah , it has to go over there again i - i would think .
1	3I	oh , fleece lined boots . i think those are clothing with the - i do n't know .
0	3I	so they are right next to the five pound weights .
2	6B	speech therapy , i 'm biased , i think it 's really important .
1	3I	uh-oh . face cream .
0	3I	you want it - ?
2	6B	i guess i just have a - kind of a -
1	3I	what do you think ? next to it , or - ? kay .
1	3I	yeah . well , trunc actually that , you know , sometimes people use that tubing for exercise .
1	6B	we have the invasive species removal .
1	3I	animal -
0	6B	but i do n't know if they still have it .
1	6B	infrastructure .
2	3I	fleece lined boots is kinda clothes , but -
1	6B	uh , we can - sure , let 's kill the basketball club . we can -
1	6B	well i guess theoretically if we already have it , we could cut it , right ?
2	6B	yeah , i 'm kind of - i 'm kind of , um - yeah , i 'm of two minds there , cuz on the one hand , um , more bus stops more congestion and we have huge congestion problems . uh , and that 's uh , so i think maybe -
1	3I	there 's boating supplies up there .
2	3I	or - or-
1	6B	there 's just not , like , an obvious choice . public access - access station .
2	3I	all of r_e_i_ it 's all about which kind of backpack it - it is .
2	6B	i do n't know . trunc sugar-free juice machines does n't seem as important as the other things .
1	3I	so here ?
1	3I	how would you feel about putting them across from the camping gear in case we encounter other exercise equipment ? so we 'll put them -
0	6B	people would not be able to get boating licenses ? or would that just sort of change the process ?
1	6B	i 'm with you . that 's fine .
1	3I	that was a good idea .
0	6B	teaching certificates , speed limit signs , additional bus stops , tattoo artist licenses -
1	3I	yes . is not . yeah .
1	6B	yeah um -
1	6B	yeah um -
0	6B	okay . okay , so we got those two .
1	3I	be the peat moss and - ? okay .
2	3I	i think so . but i would n't mix up -
0	3I	and - we still have whiskey .
1	3I	equipment that people might be looking for they 're doing their patio , right next to the deck chairs .
2	3I	now , this is gas powered cook stoves . now , since i have n't seen any other appliances i would -
0	3I	um , so , books of matches .
1	6B	i 'm all for books . they 're in the library . why would that be - ?
2	6B	yes . okay . that 's five . that 's good .
1	6B	it 's true . it 's true .
0	6B	yeah . although when i started , they did n't have t_b_t_ there yet .
0	6B	um , public news .
2	6B	so i think all those certificates and licenses you have to have .
1	6B	um - sex ed . we 'll keep that ?
2	6B	the towing services would be in that .
2	6B	guess it depends on how much of a concern , like the traffic , and - it 's pretty bad here , so that might be helpful .
1	3I	mm i am - i 'd probably throw it with the cake mix .
1	6B	keep that and drainage ditches . so , i think we had four . trunc yeah , that 's four .
1	6B	or cats .
2	3I	i thought we had a household supplies trunc department started . yeah , that 's where it is , right there !
1	3I	okay , that 's good .
2	3I	well , maybe above the refrigerator magnets ? and large vests , i 'm just gon na keep people in this one . we 're gon na run outta room in there .
0	3I	where 's our household supplies at ?
0	3I	our are -
2	6B	is , uh , i dunno .
1	3I	well that seems like personal effects , and we do n't have clothing on the - on the line yet so we can -
1	6B	they do n't have any .
2	6B	you have to have special ed teachers , i think .
0	6B	kudzu .
1	3I	could be in this section . yeah .
0	6B	like when d_o_t_ -
0	6B	the hunting , the towing -
2	6B	yeah . okay . that 's gone .
2	3I	bundle - by bundles of sticks ?
0	3I	um , fishing net .
0	6B	um . total reclaim , or something like that . it 's on sixth avenue , down there in - at sodo . and , you can take anything in there .
1	3I	and kinda like - the cups and the paper bags and stuff on one - you think ?
2	3I	that 's frozen food . um . that 'll be here , maybe with packages of cookies ?
2	6B	but they can use the equipment -
1	3I	i guess that would go in food .
2	6B	i really wan na keep the toxic waste disposal , though . we got ta keep the public safe from that stuff .
1	3I	that could go any place .
2	6B	weed control you need .
2	3I	cushions for for deck trunc that was n't on our list !
2	3I	juice . there .
1	3I	that could go with the food .
1	3I	i think you 're right .
2	6B	i trunc that one seems -
1	3I	outdoors . yeah , sounds good to me .
1	6B	sad .
2	6B	okay , so we 're cutting one there at least okay . second column um -
1	6B	i think we 're in the ballpark here . i think , um -
1	3I	should hats go here ?
1	6B	vet - veterinary veterinary hospital . yeah .
1	6B	i think - i think those might -
1	6B	as a drama coach ?
0	6B	flags someone for being - you know - parked for -
2	3I	and shoelaces , too ?
0	6B	boy 's um .
1	6B	and , um . i also think that , um -
2	6B	i - i 'd - i 'd think about - uh , let 's go trunc trunc anything else in that trunc first group of six ?
1	6B	okay . trunc so let 's just read all of them . trunc reproductive , job training , chicken pox , invasive species removal , s_t_d_ education , toxic waste disposal -
0	6B	uh - i think so , yeah .
1	3I	and the beans .
1	6B	um , so add back the hunting tags , and maybe add back -
0	6B	football stadium
0	6B	and eggs .
2	6B	you look at this and see , see trunc yeah , and see - and see what the uh - constituency is . i mean , who 's gon na go out and protest about flagpole maintenance ? right ?
0	3I	oh . um -
2	6B	i think we should trunc
0	6B	junior soccer league
2	6B	i happen to believe that we should n't be f-
1	3I	oh , yeah , or shoes tow ropes .
1	6B	yes . and no more kitten and puppy adoption
2	6B	i feel like it 's a development thing . it trunc it rounds out your development .
1	6B	um service programs .
1	3I	let 's do -
0	6B	soup kitchen , housing assistance -
1	3I	and duct tape could be -
0	6B	so , we have , math tutors , assistant cooks , sex ed , custodians , speech therapy , football equipment -
2	6B	okay . yeah . alright .
1	6B	that 's a good point . that 's , um -
0	6B	i wonder if they count things differently ?
1	3I	but water goes with ?
1	6B	mm-hm mm-hm yeah .
1	6B	so we could cut -
1	3I	put it on the other side of egg timers ?
2	3I	yeah . i do n't like safeway .
2	6B	they 're pretty well regulated at this point .
1	6B	yeah . mm-kay .
0	6B	just as a side note , i actually did that my freshman year .
1	6B	tattoo artist license , we want that . boat license . pothole maintenance . we want trunc subway system .
1	6B	but nothing very vital .
2	3I	ah , yeah we should .
1	3I	a place - maybe put it with the - with the clothing items . so with the vests and the sweaters .
1	3I	that all seems like a logical grouping to me , right ?
1	3I	is that okay ?
1	6B	um . i would - i could probably get rid of cooking classes . i have it in high school programs . i mean , we have -
2	3I	trunc we just - we did the best we could , under the circumstances . socks .
1	3I	yeah , i think .
0	6B	reproductive
0	3I	travel guides , siding , mouse traps .
0	6B	i got it when i was little . um - i trunc
0	3I	duct tape .
2	6B	yeah . i got - yeah , that 's a good idea .
1	6B	yeah . trunc trunc what is an assistant cook ? i do n't know .
1	3I	so , maybe here ?
0	3I	not fresh , but packaged .
2	6B	nobody gets bagels .
2	3I	i 'm gon na do fish hooks , five-pound weights .
1	3I	doorsy stuff .
2	3I	that 's how i see - that 's how i see stores .
2	6B	personally i get all my news from the internet .
0	6B	recreation . stray cat spaying .
0	6B	recreation , stray cat spaying -
1	3I	where 's the check-out ?
1	3I	what if we put the backpacks on the other side of the toys , about mid-aisle ?
2	6B	and they 're - just annoying . okay . so no more taxis . fishing licenses go ahead and keep .
2	3I	you know what i mean ? cuz if - if you just walk down , you looked at toys , ran into clothes , pet food , or whether you do -
0	3I	trunc small axes . okay .
1	3I	sticks of butter would be trunc um - that 's with the -
2	3I	yes . sure . next to soybeans . that makes sense .
1	6B	weed control ? i - i do n't think -
1	3I	the tubing is um - that 's - that 's - plumbing stuff , so it 's building .
1	3I	like produce .
2	6B	maybe those would be things , though , that you trunc that you could like , look for churches or um -
1	6B	so we got ta cut two .
1	3I	we have bathroom supplies , that kinda stuff . so that could go here , mm-hm .
2	6B	okay . football equipment . and i can easily remove assistant cooks and sugar free juice machines .
0	3I	i - i - eh .
2	3I	thanks . so , i guess thick sweaters , in the clothing section .
1	3I	right . sounds perfect .
1	3I	right . and who wants bagels with that ?
1	3I	yeah okay .
1	3I	yeah okay .
2	3I	mm , perhaps with the backpacks and other travel supplies ? or else the bundles of sticks , one of the two .
2	6B	right , so a city does n't provide a towing service .
0	3I	um beets ?
1	6B	i mean where would you - ? where would the county put a taxi stop ?
2	6B	okay . i trunc i can live with that . although i 'm willing to defer to football if you 'd rather buy the books . but the football could us five-thousand dollars .
2	3I	yeah but trunc these were - oh !
1	3I	i 'd say -
1	3I	good place for -
1	6B	we got four .
1	6B	that 's required by law to be available , so we got ta keep that .
2	6B	mm , no like if you 're blind or - like there 's this one girl trunc
1	3I	okay , so these cushions for deck chairs are gon na go up here and - and they 're gon na be , like , on the end cap . okay .
1	3I	and travel , yeah .
1	3I	so this 'll probably go together .
1	6B	um , notetakers for disability services . yeah , i 'm pretty sure that 's - yeah . sugar-free juice machines , kicked those out . bookkeeping classes -
1	3I	peat moss - yeah , there you go ! like that .
1	6B	football stadium upkeep , no .
1	6B	i think - yeah .
1	3I	i think , yeah .
1	3I	i think , yeah .
1	6B	to the , um -
1	3I	i 'd put it with the boating supplies , maybe .
2	6B	i - we might have to - we might have to put off hospital additions .
0	3I	see , trunc this large swath ?
1	6B	uh , keep -
1	6B	okay . so that means we can keep one .
2	6B	you can live without out . i dunno . it 's good . well , but like how trunc how do you cut a whole subway system if you have it already ? that does n't make sense . we 're just gon na rip it out of the ground , guys .
2	3I	i 'm gon na put my butter next to the eggs here ?
1	3I	or would it be school supplies ?
0	3I	i have large vests .
1	6B	keeping the food healthy .
1	3I	we could have a , um , we could have - trunc
1	6B	th taxi stops -
1	3I	what ? uh . okay here we go .
1	3I	that 's trunc let 's put it with the boat .
2	6B	sex ed . custodians . well we ca n't cut speech therapy . that 's the only one i know about .
2	3I	how bout if we put it here - ?
1	3I	um , i think it 's either here , or it 's here . what do you think ?
1	3I	shoe laces and then boots .
2	6B	okay , and would n't weed control be trunc part of a invasive - invasive species removal ?
1	3I	mint toothpaste ! okay . - we had , uh , some trunc oh , that 's right here . yeah , right .
2	3I	well that column looks a little weeny .
1	3I	you know , these are -
0	3I	i 've got some packages of cookies .
2	6B	really ? but a coach ?
1	3I	books , maybe when you 're travelling you read books ?
1	6B	and keep the soup k-
1	3I	we have soybeans . let 's put it with - yeah .
1	6B	everybody speeds anyways .
1	3I	uh , electric heaters -
1	6B	i can - i can part with the public access station -
1	3I	maybe it should .
1	6B	maybe pest control cuz , if you have things like rats .
1	3I	underneath it , yeah .
1	6B	maybe taxi stops ?
2	6B	or the county ?
1	3I	yeah yeah right that 's broke the rules .
1	3I	sweets .
1	3I	we can put it wherever we want .
1	3I	maybe next to the shoe area . heavy coats .
0	3I	and you 've got cushions for trunc deck chairs .
2	6B	and then they lose their right to privacy , and all that .
1	3I	well , those could go in a number of different places , but -
2	3I	boat flags maybe . boating supplies .
0	3I	cuz we do n't have landscaping stuff , do we ?
1	6B	for me .
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts
2	3I	so i would n't separate jackets out into boating supplies , cuz it would be w-
1	3I	cushions for deck chair , it should - maybe - maybe under the - ?
1	3I	and there 's not much room above toys you could put books above toys maybe .
1	3I	mm-kay , okay .
1	3I	put it over here ?
1	3I	siding ? yeah , trunc kinda - uh , yeah . that makes sense .
1	6B	i do n't know . i 'm - i 'm not sure a county needs a veterinary hospital .
2	6B	for the school .
1	6B	probably the taxi stops .
1	3I	that makes sense to me .
1	3I	uh , perhaps near the toilet paper and bars of soap ?
1	3I	and then tubing or one of those . i do n't know .
1	6B	yep . yeah .
1	3I	legumes .
2	3I	unless - no .
1	6B	yeah , that sounds good . so that leaves us still cutting assistant cooks -
1	3I	and we also have , like - do n't we have , like , water jugs and things like that that trunc
1	3I	that 'd go over there .
1	6B	alright , so weed control and invasive species ?
1	3I	like , right here maybe ?
0	3I	we 'll see how fast she comes in . sht !
2	6B	and i can see the benefits that a football team would bring to an area .
1	6B	or i mean king county , i guess .
1	3I	sort of opposite here because this is personal things , and clothes are personal .
0	3I	where 's the garden stuff ?
1	3I	okay , so five-pound weights . are those sport things or are those , um , hardware things ?
1	6B	i wonder if s_t_d_ education is redundant then .
0	3I	making rustling .
1	6B	combine that with the public news station .
2	6B	so can that !
2	6B	i 'm thinking , well , a person can learn to cook without a home economics class .
1	6B	so this is like a harder thing i guess .
1	3I	that 's true . match might be kinda short .
0	6B	was there any more ?
2	6B	than - than just weeds .
1	3I	nice . okay , tow ropes .
1	6B	yeah , i was gon na say the - the port oughta run that . okay . so we 're gon na get rid of taxi stops and flagpole repair .
1	3I	box of dough - that does seem like the -
2	3I	this is gon na get interesting .
2	6B	i never took any bookkeeping classes . did you ?
2	6B	that honestly is not - top priority . that can be cut too , potentially . book keeping classes - what 'd th-
0	3I	kay . now we have some boots -
0	6B	i do n't know much about that .
1	6B	is that okay with you , cynthia ?
1	3I	we have all the food over there so it 's not gon na fit there .
1	3I	and small saws in case you wan na sink your boat . cuz you can -
1	3I	yeah . okay , bottles of juice .
1	3I	small axes , maybe over there by the power cords ?
1	3I	that makes sense .
1	3I	that makes sense .
1	3I	that makes sense .
1	3I	that makes sense .
1	3I	that makes sense .
2	3I	thinking it could be either here , or , like , here .
1	3I	and that is too .
1	6B	and pest control . we can keep that , right ?
2	3I	gas-powered cookstoves would definitely go in this area .
1	3I	garage .
2	6B	only ?
0	6B	i do n't know what that means .
0	6B	i do n't know what that means .
2	6B	it 's really hard to cut something from public health and safety .
2	6B	or however if you - kept .
0	6B	a public -
1	3I	perhaps with the , uh - other things that we 're storing .
2	3I	yeah . actually , it would go up in here . uh -
1	6B	it does .
1	3I	it does .
0	6B	um . flag pole . taxi stops .
1	3I	thinking trunc oh .
0	3I	whiskey .
0	3I	whiskey .
0	3I	whiskey -
0	3I	whiskey .
1	3I	what if - ?
1	6B	that might be a little excessive , huh ?
1	3I	kay cans of peas .
2	3I	i like mine with sugar . that 's the way i eat mine . large cups .
1	3I	tow ropes . that would be hardware .
0	3I	yeah , and refrigerated items -
1	3I	backpack . that could be near travel guides .
0	3I	gas powered cookstoves .
1	3I	up there ? oh yeah , we got our bakery . we got our bakery - bakery aisle over here .
1	3I	yeah , i would put it over here um .
1	6B	okay . sounds good .
2	3I	uh let 's put it over here with the -
1	3I	and this is , uh supplies . like , utility .
0	6B	p_ environmental science .
0	6B	nurses in the high schools .
2	3I	well , i think this clearly should be trunc the food aisles , right ? are we doing - there 's an aisle on either side , right ?
0	3I	sugar , ice cream , cake mix , and eggs .
0	3I	we got wetsuits .
1	3I	food for - for the trail .
1	6B	uh . dog catcher and reusable bag campaign .
2	6B	but - you know - the problem is , like trunc they were saying in trunc oh , it 's true in this state too , but they - they , uh - you know -
2	6B	they make money on them too , but it 's a much , much smaller person - i mean , they 're f-
2	6B	well , i do n't trunc i would take - that 's one of my first candidates . it really is . because taxi stops , uh , exist in places , and they 're useful . but nobody trunc i mean , we 're talking about seattle . they do n't really get used . i mean , in some places . there 's huge lines for them in airports . you have a specialized - but the airport runs that .
1	6B	sounds good . um . i 'd - i 'd like to keep that .
1	6B	the bookkeeping . yeah .
2	6B	should be in reproductive education .
0	6B	so public access is like -
1	3I	maybe we should put it over here somewhere .
1	3I	we got a nice store .
2	3I	uh we 'll put it underneath the tweezers , in that sorta health and beauty section .
2	6B	so the money was already there for it .
2	6B	it 's pretty different populations , actually . teenagers and adults .
0	6B	just like wild ones , all over the place ?
1	3I	and stoves .
1	3I	and stoves .
1	3I	i suppose it c-
2	3I	face cream . toiletries . where we got - okay .
2	3I	i mean , the doughnuts . the doughnuts could be .
1	3I	would be with clothes . i do n't either .
0	6B	now recreation . uh -
2	3I	this ? next to the bundles of sticks . large cups .
1	3I	maybe with the axes or something .
0	3I	is there anything else ?
1	3I	put that next to the tow ropes .
2	3I	put it , like , near this stuff . maybe , like , put it here ? or here ?
2	3I	well , i would say this is home . um , kinda more i think for a - for a - um , deck at home .
1	3I	yeah , we can decide what we ordered .
1	6B	the only reason i 'm saying this -
2	6B	well - uh - you know , uh , sports kept my kids off the streets too . but -
2	6B	injured animals are found in the street or something .
0	3I	i was - it , like , worked for me . i do n't know , people , like always move in a certain direction , um and i think it has something to do with , like , the , uh , way you drive in that country , what side you drive on - people are , like , used to moving in a certain direction . yeah , so they 'll arrange things , like , get the - the - i do n't know maybe towards -
1	6B	to that - uh -
1	6B	for instance -
2	6B	but those drainage ditches could be maintained by -
1	3I	oh , yeah yeah that 's true . yeah , this is trunc you could , like , travel . you trunc get some wetsuits .
2	3I	no . not really .
1	3I	could be here . could be there .
2	3I	do we have a weapons section ? should be with the tools .
2	3I	cake and chocolate bars go together , but trunc like , s'mores , people looking for s'mores , yep . and bagels -
1	6B	okay . kitten and puppy adoption . yeah .
1	3I	oh . look at that .
2	3I	i think we can put it in the outdoor - it 'll be bigger , too , and i feel like it should go on the side .
0	6B	and there 's a public access channel .
1	6B	take that over ?
2	6B	i do n't care about the football stadium .
0	3I	canvas bags .
0	3I	canvas bags .
0	3I	canvas bags .
0	3I	canvas bags .
0	3I	canvas bags .
0	3I	canvas bags .
2	6B	bagel factory inspections , they can go off for a little while . hospital additions . ehm .
0	3I	uh , distilled water for -
1	3I	backpacks , buckets . and then food is -
1	6B	mm . maybe . i dunno if we need that .
1	3I	wherever .
0	3I	alright , um , toothpaste ?
0	6B	can we manage to get rid of six from every single thing else ?
1	3I	we could hold off on the cases of whiskey , maybe , and see what else comes up .
2	3I	that 's out of place . because that 's in the freezer .
0	3I	so we have fish hooks .
2	6B	and then we 'd have three from each category . we could do that .
2	6B	i think think probably schools need that .
1	3I	maybe at the end of the food aisle ?
1	6B	tattoo artist licenses and massage certificates .
2	6B	are we cancelling it ?
2	6B	additional bus stops i 'm always for .
1	3I	oh , i think i use those in the bathroom although you could take out -
2	6B	trunc uh - i mean , i do n't know . like , in - trunc in puyallup , like , the football stadium -
2	6B	if they 're - if , uh , the county is providing that -
0	3I	got buckets .
2	3I	i actually do n't even like whiskey .
1	6B	well , that 's something i think that people will pick up too .
2	6B	or , like , art
2	6B	no , that 's not what it says .
2	3I	you know , just for carrying around a drink . no , we have to do this one .
2	3I	sounds good . got ta get some bars of soap there too . so . got ta - got ta stay clean .
1	6B	so maybe we can let a non-profit take over the food bank .
2	6B	the , um - i guess we 're gon na have to cut out additional bus stops . okay , i 'm with you there .
1	3I	with the power cords . yeah .
1	3I	not quite deadly , but construction-ish .
0	6B	any kind of show . yeah , it 's on t_v_ .
1	6B	needle exchange , i think is a basic public health issue .
1	3I	this is surprisingly fun .
1	3I	should go by the checkout .
0	3I	gas-powered cookstoves . that -
1	6B	yeah , that 's true . but i think that means like the government keeps track of who has boats and who does n't .
2	3I	i - that 's not how i would -
1	3I	liquids with liquids .
2	6B	trunc cooking classes .
1	6B	we can keep one .
1	6B	okay , so that was four . let 's - so , let 's go over the four that we - we - uh , kay . we said , um , speech therapy .
1	6B	that 's important , but it also does n't seem like it 'd be trunc funded by the community .
2	6B	if you trunc like , if you put them in , like most important to , like , least important .
2	3I	alright . got some pre-cut wood . so that would go up there but we 're looking a little crammed up in that corner of the store -
2	6B	so , given that they keep changing the way they teach math , i think math tutors are pretty essential
0	3I	okay , we are done . we 're done .
1	3I	and soybeans would be - are dry .
1	6B	yeah , job training seems good , so that 's five .
0	6B	alright . let 's see . so we have two for sure , maybe three under that one .
2	6B	more rural , it would probably be -
1	3I	would you ? okay .
0	6B	they were , you know real nurses who helped with things like that .
2	6B	a specific station .
1	3I	oh , that 's true . that 's fine . yeah .
0	6B	and i think it 's call total reclaim .
2	6B	and that could be - also be more along the lines of like prenatal .
0	6B	listening to random thing , oh hey there 's a sneeze . okay , okay . continuing . uh . prenatal checkups .
2	6B	pothole maintenance . cuz seattle has lot 's of potholes , i guess . in fact , they 're not trunc okay , i 'm not gon na be political , but yeah . subway system .
3	6B	trunc that you would have to keep , because you ca n't not -
2	6B	so i 'm willing to part with the notetakers , as well .
0	6B	what are they referring to ?
1	3I	so maybe in this section where the clothes are trunc forming up ?
2	3I	well , cuz it all , uh - wetsuits by boating supplies .
2	6B	let 's keep custodians ! they 're really important
1	3I	flags . okay . wan na put that so -
2	6B	i 'm so glad you got that reference okay . uh . toxic waste disposal .
1	3I	hats . where 's our clothing ?
0	6B	yeah . oh , do they still ?
0	6B	what are we adding ?
1	6B	the flagpole repair .
2	3I	toys is gon na be awfully alone up here .
1	3I	let 's go from mouse traps . let 's go down from there .
2	6B	a public - a public veterinary hospital is just like no .
1	6B	of the -
1	3I	oh , yeah yeah . like , outdoors stuff .
1	3I	let 's go with that .
1	3I	either magnets or mousetraps .
1	3I	maybe we 'll make a produce section down here .
1	6B	i do n't feel that -
1	3I	i wonder if we could put them - yeah . maybe we could have - cuz i do n't - right . cuz i do n't see any clothing , so let 's - yeah , let 's start a clothing thing . and this - this is kind of too , because travel guides can kind of be - okay .
1	3I	should we put those before the sugar ?
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing
0	6B	a public access station .
0	6B	i - i 'm a -
1	3I	in that section up there .
0	3I	duct tape and -
2	6B	yes and no more taxi stops .
1	3I	i dunno what flags are .
1	3I	so i 'm gon na get us more here . cuz i 'm holding on to this one .
0	6B	or would they trunc they would n't sign up for em . would kids do em if they did n't have em ?
1	3I	down here with our -
1	3I	wetsuits , that 's going - that 's what we had to have beforequal laughing - yeah . precut wood , that 's here .
2	6B	but i think it 's - it 's - trunc it 's , um -
1	3I	yeah . i could see it there kinda hardware-y -
1	3I	oh , probably with out-
1	3I	um , so these are sorta more sundries , i think ?
0	3I	hats . okay .
1	6B	so , yeah sugar free juice machines are out .
1	3I	over - yeah .
2	6B	public news station . that 's a good thing .
2	3I	but that 's a crap shoot .
2	6B	i know . i know .
1	6B	i think we 've done j-
2	3I	i mean , it should n't go like right there next to cookies . that 's just weird .
1	6B	which one ?
1	3I	which one ?
1	3I	which one ?
1	3I	produce , maybe it would be somewhere here ?
2	6B	ca n't take that from the kids . public access station , what is that ?
2	3I	water 1 - away from the power cords . tow rope tow rope .
1	6B	yeah . i - i do n't know .
2	6B	yeah , boating licenses seems more important than a tattoo artist license , .
0	6B	do n't quite know what that is .
2	3I	bundle of sticks ? kindling .
1	3I	luckily .
1	3I	that 's kind of -
1	6B	acting coaches ? and add back music teachers ?
2	3I	or , um -
0	6B	alrighty is there more ?
1	3I	got ta go with ice cream or sugar ?
1	3I	uh , liters of water . mm-kay .
1	6B	to take home stuff . yeah . soup kitchens . yeah .
0	6B	additional bus stops , speed limit trunc
2	3I	i 'd either put it with the power cords or with the siding .
2	3I	well it could go with either cake mix - but , you know , ice cream 's desert . yeah , i think it 's fine .
2	6B	it 's really nice that you took that - now , and we left the math tutors and the acting coaches . some would say the acting coaches need to go . some would say -
1	6B	and assistant cooks ? okay .
1	3I	camping , or sundries thing .
0	3I	um bottles of juice . so we have food stuffs - um .
1	6B	not that they - not that they could n't walk a little further .
2	6B	well what - and then just looking at - see when they say massage certificates it 's sorta like what ? are we is the city in - or this - department in the business of training trunc trunc massage therapists to get trunc ? cuz it says - as opposed to licensing but i 'm assuming it 's licensing . or certifying . same with trunc then i - i think that 's important . and keeping the teaching .
1	3I	either here or in the fridge .
1	6B	oh , and acting coaches . we got - we got rid of three things .
1	3I	and half-inch tubing , that 's in here .
1	6B	i do want pothole maintenance .
0	6B	subway system . okay .
2	3I	well , that 's a pretty funny looking store , but - it makes some sense .
1	3I	so maybe here ? just general . maybe - maybe mousetraps in your barn or your shed .
1	6B	we wan na put the soccer league back in ?
1	3I	things for - that you 'd use in a bathroom ?
1	3I	then clothing .
0	3I	ah , small axes . we -
1	3I	closing . closing , i ca n't even speak . clothing .
1	3I	and across and trunc up from cases of whiskey . so also celebratory .
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs . that 's the kinda cushions .
1	6B	so , we 're gon na do hospital additions and neighborhood watch .
2	3I	uh , i 'd put that in the healthy section . next to the soybeans , maybe are we allowed to put them down there ?
2	3I	i trunc i think anybody who 's looking for that trunc is gon na go through that whole aisle .
1	6B	sorry , yeah . weed control . yeah . weed control and s_t_d_ education .
0	3I	kay , mint toothpaste .
2	6B	but that 's a u_s_d_a_ thing . push that off on the government .
1	3I	cut it 's - it 's still in its same position .
1	6B	properly fund , you know , the soup kitchen and the -
0	3I	okay . chocolate bars .
1	3I	so if we wanted to -
0	3I	and i 've got heavy cable here .
2	6B	they 're not gon na build the hospital based only on federal money .
1	3I	order ; cookies , donuts , bagels ?
1	6B	i - i like sex ed . i trunc i think that 's okay .
0	3I	not really but - well , there 's boating stuff , but other than that -
2	6B	question mark , i think , even though it 's probably important . uh , needle exchange .
1	3I	put it on the other side of the power cords that would kinda make sense . so you can plug in your electric heater . that makes -
1	3I	probably by the sugar .
1	3I	do - down there ?
1	3I	we 'll just cheat a little bit , put it up there .
2	6B	cooking classes could be cut .
1	3I	or do you want it over here ? like -
0	6B	um
0	6B	um
1	3I	let 's see what we got .
1	6B	reusable bags .
1	3I	backpacks would be -
1	6B	trunc the -
0	6B	community news ads . i do n't even really know what that is . um -
2	6B	well , it 's a regional hospital now . it 's part of a -
0	6B	okay . mm-hm .
1	6B	i think that -
1	6B	think dog catcher stands out for me .
1	6B	yeah , what is taxi stops ?
0	3I	and we used to like playing trunc you know , where you can only like -
2	3I	there we go . soap - ooh , cookies . packages of them .
2	3I	and then we can , like , fill this area with other clothes items if we needed .
0	6B	towing .
2	6B	i would cut that one out .
1	3I	sure , that 'll work .
1	3I	could be - could be here .
1	3I	one at a time but we do n't have that uh -
2	6B	there 's plenty of people -
0	3I	well we know -
2	6B	yeah , cutting a dog catcher . i 'd definitely cut the dog catcher ! um -
1	6B	additional bus stops , we should keep .
0	6B	and was it the football equipment ?
0	6B	that 's a licensing thing . yeah .
2	3I	oh , that 's - put that trunc put that with -
1	3I	trunc do that .
2	6B	then let 's keep the reproductive education .
1	6B	so . do you agree with that ?
1	3I	perhaps - of course , you can use them in the kitchen as well .
2	6B	look at the marijuana laws -
1	3I	yeah maybe above it so i kind of can go either way .
1	3I	packages of cookies . doughnuts .
0	3I	uh , it 's right under the boat , there . top - top left . bundles of sticks .
2	3I	or power cords .
1	3I	socks . thick sweaters . hats . and then we 've got flags .
2	6B	let 's keep the soup kitchens .
1	3I	mm , travel guides . yeah . yeah . okay . yeah .
1	6B	what would - ?
0	6B	and end scene .
1	3I	oh , that could be -
1	6B	appropriate and look through and see .
2	3I	you 'd have doughnuts on one side of the aisle and cookies on the other . this is my virgo . or would they be all like -
1	3I	just fresh .
2	6B	but you ca n't buy it . you ca n't legally buy it . and i just think that 's really hilarious . and they were talking about that in colorado . it 's the same problem .
2	6B	let 's - i 'd - we 've already like cut a few so let 's go ahead and just see what we have . um , football stadium upkeep .
1	3I	near , uh - well , wait - trunc yeah .
0	6B	um , let 's see , which ones did we decide to get rid of ? we got rid of the sex ed -
1	6B	assistant cooks . well , assistant to who ?
1	3I	they might work with -
0	3I	fish hooks.0
1	3I	to toilet paper ? yeah . paper supplies .
1	6B	well , that 's true ,
1	3I	well , that 's true .
1	3I	well , that 's true .
1	6B	i like the other ones more . um -
1	6B	i feel like pothole maintenance is pretty important .
1	6B	yeah we - i -it says we must discuss each item and reach an agreement about whether - to cut it or to continue funding .
1	6B	that 's sort of in with the invasive species . it -
1	3I	bait as well .
1	3I	we 've got it !
0	6B	uh , what 'd we say ? trunc oh , the public access station and the boys ' basketball club .
1	3I	let 's put it there .
2	6B	they do n't need public funding , really . so we do n't really need do public funding for hospital additions so we can cut that .
1	3I	it still could go there .
0	3I	have you ever heard the expression uh , bob 's your uncle ?
1	3I	go down here then .
2	3I	the rolls of ducts tape .
1	6B	i hope not . that - that 'd be a little crazy . um .
2	6B	oh my gosh . how can you say no to that ? how can you get rid of that ? definitely .
2	3I	you had one row of all food , and this is one row of all food . so maybe we 've got - one , two - see , we 've got two trunc or aisles . maybe - maybe we can do that . yeah .
1	3I	i think up .
0	3I	whiskey , cookies , cake .
2	6B	yeah . it 's regulation by the state . that 's - that 's right .
0	6B	did you - did you finish ?
2	3I	and then the nets below there .
0	6B	so that 's trunc four ?
1	3I	so that in the -
1	6B	trunc for taking out .
1	3I	i could see this being trunc maybe something that you - ah , ah . i do n't know .
1	3I	yeah . i 'll go ahead and put it - uh -
1	6B	that 'd be a good thing .
0	3I	hm , yeah .
0	6B	the stadium upkeep .
0	6B	the stadium upkeep ?
2	6B	remove reproductive education .
2	6B	that 's becoming pretty much automated now , right ?
2	6B	yeah , trunc i think they need to be licensed , yes .
2	3I	with the chocolate . soap . then where 's the toilet paper ? there ?
1	3I	i 'd put it with the wetsuits and the -
1	3I	yeah , we are . matches , bags , yeah let 's - let 's just - yeah , keep - keep going here .
2	6B	it 's really great . i , you know i once took a little bag with two little neon bulbs , but you can take a computer . i had a kitchen aid mixer that trunc trunc had totally died , the bearings were totally shot .
0	6B	soup kitchen ?
0	3I	we do n't really have any hardware stuff or gardening .
1	6B	the dispatcher contracted . yeah .
2	6B	then you would have to , uh -
1	3I	toilet paper , alright .
2	6B	any more -
1	3I	probably maybe by travel guides .
1	3I	face cream probably should go around toilet paper .
1	3I	ah , yeah . backpack there .
2	6B	if you 're hardcore enough to get a tattoo then , who cares if you know you get one without a trunc like a licensed person . i dunno . yeah .
0	6B	um - bus stops and flagpoles .
1	3I	that was an easy one .
1	3I	trunc should that go in the cooler ?
1	3I	empty plastic jugs , by the water ?
1	3I	yes , it could .
2	3I	i was outdoor activities area .
1	3I	let 's wait and see .
2	6B	if we increase the stray cat spaying , we wo n't need any of the kitty adoption .
0	3I	now is that it ?
1	3I	so essentially , we 're looking at -
1	3I	type of category , or put it - ?
2	6B	yep . then there 's boy 's basketball club . but that 's just boys . junior soccer league is for - both .
1	3I	travel guides and -
1	3I	yeah and peat - moss is sort of -
1	6B	oh , i did n't know that ! um , i mean that 's kinda cool .
1	3I	next to the light coats .
2	6B	so you have upper elementary , which is four through six -
1	6B	we could 've -
2	3I	oh but trunc but they 'd have room up here and up here . okay .
1	3I	across the aisle from the boating supplies .
2	3I	school supplies . books , yeah . okay . gas-powered cookstoves . oh , that 's like , trunc here .
2	6B	question mark . um , acting coaches ?
1	3I	yeah , that 's good .
1	3I	yeah , that 's good .
1	3I	yeah , that 's good .
2	6B	either that , or -
1	3I	yeah , let 's - okay . books .
1	6B	junior soccer league , i can go right there immediately . uh , we got ta maintain it . we obviously got ta maintain our fields , but i thought the leagues -
2	6B	cuz you got reproductive education , and maybe that would cover that .
1	3I	thick sweaters . oh , we get to pick that ourselves .
1	3I	your turn . grab a few .
1	6B	so - so take it from the approach of what we 're going to keep first , maybe ? or i do n't know .
2	3I	hey .
1	3I	okay . trunc and books . i do n't think there 's a -
2	6B	oh , yeah , they 're definitely important .
0	6B	reuse .
1	6B	probably also kind of important . needle exchange .
1	3I	yeah , i 'll just put it in here just -
1	6B	of our city . i do n't know . if it 's a huge - like , seattle . like , community news ads are -
2	6B	well , let 's see . math tutors we agree trunc we should keep , right ?
2	3I	you know , actually , the box knives probably belong up with the mousetraps .
2	6B	so maybe not on that one .
0	6B	do you work with earthcorps , or - ?
1	3I	pa-yeah
3	6B	we can look at something , and say , like , definitely not cut , definitely do cut , or unsure . and then i can keep track just , like , on my hands how many things we say we definitely should cut . and then - i do n't know . if you have any other ideas . but that 's just what i thought might be a good idea . and then we could maybe revisit them .
1	6B	i - that 's what i would probably cut .
1	3I	in the middle , okay .
1	3I	trunc let 's make a whole clothing section . let 's not mix em up .
1	3I	either one , i think would be trunc i trunc i - i think of more that one . yeah .
2	6B	and junior high , i would - i feel more trunc i feel worse about cutting the arts . cuz i feel like people can always just do sports trunc for whatever , but arts are something that you need more like -
0	6B	those invasive weeds .
2	3I	last aisle we 've got some good -
0	6B	uh , yes .
1	3I	but i do n't know if we have like items .
2	6B	well , maybe . i think it 's more like if you - if you 're like - needing , food bank . and soup kitchen -
1	3I	uh , maybe next to those items ? on two ?
1	3I	trunc good . exactly . there you go .
2	3I	mm-hm . here 's the hard one . five-pound weights .
2	3I	yeah . yeah , this should - oh , trunc scissors ! scissors would go with school supplies , would n't it ?
2	6B	and that 's what they trunc that 's what they thought in the - think in the bank , too , but when they 're sitting there and they actually counting money in front of you -
2	3I	mm-hm , again , toiletries .
2	6B	it 's almost like a trunc i do n't want to call it a luxury , but - it 's kida like a luxury service to have like if you 've got all your bases covered , and you have extra money then you 'd have a needle exchange .
0	6B	and how many is that ?
2	6B	uh , towing services - you need to have that contract .
0	6B	mm-kay , that 's two .
1	6B	sorry larry . yeah .
1	3I	yeah , boating supplies .
1	3I	oh , that 's for fishing .
2	6B	i - uh - i do n't know how i feel about neighborhood watch support . i feel like that 's -
0	6B	acting .
1	6B	we could cut - we could cut one of the sports so we have boy 's basketball club and junior soccer league .
1	3I	yeah . so , yeah . maybe with the bottles of juice and stuff ?
0	6B	about those things .
0	3I	um . what would i put it by ?
2	6B	so if we 're talking about adults , what are we trying to teach them ?
1	3I	okay , so would we say that would be more a trunc trunc a , like food -
2	3I	uh , heavy cable , yeah , it definitely needs to go -
1	3I	light jackets , with more clothing ?
1	6B	yeah . stick with that trend .
1	3I	that 's the gardening stuff . do we have any - ? we have nothing for gardening .
0	3I	- there trunc there were , um -
2	6B	well , i think we could go to three . um -
1	3I	that should be down in the food somewhere .
1	3I	axes , is the wood out yet ?
2	6B	now , would n't reproductive ed and s_t_d_ ed go in the - hand and hand .
0	6B	or whatever trunc oh , it 's a county . yeah , um -
2	3I	cuz there 's no room , here , so -
2	6B	nah it 's public health .
1	3I	looks nice , see .
2	6B	yeah , see the reason behind that one though is public health .
1	3I	packages of cookies , over here with the sinful stuff . oh , and we 've got a chocolate bar too .
1	3I	or just carrying . trunc household .
1	3I	then the face cream , okay .
1	3I	you think trunc ?
2	6B	what do we need bagel factory inspections for ?
0	6B	yeah , we did too .
2	3I	or one of - one of the - or one of those little trunc twirly things , you know .
1	3I	there i think .
1	6B	more from here , because i think we were pretty brutal .
1	3I	bundles of sticks . so , i 'm just gon na put it somewhere in here .
1	6B	the next one - we agreed on reproductive education -
1	6B	the county government , or -
2	6B	geez this is hard .
0	3I	where - ?
1	3I	and socks with the shoelaces .
2	6B	yeah , prenatal check-ups , important . neighborhood watch support , that might have to i do n't know . what do you think ? that - that would be pretty -
0	6B	safety , ooh -
2	3I	thick trunc no , there 's no clothing up here .
2	6B	we 're looking for what does n't fit .
2	3I	obviously . water and whiskey , they go together .
1	3I	how bout that ?
1	3I	personal care , definitely .
1	6B	so , if we get three , what would they be , then ? maybe fishing and hunting , and -
1	3I	box knives , something
1	3I	i - i mean it 's not something that 's close to anything we have . in terms of , um - how it 's used , or where it 's used .
2	3I	cuz the ice cream and the eggs make sense . those would be together .
2	3I	no . well , but we 're going to with - the peat moss is down here , so that 's close enough . okay .
1	6B	i mean , that is good for the environmental issues that it brings up okay , so we 've got -
2	3I	cuz we have axes , matches -
1	6B	mm . maybe that trunc we 'll hafta decide that later .
1	6B	should we move over to the next category , infrastructure and licensing ?
1	6B	so that 's one .
2	3I	yeah , i would put it more in kitchen stuff .
2	3I	i know . that 's right . we have have n't handed anybody a - a map yet .
1	3I	trunc liters of water would be trunc food for the trail .
0	6B	um , maybe new -
2	3I	oh my gosh . do we go through this trunc entire box ?
2	6B	eh . i feel like if i trunc
2	3I	or would we like to put them next to the backpacks ?
1	3I	above it ?
2	3I	down by the power cords .
0	6B	er .
0	6B	er .
1	6B	very important .
1	6B	got ta cut two .
1	3I	eh ,  probably by the figs and oatmeal , maybe .
0	3I	and then you had your , um , shoelaces -
2	6B	oh yeah . that 's redundant .
2	3I	and these are jackets and hats . these are outdoor things .
1	6B	so potentially we could cut that one . let 's keep going , but -
1	3I	okay , so i would i guess put it on the last row with food .
1	3I	well canvas bags -
1	6B	yeah yeah . okay . so , let 's go through education and programs .
1	3I	face cream . totally .
2	6B	yeah . so keep what we have . um . tattoo artist licenses it 's definitely a good idea to keep them licensed .
1	3I	we will .
2	3I	ice cream . no . i do n't know . um , we can -
1	3I	with the donuts ? okay .
2	6B	well , what do they trunc what do you think , if they mean towing services , like , for towing their own -
1	3I	my initial thought was exercise .
1	6B	football equipment , yeah .
1	3I	much better .
1	3I	what was already up .
0	3I	packages .
2	3I	up here , you think ?
1	6B	i guess . yeah , that 's probably important then . yeah .
0	3I	hm , hm .
1	3I	that 's just the area where they cut things .
1	6B	but let 's go with uh -
1	3I	toys , refrigerator magnets , toilet paper , ah-ha . that 's kind of - that 's either a paper good or a toiletry but i think - yeah .
1	6B	squirrels or something .
1	3I	so now i have small axes . and i trunc i think we 're gon na put camping up here , right ?
2	3I	unless you want that over here .
1	6B	absolutely . we know that 's true .
1	6B	important , then ?
1	3I	yeah . or - what do you do with wetsuits ? i suppose they could go with fish hooks .
1	3I	you know , y-
2	6B	it 's real important for public health though .
1	3I	empty space .
2	3I	i 'm not sure though . mm .
2	6B	bookkeeping , that 's not - that 's an elective sort of thing , it 's - i think if - if we 're going to keep something it 's better to keep , like music or you know , even acting coaches because in some ways they can reach people -
1	6B	uh , it seems like it -
1	3I	books of matches . maybe that goes in this section too . you think ? yeah .
2	3I	the eggs , that would be trunc like , with the dairy - dairy , refrigerator . ice cream and eggs should be together . i 'd put them together , but -
0	6B	comes down to -
1	3I	pouches of oatmeal . i think that would go in this section here .
1	3I	cuz then it 's , like , already on your back trunc you 're looking at cookstoves . i do n't know .
1	6B	housing assistance and the food bank .
2	6B	well i 'm having trouble with reproductive and sexually transmitted . one or the other .
1	3I	okay , that 's fresh food , down here .
1	6B	i mean , it kinda depends .
2	6B	that 's the one that i see there .
0	6B	free .
1	6B	one of the educations . either reproductive or s_t_d_ , do you agree ?
1	6B	mm-hm yeah .
1	6B	mm-hm yeah .
1	6B	the public access station , let 's assume that is wi-fi and internet access .
1	3I	or maybe like this - this aisle is trunc almost all empty .
1	3I	right - how bout there ?
0	6B	what do you mean ? like -
0	3I	a trunc what do i call it ?
2	6B	public spaces .
1	6B	yeah . true . yeah .
2	3I	i have sticks of butter which seem to go well just underneath the sugar .
2	3I	yeah , yeah . yeah , yeah , put it beside it .
0	6B	fifteen . so if we took five from each one it would be a third of a -
1	3I	uh , maybe that would go more with hardware by the power cords . oh .
1	3I	small axes with the boxes of knives and pre-cut wood , all of these -
1	3I	yes , good .
0	3I	chocolate bars .
0	3I	chocolate bars .
0	3I	chocolate bars -
0	3I	chocolate bars .
0	3I	chocolate bars !
0	3I	chocolate bars .
0	3I	chocolate bars .
0	3I	chocolate bars .
0	3I	chocolate bars .
0	3I	chocolate bars .
0	3I	chocolate bars .
1	3I	buckets could go here .
1	3I	in the grocery trunc well -
2	6B	pfft . this is tough .
1	3I	yeah yeah , that 's close enough .
1	6B	i 'd say yes , compared to the other ones .
1	6B	but i can see where there 's a little wiggle room .
1	3I	yeah good yeah . scissors .
1	6B	yeah , i do n't know about that one .
1	6B	eh . i do n't think we need to keep funding that .
2	6B	football equipment ? does the county need to provide that ?
0	3I	and loose leaf paper ?
1	3I	i would put that kind of by boating supplies .
1	3I	maybe - of course this - there 's this side too . we forget . let 's do this . where do you want it ?
1	6B	yeah , well we can take trunc maybe they are n't planning even cutting those , see ? yeah . it trunc trunc yeah .
1	3I	yeah , alright .
1	3I	mm . yeah . box knives . i would think .
2	3I	um , we could put the trunc let 's put the books and toys together .
2	6B	people can drink water . they do n't need to drink juice . okay , so - so -
2	6B	yeah , i looked at em all . i think the sugar-free juice machines . cuz they can bring it from home !
1	6B	of a trunc county . so that 's - that 's a - that 's a whole county , that 's a pretty big -
1	3I	what about next to the bottles of juice ?
0	6B	ace hardware .
2	6B	oh , no .
1	3I	sort of household equipment , yeah . choo
1	3I	what if we - ?
0	6B	dog catcher . so there 's three things right there .
1	3I	along with the outdoorsy things ? maybe -
1	6B	yes , we are . alright ! five . public health and safety .
1	3I	yeah . i thin so .
0	6B	um is this for , like , low income people , or -
1	3I	here are some household items .
1	6B	too many -
1	6B	weed control , and -
1	3I	when you 're on the toilet you read books . small saws , i think that might be - buckets . maybe near the bags of peat moss ?
1	3I	fleece lined boots . well , that goes up by the vests and the socks . we have just a space between em .
1	3I	putting it behind the toilet paper , or before ?
0	6B	do n't really know how that 's funded trunc necessarily .
1	6B	yeah . i ca n't -
1	6B	trunc right .
0	3I	box of knives .
1	3I	small saws . okay .
1	3I	these are small .
2	6B	what would - what in the world is a public veterinary hospital ?
1	3I	i would say next to , yeah , the toilet paper .
1	3I	if it works for the nakatas , yes .
1	3I	okay . what do you think ? there ? or there ?
1	3I	trunc kinda toiletries an-
0	3I	and this is all non-food things .
0	3I	oh trunc what did we do with the office stuff ?
2	3I	there could be a xylophone in here .
1	3I	i 'm trunc i 'm thinking yeah .
1	3I	wetsuits are kinda , like -
0	6B	for taking out .
2	3I	i do n't think it 's bad .
0	3I	um , socks ?
1	6B	pretty infrequent thing . but you never know , maybe not .
0	6B	what does that mean ?
0	6B	what does that mean ?
1	6B	library .
2	6B	um . what 's the budget for that anymore ? um -
1	3I	right there , maybe ?
1	3I	yeah yeah .
1	6B	yeah yeah .
1	3I	yeah yeah .
1	3I	yeah yeah .
1	3I	yeah yeah ,
1	3I	yeah yeah .
1	3I	yeah yeah .
1	3I	matches are probably up there .
2	6B	yeah , i was just thinking , a clean - clean up , trunc is different than like ,
1	6B	and if you 're gon na have sugar few - sugar free -
1	3I	large vests , heavy coats .
1	3I	uh , yeah , i trunc i would think of camping or backpacking or - shoelaces .
1	3I	toys , and er -
1	3I	electric heaters . should i put it - ?
0	3I	okay um so we said -
2	3I	good . and trunc they can go up opposite if we need to . rolls of duct tape is gon na go with mouse traps .
0	3I	has n't stuck yet .
2	6B	right , we do n't . we 've said the words .
0	3I	yeah . um , thick sweaters .
1	6B	yes . drama coaches , yes .
1	3I	maybe , like , by the power cords ?
2	6B	ooh , this is gon na be tough .
2	6B	because i think we can get rid of some of these licenses .
0	6B	so , we 're going to nix the assistant cooks -
1	6B	alright , let 's go for it . i - i agree with that .
1	3I	be inclined to maybe put that here , along with the bundles of sticks .
2	3I	so let 's put it right in here in the middle somewhere .
1	6B	yeah that 's it . yeah . yeah , yeah . you 're right .
1	6B	yeah . but -
1	3I	the whisky goes by toys , right ?
0	6B	not - it depends on like what you 're hunting . it -
1	6B	seems like it could be a private thing too .
1	6B	trunc fishing trunc i - yeah , i like the fishing licenses i think public buse-
2	3I	fish hooks , that looks like it would probably go pretty much right there .
0	3I	i know , avoid that .
1	6B	to keep the number of -
1	3I	to - to uh - like , sugar and cake mix . we 're kinda -
2	6B	bagel factory inspections . you got ta have it for public health .
1	6B	they 've sort of rationalized the groups .
2	6B	i do n't think it trunc i do n't think it should - any of it should be in the - in the schools
2	6B	it needs to stay .
2	6B	that 's pretty important . so if we were to get rid of four -
2	6B	yeah that 's your - that 's your line . not mine .
2	6B	uh , the food bank .
2	6B	i think we kept that one . yeah . we did keep that one cuz we said we thought that was important .
1	6B	yes . it 's not moose season .
0	6B	fourteen .
0	6B	fourteen .
0	6B	fourteen -
1	3I	okay , face cream , right ?
0	3I	uh . well .
2	6B	i think the public access station i think would be where people can go for social services and um , get information and and things like that , so i think that 's important . the public news station -
1	3I	seem to be a stationary area , or near the backpacks .
2	6B	but they have to tow the cars they 're -
1	6B	let 's just build the worst -
1	3I	with oatmeal .
2	6B	i trunc i - i feel like , the licenses -
2	3I	yeah , maybe if we could make a little produce aisle down there . okay . um -
1	3I	trunc trunc i 'm thinking the -
1	3I	i would put them next to cake mix . that would make sense to me . i think a lot of stores put their baking good and their baked goods next to each other .
1	6B	tone .
1	3I	bagels ! so bagels -
1	3I	yep . oh i already have one - good one . chocolate bars . i 'd put them maybe up with the sugar and the cookies . and the doughnuts .
1	3I	trunc just books . okay . wan na put scissors here too ?
1	3I	maybe with the toothpaste ?
2	3I	the two places i 'm seeing that would make the most sense in my head would be down here . or by these -
1	6B	but it is a license . it is a license .
1	6B	sugar-free -
0	6B	i - i 'm -
2	6B	that 'd be a tough one to cut .
2	3I	yeah , next to the deck chairs , and you have trunc all that stuff out on your deck . face cream . that was gon na be like , here .
0	6B	and we 've got uh -
2	3I	so here , stick those back in here .
1	6B	they 've already been there . yeah . keep it around . i dunno .
1	3I	liters of water . i would -
2	6B	um . additional bus stops . since they 're cutting our bus services right and left maybe we do n't need additional stops .
2	6B	uh pest control , i think i might be w-
2	6B	which would be great , but why is the city trunc
1	6B	i 'd rather have more bus upkeep , than the fishing licenses .
0	3I	he likes borscht .
2	3I	half-inch tubing , i 'm just gon na put that with - yeah , yeah yeah yeah .
0	6B	i 'll look it up .
1	6B	public bus upkeep , sounds good . drainage ditches also sounds good .
2	6B	uh . we ca n't get rid of the subway system that we do n't have . we can not get rid of wish we had one .
1	3I	so it says .
1	6B	mm-hm , hospital additions .
2	6B	i think we 're really in agreement about football equipment .
0	6B	yes . um , junior soccer league .
2	6B	i thought that - i thought that the cable companies were actually obligated to underwrite that or to pay for that .
1	3I	so right trunc right underneath the cake mix in the right of the store .
2	3I	either that or we just loaded up this one .
2	6B	and public news station .
0	3I	oatmeal .
0	3I	toothpaste .
1	3I	i 'm gon na put heavy cable over here .
2	6B	yeah . it 's actually a huge service .
1	6B	we might as well just go on down to public health too .
0	3I	non-refrigerated food items , toiletries , trunc clothing type stuff .
1	3I	yeah oh yeah , that 's good . socks . oh , more -
1	3I	a non- trunc thank you . a non-disposable .
2	3I	next to our - yeah , next to cord-y thingies .
0	6B	license from that county .
2	6B	i 'd like to keep it but at the same time - publicly funded -
2	6B	kitten and puppy adoption is handled voluntarily by , like , paws and -
2	6B	no that 's important .
1	3I	stoves . do you wan na put it over with , like , all the outdoor stuff ?
1	6B	what about hospital additions ? i know that 's important but -
2	6B	i think that 's important . um , to keep -
1	6B	i do n't know what to make of it .
1	3I	we need canned beets . yes .
2	3I	yeah . we only messed up a little bit cuz of the overpopulation here .
1	6B	yeah , yeah . like , maybe , maybe wait a little bit . um , needle exchange , i think that 's really important . um -
1	6B	or keep one of the other things in favor of the football stadium upkeep .
1	3I	staples , i think .
1	3I	i 'd have to say over here .
1	6B	of one thing -
1	3I	and , let me see , small axes go up with this stuff here .
1	3I	yeah , do n't really have any - i guess there 's books . we could put it by that , maybe .
2	3I	yeah . that 's right . which would go like here ? trunc oh , cake mix . that 's there .
1	3I	tools ! yeah . we 'll put it there .
1	6B	oh that - oops .
1	3I	well , that should go there too .
1	3I	where should we put our alcohol ?
2	3I	um , well , in a - in a - i 'm thinking , in a real grocery store , would n't the shoelaces be in , like , this kind of an area ?
2	3I	alright , if we think it 's a tiny portable one , then maybe we want it next to , like , travel guides ? but , like , on the other side . so this is , like , fishing and then camping .
1	6B	what about acting coaches ?
1	6B	what about acting coaches ?
1	3I	oh , yeah . yeah , yeah .
0	6B	okay . um . sugar free juice machines .
1	6B	do - i mean we can always put it back - let 's say community news goes .
2	3I	cuz that was there . yeah .
1	3I	how bout mint toothpaste ?
1	3I	beets here .
0	3I	yeah , we had cereal up here , but , uh -
0	3I	do you think we 'll have shoes ?
1	6B	so we start with education and programs ?
2	6B	oh yeah , that one was fun .
1	3I	oh . good .
2	6B	i think you have to have em .
1	3I	ah , it was the tow rope . so we put heavy cable down .
0	6B	reproductive education , okay .
0	6B	help you find a house . it 's just you at your house .
1	3I	and if they do n't not understand it we 'll explain it .
2	6B	it 's not like we 're cutting s-
1	3I	that 's probably -
1	6B	oh , i see , i see , i see .
2	6B	what - trunc i 'll tell you what they 're thinking about . they 're thinking about certificates of need for hospital beds .
2	6B	you know how much money they do n't spend on some of the other things . like they do n't have art teachers , and some of them do n't have music teachers , until you 're in high school .
0	3I	so , i have toilet paper , heavy cable , and books of matches .
1	3I	heavy cable . sure . go with it .
0	6B	what about -
2	3I	and then all the sporting and outdoor and hardware stuff . yeah ! i think we 've got it .
1	3I	yeah , yeah . that makes sense .
2	3I	alright . i 've got some electric heaters . which , that seems to go hand and hand with the power cords . so i 'm gon na put that right underneath the power cords .
1	6B	yeah . i think you 're right , so that goes out .
1	6B	yeah , hopefully - see there you could make the invasive species go into weed control just like you could have the -
1	3I	our buckets were right here stick trunc by the peat moss .
2	6B	yeah ! just like so many cats . it was - crazy . anyway so yeah it 's important . we should keep that .
1	6B	we have to sort of know what kind of a county we are in . is this a county like seattle , where - like king county where many city that provide services or are we - is it a county like - ?
0	3I	uh - egg timers ?
2	3I	more food , and then the
2	6B	yeah , do n't we have - i mean , dog catcher typically has been a public -
2	6B	oh that 's right , we cut the drama coaches so -
2	6B	but they 're of the same nature .
1	6B	we keep that .
1	6B	well that could also be girls and boys , whereas this is - football 's just boys .
1	6B	maybe in a real scenario they do . i dunno , i feel very uneducated . yeah .
1	6B	yeah . or - or too much woe . um -
1	3I	i would put that with the soybeans .
0	3I	cans of peas
1	6B	trunc trunc and leave the other ?
0	6B	um . so i mean it 's already there . it 's already getting funded . um .
0	6B	how many are there ? there are three , six , nine .
2	6B	screw em .
1	6B	mm-kay what 's - ? what do we not have to have on there ?
1	3I	you take a couple .
0	6B	the massage , the flag pole , the taxi stops the fishing licenses . so that was nine , so we can add back three things .
0	3I	i imagine like the big red dixie cups you see the college kids drinking trunc out of .
0	3I	the thing is - is you have cake mix .
1	3I	kay . i 've got some cushions for deck chairs . um those are -
1	6B	good point . good point .
1	6B	well we 're just looking for discussion points and looking at the smallest list .
1	6B	yeah , cuz then trunc what if you have , like , a - ?
2	3I	let 's - let 's change this . let 's put the - this one down here by the pet food .
1	6B	trunc it is n't that way , but trunc assuming they all equally got the same amount of money .
1	3I	this area ?
1	3I	this area .
1	3I	this area ?
1	3I	this area .
2	6B	i do n't know . actually , i live in new york -
1	3I	light trunc oh , clothing . we were just figuring out about clothing . yeah , okay . yeah .
1	3I	scissors next to tweezers ?
2	3I	okay , so . this is kinda trunc electric heaters . do you know what i wan na do ? i wan na put electric heaters with this .
2	6B	we need to - we do n't want a lot of stray cats . i mean , we wan na stop the -
1	3I	fleece lined boots . well i 'd put that here -
2	3I	yep , i trunc i was - yeah , i completely agree .
2	6B	well , it 's just additions .
1	6B	but we could so without em for awhile .
0	6B	sure . okay . well -
2	6B	math tutor .
0	6B	oh really ? did you have the vaccination ?
1	6B	trunc yes . yeah trunc yeah .
2	3I	light jackets ! perfect !
1	3I	mm-hm . and knives too , box knives .
1	3I	yeah . that makes sense . books of matches .
1	3I	yeah . next to ice cream .
1	3I	clearly from the same tree .
2	3I	yeah , but they do n't have any - they do n't have anything like it .
1	6B	that would be an issue .
2	3I	i will put those -
2	6B	look , you got stray cat spraying , and baby and kitten puppy adoption and the veterinary hospital .
1	6B	on those , right ?
2	3I	and then i also have thick sweaters , which i 'd put near the heavy coats .
1	6B	oh , well there 'd be a human crying out .
2	6B	hold off . i - would n't think that most hospitals are working at full capacity trunc full holding capacity right now , right ?
2	3I	yeah , it 's weird . it was weird walking from - yeah .
0	6B	what did we have over here ?
1	3I	yeah , that 's a good idea .
1	3I	yeah . that 's a good idea .
0	3I	um trunc trunc are those , like , exercise weights ? is that what they mean ?
1	6B	pay
1	6B	trunc we 'll set up - we 'll set up neighborhood -
2	3I	i dunno , mouse traps . it 's kinda just like random -
1	3I	and this is sort of domestic stuff .
1	3I	i 'm thinkin maybe over here .
1	6B	needle exchange ? yes . sex offender database ?
1	3I	fishing net . next to boating ?
0	3I	foil aisle .
1	3I	sticks of butter . that goes -
1	3I	clothes up here .
2	6B	alright that 's our trunc our - our final answer there valerie .
2	6B	oh god keep the teaching certificates .
1	6B	could go .
1	3I	could go -
1	6B	yeah . yeah , that 's true .
2	3I	yeah . we could do that . let 's do that .
1	3I	definitely .
1	3I	definitely .
1	6B	definitely .
1	6B	definitely .
1	3I	definitely .
1	3I	definitely .
1	3I	the random -
2	6B	and , um , you could n't find someone who was qualified -
1	3I	do these things just - ?
0	3I	i do n't know if we can reposition to make more space . oh , that 's legal or not but -
1	3I	yeah , that sounds - that sounds good .
3	6B	i 'm a - i 'm a major animal advocate so i 'm not so sure about that but - but yes , when it comes down to this . but -
1	6B	yeah . if we cut acting coaches . which is fine with me . cut the acting coaches . and then -
2	3I	camping backpack . do it .
2	6B	you know , like trunc like we had over here . but , because we took two here , we got ta take two here . so now what we hafta do is -
0	6B	where did you see hospital additions ?
2	6B	i have never heard of a taxi stop .
1	3I	pouches of oatmeal and then dried figs -
1	6B	at least - pretty much . i think my dad 's - my dad has done stuff like that . so -
2	6B	yeah so . cut that for now , come up with something else later .
1	6B	maybe taxi stops ? i do n't r-
2	3I	i 've got some backpacks . which go great with loose leaf paper .
1	3I	it looks as though this -
0	6B	they get funds .
0	3I	shoelaces again !
1	3I	half-inch tubing and all that stu-
1	3I	it 's always good when i find one that 's - that 's obvious .
1	6B	yeah , that would - that would make sense . if we 're gon na trunc do hunting , to do the fishing .
2	3I	face cream would be considered a toiletry .
2	3I	do we have any other - oh bottles of juice ! there we go .
1	3I	for boating , or - ? yeah . okay .
0	3I	loose leaf paper , still .
1	6B	housing assistance is good .
1	6B	i do n't know . uh , the food bank needs - yeah , junior soccer league -
1	3I	cans of peas , probably go next to soybeans ? large vests .
1	3I	i do n't - i ca n't move it once i put it up .
2	6B	i would think you could get rid of the - of taxi stops .
1	3I	since there is no other exercise equipment , i 'm willing to go with the second definition .
0	3I	was n't there - ? we do n't have bread yet ?
2	6B	job training , that would be important .
0	6B	and bookkeeping . so there are six things now that we have got off of there .
1	3I	this is going to be -
1	6B	yeah , it 's already privatized for the most part .
1	3I	kay , so we 've got the thick sweaters .
0	6B	invasive species removal , s_t_d_ education , toxic waste disposal , hospital additions -
1	3I	it 's true . i do n't want the beets to be lonely .
1	6B	it 's , uh -
0	3I	trunc trunc what 'd you do with the -
1	3I	arranged them - ?
2	3I	yes , yes .
1	6B	maybe hunting tags . i mean in some ways - i mean i - that 's more of a day i wan na - i wan na have .
1	3I	so , first out of the truck . what do we have ? let 's do hats .
2	6B	i would let go .
2	6B	yes . let 's call that public bus upkeep , and we can drop towing services .
2	6B	kay , speed limit signs . need that . right ?
1	3I	probably more like um -
0	3I	packages of cookies .
0	3I	packages of cookies .
0	3I	packages of cookies .
0	3I	packages of cookies .
0	3I	packages of cookies .
2	6B	yeah . the only thing about acting coaches - if it said , like , drama teacher , i would say no no no , keep it . but , like , for me , when i see the word coach , i think of , like -
2	3I	it sounds like we need to create another section .
2	3I	that 's a baking section and this is finished food , like ice cream . yeah this is the guilty pleasure one . that 's right .
1	3I	okay , how bout there ? okay .
0	3I	okay , so looking at these items -
1	3I	hm . we do n't really have -
1	6B	yeah , i 'm not either .
2	6B	like a - okay , so definitely that one . hospital additions ?
1	3I	yeah . and - yeah . there we go .
1	6B	so , we have n't gotten rid of anything yet , have we ?
2	6B	any government service .
1	6B	oh yeah . i - i - i think math tutors is -
1	6B	the football stadium and the veterinary hospital ?
0	3I	bars of soap .
0	3I	bars of soap .
0	3I	bars of soap .
0	3I	bars of soap .
0	3I	bars of soap .
0	3I	bars of soap .
0	3I	bars of soap .
0	3I	bars of soap .
0	3I	bars of soap .
1	3I	should we put it on this side ?
2	3I	oh , nice . you called it ! you called it .
1	6B	pothole maintenance too . oh
2	6B	i do n't think we need that .
1	3I	here . i 'm not sure .
2	6B	those - yeah those - those things - yeah . those - those are already up there .
1	6B	and they - and the cars are n't drivable ?
0	3I	have an egg timer there .
1	3I	i think we got it .
0	3I	mm yeah .
1	6B	i trunc i do n't think so , i - i think you -
0	6B	i do n't know how much -
0	6B	there was in one of our other exercises , there was a reference to public news station . i was n't -
2	3I	maybe . i mean , we still have the -
2	3I	i 'm good with it .
1	3I	that 's camping , maybe , is it ? or is it more - ?
1	3I	i think so , yeah . loose-leaf - mm-hm .
1	6B	they can go online . they can read a book . it 's not necessarily a social activity .
1	6B	that was easy .
1	6B	i would let those go , maybe .
1	6B	i do n't know why we would have to certify masseuses
0	3I	and backpacks .
1	3I	next to empty plastic jugs ?
2	3I	i think this would be kind of in the construction area , but close to siding .
2	6B	for better or for worse , there 's far more tattoo parlors in town than there are hunters , probably .
1	3I	these should go together .
0	6B	mm kitten and puppy adoptions .
1	3I	but , kinda with the buckets an-
0	3I	trunc where are the tweezers ? uh -
2	6B	um . note takers , disability services um those trunc maybe fall under special ed teachers .
0	3I	a little . cheat a little .
1	3I	trunc household ? like , toilet , by - kinda by toilet paper , maybe ?
0	6B	that 's all we need two more . oh . um .
2	6B	trunc my only question on boating licenses is whether there 's any revenue source for the counties out of - like , when you - when you -
1	3I	yeah , it goes up there . yeah . yeah .
1	3I	well , how about putting it over there then ?
2	3I	so i would look so - trunc right here there 's - this looks like baking stuff to me . but i normally would have sugar in the baking stuff but i 'm not allowed to .
1	3I	what are you thinking ?
2	6B	either the fishing or the tattoos . for where we are , for the trunc the metropolitan area . for urban areas . okay . we do n't need the fishing licenses so much .
2	6B	alright . that 's our final answer . poetry books and sugar free juice machines .
2	3I	let 's - we 're gon na have school supplies in this area .
2	6B	or to remove ? or to remove that one ? cuz they 're sorta the same thing . this is - this is like -
2	6B	public services - i still have my eye on that stadium .
1	6B	sweet ! okay .
1	3I	dairy ?
1	3I	dairy .
2	6B	cuz we do n't actually have to resolve these issues .
2	6B	this could - yeah . for public health concerns , we probably should keep it .
1	3I	see large cups could go down -
1	3I	so that seems to be a home item .
2	6B	yeah . uh we 're not going to cut sex ed . that is a bad idea .
2	3I	uh , well how about . yeah . near the whiskey . okay .
1	3I	next to boxes of doughnuts ?
2	6B	what is it - sex ed and reproductive education ? same thing .
1	3I	maybe around here ?
1	3I	maybe around here ?
0	6B	so we 've got one .
0	6B	so we 've got one .
1	6B	cut it .
1	6B	cut it .
2	3I	oh , excellent excellent .
1	6B	so , it sounds like we 're going to postpone and currently cut the football equipment and the sugar free juice machines .
0	6B	acting coaches , poetry books , special ed teachers , cooking classes , note takers for disability services -
2	6B	okay , so then we 'd have both the public access station and public news station . that 's fine .
2	6B	oh , they are , but they 're not usually -
1	6B	reducing blight . so i guess that a - a luxury in - in a way .
0	3I	um , where 'd we say uh , toiletries ?
1	3I	would that be trunc . yeah .
0	6B	public access station , reusable bag campaign -
2	3I	although they could be used at home for trunc okay . okay .
2	6B	um . lady and the tramp ? you 're probably thinking ? god . trunc that was awful . awful . i would - i would like , start -
1	6B	yeah , that 's pretty much all the -
1	6B	and dog catcher ?
1	3I	i have some dried figs . those are - kinda produce-y - so i 'll put those with the - underneath the beets with the soy beans .
1	3I	cuz we are co-managers at this imaginary store .
1	3I	put that with the eggs .
1	3I	maybe they 're heavy duty scissors .
2	6B	mm-kay . for funding . well , we only need to choose two .
2	3I	wow , that 's really specific .
0	6B	flag pole repair , taxi stops .
1	3I	large cups would go -
0	6B	sugar free juice machines , bookkeeping classes -
0	3I	they had office things sorta around where -
3	6B	and then we have zero calories instead of , you know , like some artificial juice .
1	3I	that would be down here , right ?
0	6B	running around , yeah .
2	6B	and we 're just gon na assume that everybody got it then ?
1	6B	yeah . i think that 's pretty important .
2	6B	yeah , i think that 's true because there are any number of sources for that money . um .
1	6B	right , and it 's not on par with these other things . yeah , that would -
1	6B	in your house . uh . so , what are we cutting ?
1	3I	is there deserts ? yeah . and actually these are - are already prepared and and this is -
1	6B	bus stops , that is a transportation function of -
2	6B	oh , not puppies though .
1	3I	right here next to packages of cookies ?
2	6B	that 's the worst case scenario .
1	3I	trunc trunc i would put that with the , kinda , dairy section .
0	3I	be associated .
1	3I	what do we got ? .
1	6B	oh ! we were gon na get rid of towing services ?
2	6B	i 'd rather keep the soccer league , cuz it sounds like it 's for everyone .
2	6B	no , we trunc we should keep that .
0	6B	towing services , flag pole repair , taxi stops -
0	6B	what fun .
1	6B	well , you know they 're not always -
1	6B	yeah . that 's just a - on the list . no , nothing else .
1	3I	because i 'm thinking what else would go in that category ?
0	3I	i trunc
2	6B	i think that could be towards the bottom of the priority list , though .
1	6B	yeah . yes , down . um -
1	3I	and empty plastic jugs . this is one i -
3	6B	just cuz there 's not a lot of - football stadium upkeep ! let 's get rid of that .
2	3I	i trunc i 'd put it over on this - the right side , but -
1	3I	yeah . and i just wanted to check and make sure that - yes . this is good so we still have all the -
1	3I	so we 'll just start a new one right down here with the mousetraps ? yeah , heavy coats .
0	6B	acting , as in drama coaches .
1	6B	i think all those are useful -
2	3I	let 's put the shoelaces and the hats together because those are -
1	3I	right ? right there ? okay with sugar and pouches of oatmeal .
1	6B	yeah , i guess we would have to - we would have to add both - back both junior soccer and basketball if we were gon na add one we would probably have to add back the other because then somebody would be -
1	3I	i do n't really know .
0	3I	and then i 've got loose leaf paper .
1	3I	that 's what i thought . trunc magnets , yeah .
1	6B	and we do n't have anybody pressuring us .
1	3I	i did n't either .
1	6B	not as important .
1	6B	do you wan na read them ? just for -
1	3I	trunc thinking -
1	6B	alright , let 's pick one list and go through it and decide -
2	3I	or maybe next to - yeah , we can do that .
2	6B	oh , for pete 's sake .
2	3I	empty plastic jugs , let 's put it next to that maybe .
1	6B	specially the fishing licenses , but they are n't having us combine things . they 're asking us what we can get rid of .
2	6B	and by other agencies , like the boys and girls club , so let 's take out the junior soccer league , and the boys basketball club .
2	3I	so , it 's a general store , i thought , we were shaping .
1	3I	let 's - let 's do one at a time . socks -
1	6B	yeah , it 's like a -
1	6B	anyway . should we , like - i guess go through each ?
2	6B	job training programs should stay . chicken pox vaccinations should -
1	3I	they 're not really blunt weapons .
1	3I	like a toiletry product , and then like a household product .
1	3I	it goes with , uh - that 's refrigerated , is n't it ?
2	6B	oh , i think that 's probably good .
1	3I	maybe just way up here .
1	6B	kitten puppy adoption , to me is -
2	6B	would seem like that 's a trunc a lower priority .
1	3I	yeah , i 'm say , cuz boating - yeah , so boating supplies - trunc trunc trunc pre-cut wood 's probably more - yeah , like outdoor - wherever .
1	3I	how bout there ?
2	6B	not channel nine . it may be that trunc you know channel twenty-seven or something like that ?
1	3I	up to you !
1	6B	probably part of the same as , um -
1	3I	by the - by the boating .
1	3I	bagels . where would you put bread ? bread would be near the -
0	3I	well that 's - that 's sort of a -
1	6B	stays ? yeah . housing assistance , think stays .
1	6B	good job .
0	6B	is that everything ?
2	6B	who would do that on their own . out of their own good will .
1	3I	what if we put the fresh produce aisle on -
1	3I	so we probably want , like , a - yeah . we could put , like , a veggie aisle over here .
0	6B	reducing -
1	3I	oh . and the five pound weights . where 'd ye gon na work out ? yeah . that 's -
1	3I	uh , maybe , let 's say fresh since they do n't say . so -
2	3I	i think that would be a good one . - um , outdoor stuff .
2	3I	right by the heavy cable .
1	3I	yeah , let 's do next to the scissors . middle o-
2	3I	we can always move it .
2	6B	but then that 's four things .
1	6B	you know , in japan -
0	6B	well you have someone help you .
0	6B	hunting , towing or massage .
2	3I	yes . put it next to the axes .
2	3I	so i 'll do that over there . on that side of the store .
1	6B	it 's not super bad . so i do n't know . i 've - have n't read the other ones on the list , so i do n't know .
1	6B	yes . yes . that 's a good idea .
2	3I	okay ! yeah . let 's do that .
1	6B	maybe . okay . poetry books .
1	3I	power trunc trunc trunc cords - with a saw , that kind of trunc trunc where 's household appliances , anywhere ? toys , ice cream -
1	6B	to put -
2	6B	and if they were there already , then it might just be really confusing if you get rid of them all of a sudden .
1	3I	yeah , we 're just making room for one more . empty plastic jugs .
1	3I	the categories , they 're already -
1	6B	alright , so we 're gon na trunc aim for four or five on one of these other lists .
0	3I	well we got less food than i thought .
1	6B	i would - uh - yeah , you 're right . taxi stops we do n't need .
2	3I	well that means they have to trunc trunc restock . oh no . no . we did n't . no . that 's - yeah . right . okay . trunc trunc hats .
1	3I	have cushions while they get their firewood .
1	3I	uh , let 's see . uh , bagels . i 'm presuming we probably put those with food .
1	3I	do you think she knows we 're done ?
2	6B	we can always go back and add more , but - take out more , but right now , we wan na eliminate this ?
1	3I	yeah , next to power cords .
2	6B	you have a drama teacher . so -
1	3I	would you say home depot stuff , or kitchen-y stuff ?
2	6B	hospital additions . you get federal and state money for that .
2	3I	yeah . and , like , have few tools here , maybe .
1	6B	easy potential cuts in education programs to my eye -
2	6B	that 's redundant .
1	3I	underneath the half inch tubing and heavy cable .
1	3I	chocolate cars above ice cream .
0	3I	so looks like we have -
0	6B	is that to keep an eye on massage parlors ?
2	3I	see , i do n't know . when i think about a store , i do n't think about going to -
2	6B	like , the food banks where i grew up -
1	3I	mm , maybe where the cases of whiskey are .
1	3I	or - where is that again ?
1	3I	okay . yeah , that 's a good plan . and um -
1	3I	what if we put them right up here ?
2	3I	that 'd go well with , like , the camping stuff .
2	6B	uh , special ed teachers we kinda need , because that - well - we 'll run into that . math is important .
1	6B	important things .
0	6B	i think that 's th-
1	3I	scissors . um -
2	6B	it 's a controlled substance under federal -
1	6B	myself as well .
1	6B	okay . we 'll keep the other ones .
1	3I	with the sweets ?
1	6B	foodbank yes .
1	3I	got some canvas bags . um . let 's see , where should i put those ?
1	6B	so , what trunc we did come off with the -
1	3I	you - you choose .
2	3I	why do n't we ?
2	3I	now , i feel like this could go - either with clothes or home depot .
1	6B	totally . well -
0	6B	what are -
2	6B	if we had a subway system , we 'd have to maintain that .
1	3I	we just did that . oh , right here . right .
1	3I	yeah , i think that 's good .
1	3I	yeah , i think that 's good .
1	6B	are - i think those are good . yeah .
1	3I	yeah , because -
0	6B	i work with -
1	6B	are they building it at the time .
0	6B	quite sure - or - no , it was public access - public access something .
2	3I	this is - this is little gadgets .
1	3I	uh okay , we 'll put it above the heavy cable .
1	6B	and just - ?
0	6B	think she tried out a few - i know at one point , she was at hertzl .
0	6B	so then math tutors .
2	6B	football stadium ? i would n't , no .
1	3I	boy , our grab and go section and our bathroom section 's filling up fast .
1	3I	fishing net , up with the fish hooks .
2	6B	belong in that -
1	6B	yeah . football equipment ?
1	3I	more trunc shoelaces , socks .
0	3I	so tell me -
2	6B	public access and maybe the -
1	6B	yeah . that 's - that 's -
2	3I	we got a problem with refrigerator magnets .
1	3I	travel and stuff .
1	3I	yeah . looks good .
2	6B	yeah . cuz you can get em online anyway but i - i like to , you know - yeah it 's hard .
2	6B	why is the city paying to certify massage therapists ?
2	6B	disabled people , though , that need to ride busses . i do n't know if that -
2	6B	oh trunc oh . oh ! the bottom one , neighborhood watch support ?
1	6B	that 's three . we need one more .
1	3I	over there with , uh - okay . that 's good . coulda been with power cords , but that 's okay .
1	3I	like up here ? yeah , cuz we have books .
1	3I	uh - just right there , too .
1	6B	yeah , it seems like we could ask the veterinary hospital to take over stray cat spaying .
0	3I	we got ta cook the -
2	3I	it does n't matter to me . oh ! that was exciting .
1	3I	with cake mix and sugar ? right .
0	3I	coats .
1	3I	you want - you want it - you want water to be in the fridge . okay .
1	3I	yeah , this is kinda hardware . and these are toys , travel guides , books .
1	6B	safety measure .
0	6B	keep track of money , maybe ?
1	3I	case of whiskey , grab and go .
0	6B	kay , reproductive education
1	6B	yep yeah .
0	6B	poe-
0	6B	trunc sugar fee juice machines - is that it so far ?
2	6B	there you go . that 's putting the humans first . thank you cynthia .
0	6B	is that like not -
1	6B	oh , yeah . i 'd take out taxi stops .
1	6B	then again , that could fall under the other category .
0	6B	football stadium upkeep ?
0	6B	football stadium upkeep .
2	6B	football equipment . ca n't take away their football .
1	3I	alright . i 've got some buckets . um . where should i put these buckets ? buckets 'll probably go in the utility area so .
1	3I	yeah . those seem to go well .
2	3I	you would n't -
1	3I	beets . i 'm gon na put beets by the soybeans .
2	3I	that 'd be next to eggs .
1	3I	that sounds good .
1	3I	that sounds good .
1	3I	that sounds good .
1	3I	that sounds good .
1	3I	that sounds good .
1	3I	that sounds good .
1	6B	i 'd keep that .
2	6B	potentially . kay . s_t_d_ education . pretty important .
1	6B	is because those are the only two that i see that are even - are even -
2	6B	veterans medical trunc i think that 's important .
1	6B	for -
3	3I	um , for this arrangement we have identified no area for clothing .
1	3I	sweets maybe ? on this side ?
2	3I	more outdoorsy type things , bags of peat moss , you know but five pound weights we could probably put with fishing net
1	3I	and beets .
2	3I	well , that 's all food , though .
2	3I	okay ! let 's put clothes in the middle ?
1	6B	weed control and trunc invasive species removal ? i guess that there are certain things that are considered invasive but there are weeds beyond invasive species .
0	6B	and - recreation public services .
0	6B	i still ca n't really handle it .
1	6B	yeah , we should keep that .
1	6B	yes , that 's important .
1	6B	trunc er , invasive species -
0	6B	okay so -
0	6B	we 've said the trunc valerie , we 've said the words .
1	3I	i hope so , beets are so lonely so often .
0	6B	places where the taxis get to hang out .
1	6B	it 's pretty -
1	6B	yeah , bookkeeping classes .
1	3I	okay i think in mine , it was next to travel guides , but i like it better up here .
2	6B	fishing licenses is state of washington .
2	3I	gosh .
1	3I	that sounds good to me .
1	3I	yeah i do n't think so . um -
0	3I	here we go , bundles of sticks .
0	6B	neighborhood watch , was that the other one ? yes , and keeping veterans .
1	3I	um , is that over - ?
0	6B	yeah , i have .
1	3I	cross some power cords ? i like that yeah .
2	3I	i love trader joe 's , yeah . trunc they 're cheaper than safeway overall . i do n't like trunc and it 's , like , a super small safeway , too , so , trunc they do n't - they do n't even have easy mac , which i thought was really weird . like , it 's a college area and they do n't have super cheap food .
1	3I	yeah , that 's -
0	6B	so what - what have we gotten rid there ? we 've gotten rid of , uh , football -
1	3I	and duct tape ? kay .
0	6B	was it apes - ?
1	3I	like - this could go with it , right ?
0	3I	whisky and ice cream .
1	3I	yeah . liters of water ?
1	6B	i 'm not a huge fan of football equipment .
2	6B	pre-natal checkups , very important . neighborhood watch support , that 's -
0	3I	where did our buckets go ?
0	6B	we put that under s-
1	6B	they would n't -
2	3I	that 's a big section . yeah okay .
2	6B	i tend to , like , favor humans over animals , you know - know so , if it came trunc down to it , i 'd probably choose the soccar league over that one .
1	3I	in that sorta utilities section .
2	6B	i do n't wan na have a whole bunch of cats .
2	6B	i 'm on the fence about this one though . because do you know just ca n't have -
1	6B	that 's not useful .
2	6B	okay . yeah , we can cut one of the animal things . there 's like trunc four of them . okay , infrastructure and licensing . definitely cut speed limit signs . no , i 'm just kidding ! probably not a good idea . um -
1	3I	more outdoors slash home improvement ?
0	6B	recreation and public services .
0	6B	recreation and public services .
0	6B	recreation and public services .
0	6B	recreation and public services .
0	6B	recreation and public services .
2	3I	well , here 's - i mean this is water , right ?
1	6B	food bank , no .
2	6B	i 'd think so especially since it rains so much here . trunc that would make sense . okay , so there 's six .
1	6B	or how bout poetry books and the sugar free juice machines .
1	6B	but you can - start your own private business repairing flag poles .
2	3I	they 're right at - but you know they 're - i know but they 're - see , they 're right across the aisle .
1	6B	that was a joke of the class .
1	6B	there 's a lot of voluntary people enjoy acting .
0	6B	sugar free juice machines
2	6B	music .
1	6B	maybe trunc that 's a maybe ? maybe maybe ?
1	3I	yeah . we 'll pretend it 's fourth of july .
1	3I	so we can start out by , like , taking a few , or do you wan na just talk about how it is first ?
2	6B	scary .
0	6B	taxi stops and , uh , additional bus stops .
1	6B	like a certain species of bees -
1	6B	i agree . yeah .
0	3I	tow ropes . uh -
1	3I	well that makes sense .
1	3I	directly - yes , so that -
1	3I	books of matches would be there .
2	6B	that could be really bad .
2	3I	books of matches . uh , that could go either way .
1	3I	they relate .
1	6B	then sure , you could have acting coaches .
2	3I	the dried figs .
1	3I	dog walkers ? supplies .
1	3I	i think the first question is -
0	3I	that 's toiletries right ? fleece-lined boots .
1	3I	fishing weight !
1	6B	good to know .
1	3I	exercise .
1	6B	oh , we 've done it ?
2	6B	but non - non-profits and , you know , recreation groups do that - that stuff . they get volunteers going .
1	3I	not right next door .
1	6B	the boy 's basketball club ?
2	3I	light jackets . we had heavy jackets before . we 're just gon na wait on that one . cans of peas .
1	3I	sure . why not .
1	6B	the junior soccer league , eh .
0	6B	but i presume public news station is - do you live in seattle proper ?
2	3I	we are gon na need to put clothes somewhere . do we wan na decide - ? that 's a big category that we do n't have represented on here .
2	6B	and if it 's a food safety issue that goes out into the community and beyond and people get sick , then it reflects poorly on our community .
2	6B	community news ad .
1	6B	that could be too .
2	3I	mm , yeah . just keep all the weapons together . yes .
0	6B	and neighborhood watch support .
2	6B	when you - on your job application . it just makes things harder to move on .
2	6B	i had a kid -
2	6B	and since it 's against a federal law -
1	6B	i like the idea of a food bank . um , that 's two . a junior soccar league .
1	3I	so we could put them either near the books where it would -
2	3I	somewhere over in that first aisle , yeah .
1	3I	yeah . like here .
0	3I	face cream below tweezers .
0	3I	light jacket .
0	3I	kay , let 's see .
1	3I	sure , just go for it .
0	3I	half inch tubing .
0	3I	half inch tubing .
0	3I	half inch tubing .
0	3I	half inch tubing .
0	3I	half inch tubing .
0	3I	half inch tubing .
2	6B	right right right . they do n't - trunc they can - they do n't need to be thespians . alright .
2	6B	but if you were in a neighborhood where crime was rampant , you 'd also be - you 'd also be concerned about that .
0	6B	but if you go hunting anywhere do you need a -
0	6B	and prenatal checkups are a larger -
2	3I	not over here . you would n't have that in your garage .
1	3I	are we ?
1	3I	we 've got some , like -
1	6B	what about public news station ?
1	6B	because that 's , uh trunc for water runoff , yeah .
2	6B	uh , trunc uh , trunc uh , what is it , credit union ? uh , you know , that 's all federal regulation , so if they 're at all regulated by the feds in any way , shape , or form -
1	6B	alright . so , number trunc uh , column three , recreation and public services .
1	6B	pothole maintenance . got ta - got ta keep that .
0	6B	p_b_s_ , right ?
1	6B	yeah . i feel trunc may-
2	6B	pest control . well , no that 's like - that 's like rodents and stuff .
1	3I	probably more bathroom .
1	3I	we do n't quite need the heavy jackets yet , so let 's trunc popularize the light jackets .
1	6B	if either .
2	3I	hm , yeah maybe .
1	3I	you sit and read them , you got ta put it in the backpack .
2	3I	that could be like trunc chocolate bars .
0	6B	we do n't need the bus stops . we do n't need the tattoo artists . we do n't need the boating . we do n't need -
1	3I	gosh , trunc it cou-
1	6B	yeah , i definitely would -
2	6B	a school , right ? i mean , if there 's , like , a thousand kids , like -
1	6B	well that 's licensing you 'd have to pass the test , right ? certificate just show that you 've taken a course ?
2	6B	but not poetry and not um -
0	6B	port of seattle .
2	6B	or i 've worked at university for too long . okay .
1	3I	reasonable ? or - ?
0	6B	so then recreation and public services . stray cat spaying -
0	6B	veterinary hospital
1	3I	i dunno that 's kinda hard .
2	6B	chicken pox vaccinations of course . invasive trunc invasive species removal .
1	6B	no , i do n't think so either , no .
1	3I	uh , do we have enough room ?
1	6B	we would be okay with cutting neighborhood watch -
2	6B	the drainage ditches need to stay . um , public bus trunc upkeep .
1	3I	no . we to make an area .
1	6B	i - i - i agree with that , so we 've cut two ? the assist-
2	6B	so we 'll get rid of the speed limit signs .
1	3I	kinda bakery ? or is that candy ? or is that something - something else .
1	3I	yeah , makes sense . yeah .
1	3I	on the opposite side of the self from the sugar ?
2	6B	if it means eliminate - you know we 're gon na have a little n_r_a_ issue i think . and people but - uh .
2	6B	or nor job training programs .
1	3I	empty plastic jugs . that might be the camping stuff , huh ?
1	3I	bottles of juice ? yeah .
1	3I	i 'm thinking -
0	3I	cans of peas , okay .
1	3I	maybe more with the -
1	3I	yes . a whole aisle of things you can hurt yourself with .
1	6B	they trunc they probably -
1	6B	you 're right .
1	3I	you 're right .
0	6B	so we got rid of the towing services , the boys basketball club , the weed control ?
1	3I	cushions for deck chairs . this seems like and outdoor -
2	3I	yeah , there 's nothing like that up here . there 's a lot of space right here . we could make a spot .
1	6B	um , so that 's - that 's three items there .
2	6B	kind of a burden .
1	6B	maybe we were n't clear trunc were we clear enough ?
1	3I	well , it could be -
1	3I	i would be inclined to put it near the mousetraps , paper bags almost ? does that sound reasonable ? alright put that there but give it a little bit of space above the mousetraps .
0	6B	toxic waste disposal , hospital additions .
0	6B	toxic waste disposal , hospital additions -
1	6B	it is for sure let 's see .
2	6B	boy i would n't wan na have this -
1	3I	sure yeah .
3	6B	do we have in this city that we need to have a flag pole repair department ?
2	3I	or wait let 's put it maybe right above there , so that it can kind of go both with - with trunc because vests and sweaters yeah okay .
1	3I	sure . electric heaters .
0	6B	the tattoo artist licenses .
0	3I	um , loose-leaf paper . hm .
2	6B	well , i know , but they - but you have - uh , trunc there is some costs -
1	6B	so hunting tags can stay . subway system -
1	3I	that could go into the baking along with - yeah .
2	6B	no . no . i do n't either .
0	6B	okay , recreation and public services . stray cat spaying .
2	3I	oh , it could go lots of places . um -
0	6B	to keep them in state .
1	3I	um there kay
1	3I	maybe sort of in - down - yeah , kind of in the household hardware .
2	6B	kinda goes into the same as the ones above , so not , um - towing services .
1	3I	bars of soap , uh , with , uh , face cream ?
0	3I	the tweezers .
2	6B	well , that could be - well , maybe we should keep that then . cuz people are learning -
0	6B	sixteen .
2	6B	it 's most - urgent .
1	6B	yeah , okay . good , i 'm glad you told me that .
1	3I	yeah , put it there just in case we uh put something across from duct tape .
1	3I	we 'll start a - yeah , start a - start a new category for a -
0	3I	wetsuits . um here 's some .
1	3I	that would make sense . um .
0	6B	bellevue high .
1	6B	put that -
1	6B	bagel factory inspections . that 's weird .
1	3I	pre-cut wood . rolls of duct tape , they seem like home -
1	6B	uh , cuz i do it on park and - i mean i do it and county .
2	3I	uh uh face cream ! there we go . face cream , bars of soap .
2	6B	no , they just said we had to do the same number .
1	3I	and the saws .
2	6B	uh , we do n't need to expand hospitals at this time .
1	6B	i think you had a good idea , with just privatizing taxi stuff .
2	6B	that 's silly .
1	3I	well now that - that - yeah . that obviously goes over there , near boating supplies .
1	6B	those are easy . okay .
1	3I	could go right - er .
2	6B	soup kitchen 's definitely to keep . housing assistance need to keep . but dog catcher - mm - yeah , i suppose .
1	3I	i guess i 'll - could put it below . i do n't really know if that 's a space up there , anyway .
2	6B	i dunno , i 've like - i went to turkey . full of cats .
1	3I	we have travel guides there , but we have paper over there . so yeah , i would that one , yeah .
1	6B	may not be in seattle .
2	3I	trunc trunc got ta be near here .
1	3I	they could go in any of the - they could go with -
2	6B	um , you could combine the two .
2	6B	b_
0	3I	bottles of water .
1	6B	feel like weed control -
0	6B	but you have to do it .
0	6B	so so far we 've said , um , the invasive - invasive species removal would go -
2	3I	like , within - okay , yeah , cuz i was gon na say , if there were toiletries that were more -
1	3I	backpack could go over there , yeah .
1	6B	the junior soccer league , which while doubtless greatly beloved will not leave anyone hungry on the street if it 's cut .
2	3I	face cream , toilet paper , tweezers right here , right here .
1	3I	so we 'll put the canned peas near the peas , but not right next door .
1	6B	right . right . yeah , that 's a safety kind of issue as well .
1	6B	i 'd say we cut it .
1	3I	maybe the empty plastic jugs and the buckets by the - well these are - i 'm think - yeah i was like - is this - are these the like -
2	6B	the boys can play in the basketball - they find a good cul-de-sac .
0	6B	drainage dishes ?
1	6B	we 're good .
1	6B	we 're good !
0	3I	ice cream , chocolate bars .
1	3I	like , there ?
2	6B	sounds like the other thing . like sex ed and reproductive -
0	6B	i 'm just looking here to see what - see - see what i can see on - on the list where i - where - where i - uh , that i figure -
1	3I	oh yeah that 's right .
1	6B	like , you know -
2	6B	definitely there 's no , um -
1	6B	oh , right . oh , i did that once too .
1	3I	uh - uh , well , camping - yeah . wel we 've got cans of peas . mm-hm .
2	6B	mean , and i do n't know , cuz this is kinda vague , so i do n't know what that 's referring to . but poetry books i think are probably important . for the library . although if you 're gon na cut - should n't you already have your - i mean , they 're not gon na , like , throw the books away . um -
0	6B	did we have - did we have , um -
1	3I	buckets ! i think buckets is solidly home improvement and camping .
2	3I	general store . oh , this goes with bars of soap .
1	6B	and we could , although we have three everywhere else - i think -
2	3I	the same department .
1	6B	what about , um -
1	3I	gee , there 's no clothing up there yet . well -
1	6B	um it could -
1	3I	electric heaters , sure .
1	3I	yeah , put it right there .
1	6B	math tutors are nice .
2	6B	i do n't - mm , cuz like . well - i do n't actually - and i mean if it like -
1	3I	probably trunc yeah , on the same .
1	6B	you know that was - the voters rejected that , right ? well , actually -
0	3I	uh . trunc
1	3I	or here , next trunc
1	6B	mm that 's all contracted out anyhow .
1	6B	i would cut acting trunc i think acting coaches is like drama coaches .
2	3I	that 's okay . in the middle i think . yeah !
1	3I	and then maybe this last aisle we have n't used anything on we could have books . i mean -
2	6B	why do you need a separate area to support ?
0	6B	public access station ? i do n't know what that is .
0	6B	i mean , i know what community news is , but what - ? what do the mean by the ads ?
0	6B	boy 's basketball club , public access station , reusable bag campaign , veterinary hospital , football stadium upkeep and pest control !
2	6B	it 's a lesser thing than a teacher . yeah .
2	6B	definitely need a food bank .
1	3I	well , we had axes , so -
1	3I	hats with clothes .
2	3I	or trunc or one .
0	3I	oh hm .
0	6B	trunc for local -
3	3I	chocolate !
1	3I	yeah , i think that 'd be with the other vegetables .
2	6B	all the tattoo artists not being licensed for obviously healthy reasons and things but -
1	3I	or - ooh , we already put it . i was gon na say by backpacks and books it coulda been good too , but that 's fine .
0	6B	so then , what would be the three , then ?
2	6B	cuz all of them are - you know , the - f_ - trunc if the feds are involved - f_d_i_c insured , or -
2	6B	all these things are pretty trunc important . oh , oh , oh oh , let 's get rid of that .
2	6B	although , i 'd like to keep the juice machines in the long term for health reasons , but i can see -
1	3I	oh , we could - we could kind of generalize about -
1	6B	i trunc i try and be green , but -
1	6B	what are the community news ads ? that 's important .
1	3I	i 'm happy with that like , normally i 'd put that near boating supplies , but whatever .
1	6B	i 'd say that one 's kinda on the fence .
1	3I	we - we know we have cake coming along , so we got ta save space . so here is bars of soap and they need to go with this stuff .
0	3I	we trunc we do n't have magnetics yet ?
1	3I	well that has to go .
2	3I	i wan na put - well -
2	6B	i know . well yeah , yeah , well , the thing is - the thing is , is when you - when you make a bagel , what are you making , you know ? cooked bread .
0	3I	uh . i keep stepping on this .
2	6B	is important . yeah .
0	3I	without looking , i got bagels .
2	6B	well , yeah because otherwise we 're gon na pay for it in trunc you know , that 's expensive .
1	6B	yeah . it 's - it 's uh -
1	6B	we 've got two .
0	3I	and loose-leaf trunc well , whatcha got ?
2	6B	well , if we get a subway system we do n't need these additional bus stops .
1	3I	let 's put it next to the empty plastic jugs .
1	3I	with outdoors ?
1	6B	yeah . that 's something that -
1	6B	the next one we agreed on -
1	6B	okay . so we got - we got -
1	6B	um . i kinda already have that and it 's already -
0	6B	i do n't know if -
1	3I	produce , right .
1	3I	yeah , somewhere .
1	6B	i do n't - i 'm not a big fan of like , hunting and fishing . but i do n't know if that - if my personal , like -
1	3I	shoe laces .
1	3I	super wal-mart .
2	6B	i like - i - i like the arts . yeah . i - for some reason i feel a bit differently about that than cooking classes . cuz i feel like -
0	3I	vests .
0	3I	vests .
1	6B	i was gon na say neighbors do it , we - on their own , yeah . so we 're - we can get rid of that one , ca n't we ? and then we - i 'm happy to get rid of bagel factories . yeah . yeah . so we just have to find one more .
1	3I	that 's hardware .
0	3I	do we have bakery ? we have baking goods .
1	3I	with the buckets and the mouse traps ?
1	3I	do you think we should group the foods together ? should we put the preserve foods differently from the fresh foods ?
1	6B	trunc i would think it trunc trunc maybe , like , a hunting license . i think that 's important . so you do n't , i do n't know .
1	3I	it 's easy .
0	3I	and then , yeah , i have books and scissors .
2	3I	but it 's in the same aisle .
2	6B	in a certain trunc for example , to teach , uh , primary school .
2	6B	i do n't understand why you need a separate -
1	6B	well , let 's get rid of the invasive species removal cuz we 're still going to have weed control .
1	3I	well , not - it 's hard to - hard to say .
0	3I	i do n't really know what that is .
1	6B	boy . i do n't like any of these .
1	3I	yeah , people like dried fruit in their oatmeal .
1	6B	need one more .
0	6B	fishing licenses -
2	6B	we 'll trunc trunc extend the s_t_d_
2	6B	well i think it 's better to just take a five percent cut across the board and let everybody , you know , cut the fat outta their own department . but - the - we 'll go with this .
2	6B	yeah she - she is really - if you do n't regulate that , what happens is it gets - it gets - goes sideways on you pretty fast .
0	6B	special ed teachers , special ed classes -
0	6B	oh , i 've heard - i have heard of that , yeah .
1	6B	i could go with that .
1	3I	i feel like it 's kinda like an outdoorsy thing .
2	6B	alright . boys basketball club . same thing with the junior soccer league .
2	6B	i think our transportation actually runs really well right now .
2	6B	one would hope .
2	6B	one would hope .
2	3I	you know , they 're more - they 're not as centralized , but this is all centralized , so - target trunc yeah so i 'd put em under - yeah . trunc yeah .
1	3I	yeah , you wan na put that on ?
1	3I	or below travel guides .
1	6B	works for me for -
0	6B	soup kitchen housing . yeah .
2	3I	we could put those things together .
2	6B	but what are you gon na do along the highways and stuff ?
2	3I	okay . and this was definitely something around here , right ?
2	6B	they - they 're necessary i think . unless -
1	6B	or is it - ?
1	6B	egg farm regulations , i thought that was state and or federal .
1	3I	okay , but by the tweezers ?
1	3I	i do n't know . they trunc it could creep into toys .
1	6B	is that okay ? alright . that 's our three .
2	6B	they 're all useful .
2	3I	no . but - we could have it -
2	6B	but everything else is very important .
1	3I	yeah , an-
1	3I	yeah maybe we should put it with the other um -
2	6B	particularly with math .
2	6B	if they 'll do it .
1	3I	and liters of water - where 'd we put the tweezers ? up there .
2	6B	fishing licenses , keeping the buses up , and keeping the drainage ditches in good repair , that all seems very -
1	6B	were -
2	6B	i mean , when i was in school they did n't have it . i do n't think they really need it !
2	6B	that 's - that 's good . it like feeds -
1	6B	on the second thing , our final answer is invasive species removal -
0	6B	if they need a -
0	3I	uh , what did we ?
1	3I	backpacks and books . maybe by toys or by travel guides .
1	3I	i think mousetraps .
1	3I	oh , that should be , like , um - scissors , and tweezers , and -
2	6B	trunc oh . reproductive education is probably for moms . expecting mothers .
3	6B	trunc i really do n't think so . in - in hind - i mean , i really think that that 's a red herring kind of thing , because it 's so trivial in the trunc in the budget of an education program .
1	3I	on the little siding next to the eggs .
1	3I	yeah , it 's definitely an outdoor thing .
2	3I	now , it should have it 's own section . i mean , really .
0	3I	i - i -
1	3I	back in trunc household ?
1	3I	okay . oh , here 's camping stuff .
1	6B	i think so . yeah , i think that 's less important . i -
1	6B	we want to start eliminating from each column . do you have a sense of that , or what would your approach be ?
1	6B	taxis should be paying for it in any case , cuz they 're a private business , right ?
0	6B	i was thinking like a community bulletin or something .
1	3I	fleece-lined boots . to go with the socks and thick sweaters .
1	3I	they have a trunc part of the store where it 's refrigerated , and a part in a store where it 's not .
0	3I	so , i 'd - okay , boxes of donuts , okay .
2	3I	eggs ? or -
1	3I	by the wood ?
1	6B	i 'd say let 's cut funding for the acting coaches . just for a little bit and see how things do . see if there 's a complete fallout of society .
0	6B	does it have to be where you live ? or does it have to be from where you 're going ?
2	6B	no , i do n't think it is , because we have veterinary hospitals that are private .
1	3I	that looks good there , yeah .
2	6B	in my mind , the things that you can learn yourself at home -
1	6B	hold on to it for a few years .
0	3I	um , soap , face cream , mint toothpaste .
1	6B	alright , so we 're looking for two items out of this list .
1	3I	the famous egg timers .
2	3I	sounds right to me yep .
0	3I	uh , dried figs .
2	3I	always hate shopping in a new store cuz i do n't know where anything is and it takes forever to find the stuff you need .
1	3I	it 's kind of - ice cream , eggs , this sweet -
2	3I	cuz trunc oh , we have the pre-cut wood here , too , so that 's good .
1	3I	go in - go in here ? yeah .
2	6B	trunc i support it .
1	3I	backpacks , probably the same ish spot ?
1	6B	yep . boys basketball club .
0	6B	oh well . toxic -
2	6B	uh hhh .
2	6B	it 's not necessary .
0	6B	they give tests to people . and if they come up positive for something there 's a whole army of these little - public health cars that park in my parking garage .
1	3I	or in between here ?
0	6B	i do n't really know what that is , but -
1	6B	definitely want a good teaching infrastructure .
1	6B	and hospital additions .
2	3I	yeah . or - or fishing ! or trunc it could go trunc right here . cuz y-
2	6B	especially if you 're looking at -
2	3I	beets ? food .
1	3I	maybe by the boating . by the - trunc below to tow ropes .
1	6B	you need the chicken pox .
0	3I	um , mint toothpaste .
1	3I	yeahokay .
2	6B	did n't we have that ?
2	6B	prenatal check-ups , and neighborhood watch support , those all seem important .
2	6B	well . they already doing all the food banks .
2	3I	and heavy coats i 'll just put down here with the clothing i think i can make that executive decision bagels that 's pretty good for you is that , or do you think it ought to be over there with the donuts ? they 're the same shape .
1	3I	and here 's some - some , um -
1	6B	yeah . even though i was an athlete , like all through college and high school ,
2	6B	so we can get rid of one or the other .
1	3I	loose leaf paper . where did we put the scissors ?
2	3I	i 'm not even gon na consult with you .
1	3I	oh , i do too . grew up on it .
1	6B	are sorta -
2	6B	trunc pest control over something else . pest control does n't seem like a -
1	3I	yeah , i think so . yeah .
2	3I	well i think -
0	6B	um , but i never really went .
2	3I	yeah , i 'd probably put it over there . , well , power cords .
2	6B	i mean maybe you had trunc school play and the english teacher kinda was the director and -
2	6B	or trunc i think we 've agreed on that .
0	6B	that 's a little further down . yeah . those -
1	6B	alright . so here we go .
1	3I	i do too .
1	6B	i do too .
1	6B	i do too .
1	6B	i do too .
2	6B	we also could consider neighborhood watch support . are you - ?
1	3I	yeah . this is , like , bulk cooking .
0	3I	small -
2	6B	i wonder if there 's a way to involve all of them .
2	3I	i think it 's kinda separate , but -
1	3I	across from the refrigerated section .
1	6B	i feel like is - you should keep .
2	3I	yeah , dairy-ish so -
2	3I	got some cans of peas next . so peas are trunc small green circular things . i 'll put those with the soy beans .
1	3I	related .
0	3I	trying to think , by -
0	3I	boy this looks like a different -
0	6B	housing assistance ?
1	6B	yeah . no more boys basketball club .
1	3I	bottles of juice . that should be pretty easy , huh ?
2	3I	put it in this section .
1	3I	nice . perfect .
0	6B	where 's our screen ?
0	6B	it 's just a matter of - oh , i can feel a sneeze coming .
1	6B	okay . issues .
1	3I	would n't put it by any of this .
1	3I	so near the power cords , but not too close .
1	6B	that 's - that 's probably good .
0	6B	is that even something that still exists ?
0	6B	um , okay . so we have soup kitchens .
1	6B	okay , i think the public access station .
2	6B	i can get rid of the football equipment and the sugar free , at least on the first cut .
0	6B	yep . got our five there ? okay .
0	6B	now , tattoo artist licenses -
0	6B	and taxi stops . so , these four .
2	6B	subway system . i mean it all depends on what it is but that 's -
0	6B	we got - oh . and we got rid of - neighborhood watch so there 's seven .
0	6B	u_ dub broadcasts some lectures or something . maybe it 's like that .
2	6B	veterinary hospital . why would we have to be supporting the veterinary hospital if we 're supporting the spaying and neutering ?
2	3I	or do you think they should be in the boating ?
0	6B	yeah , weed control .
2	3I	bottles of juice . ah , hate to do that , but i think this -
1	3I	yeah , let 's put down there .
0	6B	taxis .
0	3I	bundles of sticks .
0	3I	bundles of sticks .
0	3I	bundles of sticks .
0	3I	bundles of sticks .
0	3I	bundles of sticks .
0	3I	bundles of sticks .
0	3I	bundles of sticks .
1	6B	yes , good . i 'm glad you agree on that .
1	3I	would think maybe in this quadrant here ? okay .
1	3I	fishing net up by boating supplies ?
2	6B	okay , so , let 's trunc let 's cut - if we hafta cut two things , let 's cut sugar-free juice machines . if that 's okay with you .
1	3I	like , start with toys ?
1	3I	maybe the cups ?
2	6B	honestly -
2	6B	well then , you know , the toxic waste disposal fall in federal too .
0	3I	it looks like we 're done .
3	6B	because i think - no , i think that 's fine . the sugar-free juices . and i - what it stands for , but i think all the moms can pack sugar-free juice if they need to .
0	6B	okay , so we had -
2	3I	oh yeah ! yeah yeah , yeah that sounds good .
1	3I	kay , so -
1	6B	special ed teachers are good .
2	6B	you 're very thoughtful person .
1	6B	yeah . okay . okay . that sounds good .
2	3I	well , this could be here .
2	6B	well we need to keep it until it 's done .
1	6B	um . maybe keep the public access trunc ugh - access in favor of the football ?
1	3I	those go underneath the -
2	3I	five-pound weights , i think that 'd be good for fishing , too .
2	6B	we could cut - trunc we trunc yeah , w-
1	3I	well we 've got -
2	3I	or magnets . yeah like , alls the random things you have in your house .
1	3I	and those are -
0	6B	reusable bag and football .
2	6B	let 's trunc let 's see the most important for me i guess would be sex ed . keep it .
2	3I	okay . cuz i was trunc so boots and socks , those would go all together . i 'm wondering whether we need - whether we want any more space here for -
1	3I	electric heaters . yeah .
0	3I	do it yourself .
0	6B	medical assistance
1	3I	we need to create our own little clothing trunc where would you like to put the clothing section in this store ?
1	3I	probably next , boxes of donuts ?
3	3I	sharp objects . next to the small axes . yes !
1	3I	we do n't have to be -
1	3I	oh , the dairy , yes . you 're - kay . cases of whiskey . i spose that 's kinda -
0	3I	do you remember ?
1	3I	uh , it could either be desserts , like ice cream , or it could be by cake .
0	6B	alright . mm .
2	6B	that 's - that would be my preference . um , just if i 'm looking for -
0	3I	thick sweaters . where was -
1	6B	alright , we 'll keep speech therapy .
1	6B	yeah , or we could just look and - and um like she said , you know , if there 's some things that seem -
2	6B	that just screams .
2	3I	pouches of oatmeal . i 'd put that with the - with the cake mix .
0	3I	alright . i 've got some tweezers .
0	6B	shows and stuff .
1	6B	i - i think you 're right .
2	6B	good liberals that we are .
1	6B	well , i - i would just think that we could just start in the first column trunc look to see what we think are important .
2	6B	it 's usually very weird .
0	3I	um , pouches of oatmeal .
1	3I	and small axes , maybe next to small saws ?
1	3I	oh , or here . with - okay .
1	3I	um , by eggs , maybe ?
2	6B	the trunc sugar free juice .
1	6B	okay . recr-
1	6B	supports all the neighborhood watches .
2	6B	you 're right . i did n't think about it that way , so .
2	3I	oh , look ! here 's something to go with it . fishing net , yay !
1	6B	that 's tough . cuz i trunc that 's an important one .
1	3I	these are all gon na be -
2	6B	so that - boy , i really hate cutting that - the -
0	3I	interesting . okay . oh , box knives .
1	6B	yes . speed limit signs ? yes .
0	3I	nah
2	6B	they might be two different , you know , programs doing that .
1	6B	because they have football .
2	6B	organize themselves , and then you could put that over to another agency .
2	6B	right , it 's a contracted thing . so that 's not part of any public service .
1	6B	you think so too ?
2	6B	oh , i would choose the bus - yeah , a private service . so i would pick the more - oh yeah , did n't even - i should read all these first . um .
1	6B	uh , acting coaches we - we got rid of them .
1	3I	roles of duct tape .
1	3I	end of the aisle in the cutting things section . alright . in home supplies , near axes and scissors .
1	3I	non -
1	3I	take another batch .
1	3I	so i will put them next to the gas powered cookstoves . um -
2	6B	and the public access station . is n't that redundant , kind of ?
2	3I	this one 's to be made , and this is finished . yeah maybe this is - we 'll do that . let 's yeah , exactly .
2	3I	then thinking we should go toward feet .
1	3I	those go here .
3	3I	along with boxes of donuts ! yes .
2	3I	with the - yeah , i 'll put it beneath the bottles of juice , because -
1	6B	trunc uh - public , uh , news trunc so you would cut that . okay .
1	3I	yeah , just put the flags up there . yeah , okay .
1	3I	it 'll be on the end .
2	3I	i think it looks pretty good like that .
1	3I	boating supplies . i agree .
1	3I	and the soy beans - it does n't say dry . well let 's just stick em there . yeah . we 're good enough .
1	6B	would be more important than -
1	6B	well let 's take them in groups .
0	3I	like a box cutter ?
2	6B	disease control .
2	3I	buckets . goes with the siding .
1	3I	somewhere .
1	6B	and then what else , do we think we could do ? additionally bus stops ?
1	3I	boy that could be in a bunch a different place .
1	3I	fine .
2	6B	soup kitchens , i 'd probably keep . but i 'm kind of against them , but i think , you know , at certain times of the year we have to trunc do something .
1	3I	i wan na put em above large vests .
2	6B	sounds ruthless , but veteran 's medical assistance , cuz i do n't think it should be in our budget .
2	3I	no , i think it should go in the food aisle .
0	3I	so let 's see here .
1	6B	you know , the neighbors can watch without county money .
1	3I	near the shoelaces ?
1	6B	there 's already football equipment .
0	6B	ball club , and public access station ? which the cable guys 'll do .
1	3I	yeah somewhere over there . sure .
1	6B	i would trunc i do n't know , i would probably cut -
1	6B	let 's do what ? public health ?
1	6B	sex trunc football equipment .
1	6B	job-training programs ? i would say yes .
1	3I	so , liters of water here ?
2	6B	gender neutral . yeah .
1	3I	yeah , these are trunc this is , like , fresh stuff over here .
0	3I	i got heavy -
3	6B	well , you know , you have a good point because it could be - preventing pregnancies .
2	3I	goes with the peas .
2	6B	sugar free juice machines , that seems , like , a little non-essential . um -
2	3I	to sticks of butter , and eggs . mm-kay , let 's see .
3	3I	oh yes ! right there ! excellent . excellent . alright , beets . that goes down here with soy beans . okay .
1	6B	trunc well , then we 'd like that . well , could we agree on flagpole repair not being the highest priority ?
2	3I	actually could almost go over here too .
1	6B	in the city you have those some places at the airport it would go under -
1	3I	household supplies or -
1	3I	uh , how bout soy beans , then cans of peas ? that work ?
1	3I	uh - i think i 'll go with the siding thing here . this is -
1	3I	maybe start a clothing -
1	6B	yeah , make sure .
0	6B	okay , so yeah . so we have nine .
2	6B	okay , so let 's - let 's go down and discuss it first and kind of see , like - for instance , math tutors i would certainly keep . yeah .
2	3I	picnic stuff there .
1	6B	let 's see , we , uh - let 's see -
2	6B	i think invasive species is more important to get rid of than the -
1	3I	so , i do n't know . yeah .
1	3I	and this - seems like it 's partly recreation an-
0	6B	what do you think , starting on the first one , what do you think assistant cook involves ?
2	3I	this store does n't sell bread ? kinda store is this ?
2	6B	and keep all the informational things , so we 're only doing two , right ?
1	3I	i would say canned peas would be going over here some place .
1	6B	okay . that 'll be on our list then . this one 's tough . this one 's a little more tough .
2	6B	probably not because i know that needle exchange also includes uh diabetes equipment for homeless and so on and so forth .
1	3I	can go with -
2	6B	need to be there .
1	3I	put stoves above that .
0	6B	like c_span would be something -
2	6B	that 's - that 's what i would think , right .
1	6B	so , get rid of the veterinary hospital ?
2	6B	it 's in my book , we trunc
2	6B	have them be adopted . there we go .
1	6B	i really like it . and it 's a good idea . um . let 's see what else we have uh before we do that .
2	6B	s_t_d_ trunc well , it 's - there 's like all these like branches of sexual education . just like - s_ -
1	3I	i would put it , like , over here .
1	3I	i 'll put face cream up here with the toothpaste .
1	6B	moon of yeah .
1	6B	yeah trunc trunc home ec .
1	3I	with clothes ?
2	6B	yeah , we could cut hospital additions instead of the sex offender database . okay !
1	3I	yeah , me too .
0	6B	to get rid of ?
2	6B	food bank we 're keeping .
0	3I	trunc okay , we do n't have , um -
1	3I	i think next to sugar .
2	6B	amber alert things ? is that news ? or - ? or - ?
2	6B	no , those are essential for homeless .
2	6B	so - but , if you cut it - i mean , if it was something you could cut -
1	6B	yeah . so , our task was to simply decide , which we have done . and they get to -
1	6B	important , i think .
0	6B	i 'm over on the right .
0	6B	so as the -
2	6B	and took that one out because by the time you 're an adult -
2	6B	sorta frivolous but then so does tattoo artist trunc but no it 's not -
0	6B	lady and the tramp ?
1	6B	well , i mean -
2	6B	food banks are important to keep .
1	3I	do you have a order preference ?
1	3I	right by siding . cases of whiskey .
2	6B	those are n't necessarily weeds , huh ?
2	6B	sit at home in a oatmeal bath .
2	6B	that one 's getting cut .
1	3I	ah ! okay . thick sweaters , yes . hm , face cream . that 's an oddball one . maybe here ? yeah .
1	3I	so you can turn around -
1	6B	bookkeeping is useful , and music teachers are useful .
2	6B	so what would you propose if the towing service people said -
1	3I	near the -
1	3I	i would say here in this - in this aisle .
1	6B	i think you have to have some at least .
2	3I	let 's grab another one .
1	6B	and the v_a_ .
1	6B	because that would also expand their reach .
1	6B	trunc yeah , yeah .
1	3I	trunc yeah . yeah .
3	6B	and that has a disastrous effect - on teenagers . disastrous .
0	6B	what was the - ?
1	3I	yeah , with the boating stuff , or -
2	6B	yeah , then you get adopted , yeah . keep that one .
2	3I	no , this is in fishing supplies .
2	3I	sure . i trunc they 'd go with soybeans , right ? i mean - although , in trunc reality , beets would be in with the - with the produce .
2	3I	we could put them down here .
2	6B	custodians . speech therapy . no . no no .
2	6B	um , and they built it . they like , cut down all our favorite trees . it was awful . it was so traumatic . yeah . and um , i remember like , in like second grade or something , and we 're all talking about , we 're gon na tie ourselves to the tree , and stuff .
1	6B	poetry books and -
1	6B	i do n't think you - i do n't think the public -
1	3I	yeah , or travel trunc yeah , between toys and travel guides ?
1	6B	i think the public access station . i think you 're right about that .
1	3I	i think since we got a lotta clothes - we may need to put the clothes - in between the toys and the pet food .
0	3I	we have like the small saws and stuff there .
1	6B	kitten and puppy adoption , i just think -
1	6B	tattoo artist licenses . i think that 's - pretty important . but it - oh .
1	3I	next to this ?
1	6B	one more .
2	3I	oh , toilet paper .
2	3I	can go with clothing stuff . so i 'm going to put trunc with the hats at the top of the -
1	3I	yeah . next to eggs ?
2	6B	so , the thing about speech therapy is , we would either - we would either need them - if we cut that , we 'd need the to do that on their own , which is kinda trunc of -
0	6B	okay . um , public services .
1	3I	i - i guess so , it seems kind of outdoorsy , does n't it ? i mean - um -
0	3I	thick sweaters .
0	3I	thick sweaters .
0	3I	thick sweaters .
0	3I	thick sweaters .
0	3I	thick sweaters ?
0	3I	thick sweaters .
1	6B	can go .
2	6B	i think the public news station would be - we - we should probably keep one of these .
2	6B	i 'd take out the juice machines .
2	6B	well , i do n't care about tattoos . but i know people do .
0	6B	did we do six from trunc from all these then ? let 's - let 's just take this one real quick .
1	6B	we could go through - well , we should say all the words i guess , so we should go one by one or i was thinking we could knock out the ones that seem inessential right off the bat .
1	6B	alright . here we go . which category do you wan na start at ?
2	3I	fishing net . this is all fishing stuff . half-inch tubing , of course . that 's - that has something to do with fishing .
2	3I	different areas . i think about -
1	3I	and that 's water .
1	6B	actually -
2	3I	we do n't really have a gardening section so i 'm just gon na put it with the paper bags and mouse traps . as things you find in the garage .
1	3I	large cups . so that 'd be , like , paper .
0	6B	i do n't even know what assistant cooks means in education and programs .
2	6B	not through the city .
1	6B	probably does n't require a class .
1	3I	here maybe ?
2	6B	i think that 's a county public health issue .
2	6B	or the public transportation pool is stuck , they would have to have something big enough as a bus .
0	3I	we start with cans of peas .
0	3I	trunc we have n't .
1	6B	dog catcher was gone .
1	3I	books ? travel guides .
1	3I	that should be , like , right here , next to the box knives ?
0	6B	that 's a federal , is n't it ?
2	3I	well , no , plastic jugs .
2	3I	or , could it go with the mousetraps .
0	6B	hmm . right .
0	3I	peat moss .
0	3I	peat moss .
0	3I	peat moss .
2	6B	i did n't take it with me . i - i learned cooking because - when i had to when i lived on my own for the first time .
1	6B	yep . i think that the dog catcher has to happen .
0	6B	where else - ? what did i see ?
1	6B	play , uh -
2	6B	now think about that for a second .
2	3I	just - we can just put it here .
1	6B	out of that list , i would go with the trunc in - cut out the invasive species removal .
0	3I	shoelaces , socks , clothes -
2	6B	the special ed teachers would be important , yeah .
1	3I	well that would be frozen , right ?
0	6B	um tsk taxi stops .
0	6B	um , what 's a public access station ? i do n't even know what that trunc no , i do n't know what that is .
1	6B	then we went ahead and did it anyway .
1	6B	the hunting tags , and the tattoo licenses .
1	3I	, trunc there or there .
0	6B	basketball -
2	6B	whether it 's online or paper , it would still be -
0	6B	now invasive trunc is this - species trunc is that like um -
1	3I	very good . awesome .
1	3I	yeah . light jackets .
1	3I	yeah . is that good ?
1	6B	a taxi stops is probably the one we 're gon na get rid of . yeah .
1	6B	let 's come back to that one . we 've got - we 've got - how many have we got ? we got two so far ?
1	3I	here . yeah .
2	6B	now why is a veterinary hospital a public service ?
1	3I	mousetraps , box knives , buckets , yeah .
2	6B	well the question is -
2	6B	i mean if we cut pest control that could be really bad for everybody . and you 're right , i - i mean the boy 's basketball club , the junior soccer league , those things are very important for kids .
1	6B	serve their needs .
2	6B	i would too . you know , i could argue that if it 's in a play area with children , you do n't want toxic weed killers all over the grass anyway , if they 're playing on the grass .
2	6B	yeah , yeah . sure , sure sure sure .
1	6B	done well .
1	6B	yeah so you would cut towing service-
1	6B	that 's good for business and stuff i guess .
1	3I	yeah . okay let 's see -
2	3I	unless these are meant for the kitchen .
3	6B	well , but trunc that - some - mean , some of these things , you know , they do - for me , they do punch a button .
0	3I	more like -
2	6B	i think it is . i think we should put that on our -
0	3I	i have -
2	3I	think this is good . and bagels would be -
1	6B	what would you get rid of ?
2	6B	i think we 've got a plan .
1	3I	yeah , could still just go in this section .
0	6B	uh , public access station .
2	6B	invasive species removal . well , i happen to believe in that , but i 'd trunc happy to revisit it .
1	3I	household -
1	3I	household .
1	3I	household .
2	6B	use - you -
1	6B	so they want us to say the words probably , so trunc i 'll read it . um -
1	3I	yeah , that 's true . for all this stuff , too .
0	3I	tweezers , um -
1	3I	it 's -
0	3I	trunc what kinda boots ?
1	3I	i hink we 're breaking the rules . i think we 're not supposed to move things around .
1	3I	and then i will put -
0	3I	there are oatmeals and pouches .
0	6B	boys basketball -
2	3I	um , then it - they have to go by the refrigerated items
1	6B	sex ed seems pretty important to me custodians are pretty important .
1	6B	and taxi stops .
1	6B	and taxi stops .
0	6B	got spaying
2	6B	cuz i ca n't remember if we had county money or not . we must have had county money , cuz we had five - we had five funding sources . part of it was trunc bonds -
2	6B	like there 's plenty in eastern washington .
1	6B	but we 're down to just trunc one item .
2	6B	probably kind of important . especially if we 're gon na - additional bus stops .
0	6B	let 's see bookkeeping . music .
1	3I	yep , that makes sense . okay . yep . kay .
1	6B	let 's do a happy -
2	6B	so we 'll keep the subway system for now .
1	3I	yeah , probably close to the food but -
1	3I	sticks of butter . next to eggs ?
1	6B	invasive - okay , invasive species removal , that 's - that seems like it might be a good program to have .
1	3I	yeah , that 's good . yeah .
2	3I	it could be -
1	6B	like tattoo artist license .
2	6B	uh , bookkeeping classes , no . music teachers -
1	6B	i feel like it 's - could be kind of important .
2	6B	yeah . soup kitchens might get picked up by somebody else . housing assistance has to happen .
