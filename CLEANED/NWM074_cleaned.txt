1	3I	yeah , i think that 's good .
1	3I	yeah yeah .
1	3I	absolutely .

1	3I	we do n't know what kind of flags we 're talking about , do we ?
1	3I	consider it done .
0	3I	empty plastic jugs .
0	3I	um -
0	3I	i - i - eh .

0	3I	packages of cookies , boxes of donuts .
1	3I	right ?
1	3I	you bet .
1	3I	yeah , i think it 's householdy stuff .
1	3I	uh , i 'd call that - that 's somehow a hardware-ish - well , unless it 's - yeah , it 's a hardware-ish thing .
1	3I	i suppose it c-
2	3I	yep , i trunc i was - yeah , i completely agree .
0	3I	uh , right there .
0	3I	fishing net .
2	3I	i 'm not even gon na consult with you .
0	3I	um , chocolate bars .
1	3I	where 's our - uh - here , maybe ?
1	3I	sweets , which we sort of - but that 's okay .
0	3I	uh , box knives .
1	3I	agreed ?
1	3I	absolutely .
1	3I	sure .
2	3I	oh , we 're bussing right though this sucker .
0	3I	gas powered cook stoves .
2	3I	what 's weird about this is - is there were - they do n't - they do n't care about our organization . they - they only care about how we 're pronouncing these various things . sticks of butter .
1	3I	technic-
0	3I	is that over here ?
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	and large cups . we had something like large cups . did n't we have , uh - ?
1	6B	i agree .
0	6B	i 'm basically just looking at the first column right now .
1	6B	pretty much -
1	6B	pretty much -
1	6B	they 've sort of rationalized the groups .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	um sure .
1	6B	um , i agree with you on math tutors .
1	6B	um , i think if you 're gon na have a kitchen -
1	6B	of any sort , or for that matter a food warm up program in the school - in schools or whatever you 're gon na continue to need assistant cooks .
3	6B	i personally believe that sort of health ed , sex ed matters .
3	6B	custodians , same story .
2	6B	speech therapy -
2	6B	i think think probably schools need that .
3	6B	football equipment , you 're getting into my political turf there . i love football , and i hate football .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	right . okay well that 'll trunc yeah .
2	6B	well , i mean - i just - i - i think - i 'm - i do love to watch football . i played it myself in high school .
2	6B	i , um - but i - but i think it is a public health -
2	6B	terrible threat . i mean i and this - and this even before the newest evidence has come out about -
2	6B	um , repetitive impact brain injuries .
3	6B	i just think football does n't belong in our schools .
0	6B	acting coaches .
2	6B	that 's - that would be my preference . um , just if i 'm looking for -
0	6B	um -
0	6B	yep .
2	6B	although i 'm - i mean i - almost any youngster i know -
2	6B	unless they had kinda a stage mamma -
2	6B	who had introduction to , like -
2	6B	theater and drama got it through their schools . they did n't get it -
1	6B	well , i do n't know what an acting coach -
1	6B	yeah , that 's what -
2	6B	i see what you mean . okay , let 's drop acting coaches . they 'll - they 'll - if a kid wants it they 'll figure it out somehow
0	6B	um -
1	6B	i think they should stay , for the moment .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	a interesting thing . yes , i trunc i agree .
1	6B	uh , cooking classes - home ec , i actually -
2	6B	am a big subscriber to home ec , and i think it should be co-ed .
2	6B	uh , notetakers just falls in to the same category to me as special ed teachers .
1	6B	sugar free juice machines . well , there 's reality and there 's the game we 're playing .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	i happen to believe that we should n't be f-
2	6B	promoting crap food for the kids .
2	6B	those machines , none the less , are actually profit makers -
2	6B	for the school .
2	6B	i think .
1	6B	well , if you - if you took - if you -
1	6B	i do n't think you - i do n't think the public -
1	6B	the county pays to put the sugar free juice machines in . i think the juice companies -
1	6B	pay
1	6B	to put -
1	6B	um , so it 's actually a small profit center for the public sector to have those juice machines in there .
1	6B	i do n't think so . i do n't think so . and then , what the hell is sugar free juice ? i 'd trunc i mean frankly i mean soda pop is one thing -
1	6B	sugar free , to me , is almost as evil as -
1	6B	a soda trunc i mean -
2	6B	exactly . exactly .
1	6B	uh , bookkeeping classes . um , trunc i mean - i 'd say that the only two things that -
2	6B	i could get rid of the sugar free juice machines , if it 's truly sugar free .
2	6B	i can get rid of the football equipment and the sugar free , at least on the first cut .
1	6B	oh , and acting coaches . we got - we got rid of three things .
0	6B	bookkeeping classes .
1	6B	uh , i think it 's a decent set of skills . and music - uh , music to me is -
2	6B	it 's essential . yeah , yeah .
0	6B	so what - what have we gotten rid there ? we 've gotten rid of , uh , football -
0	6B	acting coaches -
0	6B	trunc sugar fee juice machines - is that it so far ?
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	move to next column ?
1	6B	yeah this -
1	6B	i do too . i mean
2	6B	vaccinations , absolutely .
2	6B	invasive species removal . well , i happen to believe in that , but i 'd trunc happy to revisit it .
1	6B	i do - i do it . i do it on a volunteer basis myself .
2	6B	but it does require some public money to coordinate it .
1	6B	uh , cuz i do it on park and - i mean i do it and county .
1	6B	um , properties .
0	6B	um -
0	6B	i work with -
0	6B	green seattle , i think it 's called .
0	6B	i do n't know . i just sign up , and go out there and - i work on the same trunc we 've been doing the burke gilman trail . yeah , it 's , uh -
1	6B	no , i 'm just sorta reading through the list here . s_t_d_s - trunc i -
1	6B	probably part of the same as , um -
1	6B	reproductive education .
2	6B	toxic waste disposal , ca n't get rid of that .
1	6B	hospital additions , interesting . bagel factory inspectors -
0	6B	um -
1	6B	i 'm -
1	6B	uh - i trunc i - yeah , i mean i - but - by the way , i 'm just sort of going through the list right now , and - uh - i do n't disagree with you .
1	6B	needle exchange , i think is a basic public health issue .
0	6B	sex offender data , veteran 's medical assistance -
1	6B	i thought that was federal .
1	6B	yeah , we 're a county committee .
1	6B	egg farm regulations , i thought that was state and or federal .
1	6B	prenatal check-ups , neighborhood watch support - okay i ready to - i 'm ready to hit some stuff here .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	i 'm trunc i 'm ready to immediately hit -
2	6B	sounds ruthless , but veteran 's medical assistance , cuz i do n't think it should be in our budget .
2	6B	egg farm regulations , to the best of my knowledge is either a sate department of agriculture , or an f_d_a responsibility .
1	6B	yeah . so let trunc so trunc so minimally one could fold one into the other and cut some budget .
0	6B	um -
0	6B	yep .
0	6B	oh !
1	6B	good .
1	6B	excellent work .
0	6B	um - oh , and the hospital additions !
0	6B	recreation and public service .
0	6B	there was in one of our other exercises , there was a reference to public news station . i was n't -
0	6B	quite sure - or - no , it was public access - public access something .
0	6B	but i presume public news station is - do you live in seattle proper ?
0	6B	you know , then on your - do you have cable t_v_ ?
2	6B	oh . there are three or four really interesting -
1	6B	of the -
0	6B	well there 's - there 's the seattle channel . there 's the king county channel . there 's the -
0	6B	state of washington channel .
0	6B	there 's actually three different c_spans , if you have cable .
0	6B	one , two and three .
0	6B	and there 's a public access channel .
2	6B	all of which are moderately interesting . i mean the seattle channel is actually brilliant .
1	6B	i mean it 's - there 's actually programming to be seen on that .
0	6B	um -
0	6B	so , i do n't know what the public news station is . i do n't know whether that 's like a k_u_o_w_ kinda thing or -
0	6B	what .
1	6B	junior soccer league , i can go right there immediately . uh , we got ta maintain it . we obviously got ta maintain our fields , but i thought the leagues -
1	6B	were -
1	6B	non-profit self supporting kinds of things .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	kitten puppy adoption , to me is -
1	6B	part of stray cat - oh , stray cat spaying .
1	6B	that 's - stray cat spaying is something different -
2	6B	yeah , but stray cat spaying is , like , feral - is i think , like feral cats .
0	6B	um , soup kitchens , housing assistance , dog catcher -
0	6B	boy basketball club , trunc
0	6B	oh , there is public access station versus public news station .
2	6B	i trunc no , i trunc i think i know what it - i mean i think i 'm right . i think public news station is something like those stations i just was laying out .
2	6B	public access is still another category . all the cable companies obligated to make a channel available .
2	6B	but i th-
1	6B	precisely .
1	6B	yep . yeah .
2	6B	i thought that - i thought that the cable companies were actually obligated to underwrite that or to pay for that .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	i would do the -
1	6B	a public access station . i would do the junior soccer league .
1	6B	trunc for taking out .
1	6B	junior trunc oh , and the boys basketball club -
1	6B	which gets a little complicated because i think -
1	6B	that kind - i mean , this and this i think are usually non-profit community organizations , the junior soccer league and the boys basketball club .
1	6B	but they do use public facilities .
1	6B	but if we keep -
1	6B	public facilities we 'll se what we get when we get over here .
1	6B	but if we keep them up , they can still use the public facilities .
1	6B	but we do n't have to pay to organize the leagues .
1	6B	oh , well there 'd be a human crying out .
0	6B	hm .
2	6B	the reusable - trunc well , a_ the voters did not reject it -
2	6B	b_
2	6B	well in seattle we all more or less doing it .
1	6B	or i mean king county , i guess .
1	6B	it 's very hard to get a plastic bag anymore as a matter of fact now if you -
1	6B	i save them when i 'm in a trunc when i 'm in a jurisdiction that does n't have -
1	6B	the bag thing , i 'll ask to have it double bagged so i 'll have -
1	6B	you know it 's -
1	6B	i trunc i try and be green , but -
1	6B	i think we 're in the ballpark here . i think , um -
1	6B	i think we 've done j-
1	6B	junior soccer league - i think we 've done basketball club and i think -
1	6B	public access station .
1	6B	and we could , although we have three everywhere else - i think -
1	6B	the reusable bag campaign . and again remember we do n't have to actually have to do this . they just want to hear us talking .
2	6B	trunc i could see getting rid of the reusable bag campaign . although - although , as a public service campaign -
1	6B	it 's , uh -
0	6B	you know .
1	6B	and in my travels i 've - i have definitely seen how evil -
1	6B	plastic bags can get .
1	6B	should we move over to the next category , infrastructure and licensing ?
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing .
1	6B	the state - this county does not do teaching certificates .
1	6B	well , i know - i know i 'm right . that 's my - that 's part of my career .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	on county roads they do em , so -
0	6B	um -
1	6B	bus stops , that is a transportation function of -
1	6B	the county government , or -
1	6B	um - boating licensing is state , not county to the best of my knowledge , although there might be some sort of fee generation that i 'm unaware of . i do n't own a boat .
2	6B	i think that 's a county public health issue .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	yeah , but i think that 's a state - i think boating licenses are state , not county . i 'm a-
2	6B	trunc my only question on boating licenses is whether there 's any revenue source for the counties out of - like , when you - when you -
2	6B	trunc put a new tab on your car .
1	6B	i do n't know .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	it 's a big ti-
1	6B	hunting tags is state .
2	6B	i know that .
0	6B	subway system .
0	6B	uh .
1	6B	i do n't - i do n't know .
1	6B	yeah , and i 'm - i 'm -
1	6B	and that - at this point -
1	6B	is probably multi-jurisdictional .
1	6B	the feds would always be in it and so forth .
2	6B	uh , towing services - you need to have that contract .
2	6B	i think if you 're on - if you 're on a county road and you have a -
2	6B	abandoned car -
2	6B	someone has to have a way of -
2	6B	having a non-corrupt way of having that car removed .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	you know - i trunc i do n't - trunc the issue is n't getting my car towed . the issue is keeping the trunc keeping people from , like , abandoning their cars on public roadways .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	massage certificates is probably a - might - massage - if they mean massage licensing -
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	what 's the county doing in that ?
0	6B	um -
0	6B	flagpole repair .
1	6B	whew .
1	6B	yeah right .
0	6B	um -
0	6B	flagpole repair .
1	6B	i do n't know what to make of it .
1	6B	it 's a frill . that 's right . if you wan na repair your flagpole
0	6B	um tsk taxi stops .
2	6B	i think of taxi stops as being more urban than county .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	i mean where would you - ? where would the county put a taxi stop ?
1	6B	out at the airport ?
1	6B	yes .
1	6B	see i 'm thinking most -
1	6B	in the city you have those some places at the airport it would go under -
1	6B	or for that matter , it would be port of seattle .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	and in - in more suburban settings that are maybe unincorporated king county , for example if it was at a hotel , the probably have place right on the hotel grounds .
#	6B	fort taxis to line up . they have that -
1	6B	yeah , and they - and they probably , at least indirectly , pay through trunc pay for it through their licensing fees .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	i - i think that could go .
1	6B	uh , public bus upkeep , yes . fishing licenses is state of washington .
1	6B	drainage ditches is sure . i have no - so -
0	6B	um -
2	6B	that 's state of washington .
2	6B	subway system we do n't get . whoops !
1	6B	thank you .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	hunting tags is state of washington .
2	6B	fishing licenses is state of washington .
2	6B	and we 've said every word on these lists . i think we should call valerie in .
2	6B	cuz we do n't actually have to resolve these issues .
0	6B	we 've said the trunc valerie , we 've said the words .
2	6B	right .
2	6B	or even trunc flagpole repair which - which - which nancy thinks is a frill .
