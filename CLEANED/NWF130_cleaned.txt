0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	they could 've - they could 've gone -
0	3I	hm !
0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	well , i 'm pretty satisfied with how it looks .
1	3I	okay , i think we got it .
1	6B	well , i - i would just think that we could just start in the first column trunc look to see what we think are important .
1	6B	important things .
1	6B	yeah , or we could just look and - and um like she said , you know , if there 's some things that seem -
1	6B	kinda ridiculous or -
0	6B	that seem really extraneous .
1	6B	for instance -
0	6B	um -
1	6B	in education and programs , if you have to cut -
1	6B	acting coaches -
1	6B	mm . to me that seems like -
1	6B	that something extra -
1	6B	that trunc you would do if you had a big budget .
1	6B	then sure , you could have acting coaches .
0	6B	um -
0	6B	oh yeah .
2	6B	that 's important . yeah , that 's very important . assistant cooks -
2	6B	yeah , that i think is extraneous .
1	6B	right .
1	6B	sex ed , i think -
1	6B	yeah . i think that would be important . custodians , you -
0	6B	maybe -
2	6B	that - that might be kinda iffy . you wan na keep things up , and it 's important to keep things in good condition .
1	6B	speech therapy -
1	6B	would - i mean that would be important . to have that .
1	6B	if you could possibly swing it .
1	6B	football equipment , maybe -
1	6B	something like that that 's kind of extraneous , and you could hopefully get somebody to donate or whatever .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	poetry books -
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	the special ed teachers would be important , yeah .
2	6B	cuz that would be extraneous .
0	6B	note takers for disability services .
2	6B	yeah , something like that in a paid position . maybe that would be better to try to get a volunteer , kind of .
2	6B	situation .
1	6B	right right . well , for right now we could leave it on there and just see .
2	6B	sugar free juice machines , no .
2	6B	uh , bookkeeping classes , no . music teachers -
2	6B	that 's a more important -
0	6B	so , we 're going to nix the assistant cooks -
0	6B	the -
0	6B	uh , custodians , the football equipment , the acting coaches , the poetry books , the cooking classes -
0	6B	note takers , maybe we 'll leave that in for right now . uh , sugar free juice machines , bookkeeping classes , and music teachers . so we 've got nine things we 're cutting .
0	6B	so , that 's - yeah . we 'll trunc yeah .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	job training , that would be important .
2	6B	chicken pox vaccinations of course . invasive trunc invasive species removal .
2	6B	that might be borderline .
2	6B	s_t_d_ education 's pretty important . toxic waste is important . hospital additions . tsk .
2	6B	hmm . well would trunc depend - depend on a lot of things .
2	6B	yeah , depend on the need in the - in the community .
2	6B	i - we might have to - we might have to put off hospital additions .
2	6B	bagel factory inspections , you probably want to put that off .
2	6B	that 's kinda borderline .
2	6B	sex offender database . that 's , i think , pretty important .
1	6B	veteran 's medical assistance . yeah . egg farm regulations .
0	6B	yeah , public health and safety .
0	6B	weed control .
0	6B	mm-hmm .
1	6B	right . right , more the health -
2	6B	yeah , prenatal check-ups , important . neighborhood watch support , that might have to i do n't know . what do you think ? that - that would be pretty -
0	6B	mm-hmm .
0	6B	so so far we 've said , um , the invasive - invasive species removal would go -
0	6B	um hospital additions , bagel factory inspections , needle exchange , that 's four .
0	6B	um , egg farm , five , weed control , six -
0	6B	so we 've done six . we had nine in the first one , six now in this one . okay , well we 'll -
1	6B	we can go back .
0	6B	recreation and public services .
1	6B	st spaying um no .
0	6B	public news station .
1	6B	that 's probably eeh .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	junior soccer league .
2	6B	have to maybe try to find volunteers to do that . kitten and puppy adoption . probably that would n't be . yeah . soup kitchens , yes .
1	6B	yes .
2	6B	um , boy 's basketball club that - you know , those are things that .
1	6B	yeah , i mean they 're great to have , but if you 're on a budget cut thing you probably would have to .
0	6B	yeah . so the public access station , i wonder what the difference is between that and the news station . is that like more for trunc emergency stuff ?
0	6B	mm-hmm .
0	6B	mm-hmm .
1	6B	so the access station , but not the news station , that stay . reusable bag campaign , probably not as important . veterinary hospital .
0	6B	mm .
2	6B	yeah , probably not .
2	6B	no pest control , you probably want to keep that . so we 've - we 've cut nine from here , and nine from here , but only six from here .
2	6B	yeah , you have to have that . and you have to have speed limit signs . additional bus stops probably would have to let that go .
1	6B	yeah . boating licenses .
1	6B	i guess , i do n't know what - what that entails . you have to have , it 's public safety .
0	6B	oh , now it 's back .
2	6B	okay , so we 'll uh say forget about the bus stops , forget about the tattoo boating we might save , pothole maintenance that 's probably important want to wreck our cars .
2	6B	subway system , we need our public transportation . hunting tags , that could probably -
1	6B	yeah , towing services .
2	6B	nah that would n't be a public service .
2	6B	no .
2	6B	no .
0	6B	taxi stops .
2	6B	mm . yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	public bus upkeep , you need that . drainage ditches , you need that .
0	6B	okay , so i think we 've got eight off of here so let 's - let 's review that again , so we 're trunc we want teaching certificates . we want speed limit .
0	6B	we do n't need the bus stops . we do n't need the tattoo artists . we do n't need the boating . we do n't need -
0	6B	hunting , towing or massage .
0	6B	or flagpole repair , or taxi stops , or fishing licenses .
0	6B	okay , so yeah . so we have nine .
1	6B	either we - well either we - either we need to -
1	6B	cut more or add trunc add something back to the other three , and that might be easier than cutting .
1	6B	more from here , because i think we were pretty brutal .
1	6B	with the public health and safety .
1	6B	so -
1	6B	music teachers .
0	6B	uh , let 's see . what could we add back ? okay .
1	6B	uh , we could trunc well -
1	6B	okay , so assistant cooks we 've got off . custodians ! maybe add back custodians to - for upkeep .
0	6B	yes , we did . i think we kept that .
0	6B	so we could still get rid of assistant cooks , get rid of uh , football equipment , get rid of acting coaches , poetry books .
0	6B	uh , cooking classes then sugar free juice machines -
1	6B	and bookkeeping . yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	so - so , we could add back - let 's see we - so we had nine things that we cut , so we could add back three .
1	6B	add back custodians , add back -
0	6B	uh -
1	6B	acting coaches ? and add back music teachers ?
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	yeah , that sounds good . so that leaves us still cutting assistant cooks -
0	6B	um -
0	6B	football equipment -
0	6B	poetry books .
0	6B	cooking classes .
0	6B	sugar free juice machines .
0	6B	and bookkeeping . so there are six things now that we have got off of there .
0	6B	and we already had gotten six things from each there .
0	6B	did we do - ?
0	6B	did we do six from trunc from all these then ? let 's - let 's just take this one real quick .
0	6B	stray cat spaying we 've already public news junior soccer , kitten and puppy adoption -
0	6B	uh , dog catcher -
0	6B	boys basketball -
0	6B	reusable bag campaign - that 's already seven .
0	6B	veterinary hospital is eight . we did nine , i think , from those other ones . so we could add -
0	6B	we could add back three things .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	i think we kept that one . yeah . we did keep that one cuz we said we thought that was important .
0	6B	um -
0	6B	let 's see .
1	6B	well , maybe the dog catcher ? add that back ? so you do n't have stray dogs running around ?
1	6B	yeah , i guess we would have to - we would have to add both - back both junior soccer and basketball if we were gon na add one we would probably have to add back the other because then somebody would be -
1	6B	unhappy .
1	6B	yeah , we could add - we could add back the dog catcher , basketball and the soccer .
0	6B	okay .
0	6B	alrighty .
1	6B	right . right . uh-huh .
1	6B	and keeping - keeping kids occupied and off the streets , and keeping crime down .
0	6B	and so this one i think we also must have had . um -
0	6B	nine , let 's see we 're - we were gon na get rid of the bus stops -
0	6B	the tattoo , the boating -
0	6B	the hunting , the towing -
0	6B	the massage , the flag pole , the taxi stops the fishing licenses . so that was nine , so we can add back three things .
0	6B	um -
0	6B	to that and -
0	6B	um -
1	6B	yeah , you want that kinda monitored . i agree . i agree with that .
1	6B	um , so add back the hunting tags , and maybe add back -
1	6B	the additional bus stops ? because , you know , for disadvantaged people that 's how they get around and -
1	6B	not that they - not that they could n't walk a little further .
1	6B	mm . well , that 's true .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	disabled people , though , that need to ride busses . i do n't know if that -
1	6B	right .
1	6B	okay , so what else could we add back ? we added back the hunting tags .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah , that would - that would make sense . if we 're gon na trunc do hunting , to do the fishing .
0	6B	yeah . yeah .
0	6B	mm-hmm .
1	6B	right . right . yeah , that 's a safety kind of issue as well .
0	6B	so on that one if we were gon na try to cut it to just six things we 'd have the additional bus stops , the tattoo -
0	6B	um -
0	6B	the towing , massage -
0	6B	flag pole repair , taxi stops .
0	6B	kay ? does that sound reasonable ?
0	6B	alright . i think we 've solved all the problems for the -
0	6B	reducing -
0	6B	budget .
0	6B	right .
