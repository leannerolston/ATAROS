1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	okay , and we have loose leaf paper . hm .
1	3I	toilet paper but it 's - it 's kind of a different -

1	3I	like a toiletry product , and then like a household product .
0	3I	okay .
0	3I	so let 's see here .
1	3I	should we put it on this side ?

1	3I	it 's an odd item .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	okay , so would we say that would be more a trunc trunc a , like food -
1	3I	type of category , or put it - ?
1	3I	in two okay .

1	3I	would you rather put this one down by -
1	3I	like , the dried foods , or maybe - since it 's a bread , maybe by cake mix ?
1	3I	maybe lean towards , like , the middle of the aisle . okay .
1	3I	trunc do that .
0	3I	hats !
2	3I	oh , wow .
1	3I	looks like we needs a - an apparel section .

1	3I	maybe here ? okay .
0	3I	chocolate bars .
0	3I	hm -
1	3I	could either i would think either go down here by some of the dry foods , or , like , up -
1	3I	trunc trunc i 'm thinking the -
1	3I	quaker oatmeal pouches , like -
1	3I	which i 'd put more up towards like a sweet -
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	seems good . okay . half inch tubing .
1	3I	this looks like , uh , aisle one .
1	3I	let 's see , maybe by the bundles of sticks ?
0	3I	light jackets .
1	3I	yeah . yeah .
1	3I	makes sense .
0	3I	beets .
1	3I	okay , maybe above soybeans ?
1	3I	should we put them next to our - ?
2	3I	ah , that 's the trick .
1	3I	uh , maybe , let 's say fresh since they do n't say . so -
1	3I	yeah , maybe here ? okay .
0	3I	oh -
0	3I	okay , let 's see .
1	3I	miscellaneous item -
2	3I	wow .
2	3I	the two places i 'm seeing that would make the most sense in my head would be down here . or by these -
2	3I	items .
1	3I	okay .
0	3I	okay , scissors -
1	3I	yeah . okay let 's see -
1	3I	what do you think ?
1	3I	down ? kay .
0	3I	okay .
0	3I	okay .
1	3I	now we have choices . so -
1	3I	i could - we could put it by our scissors .
1	3I	that would probably make the trunc make sense .
0	3I	okay , cans of peas .
1	3I	canned food .
1	3I	i guess they are n't -
1	3I	down here ?
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	let 's do that .
0	3I	water .
1	3I	lots of options on this one .
1	3I	what are you thinking ?
1	3I	possibly , like in this area ?
1	3I	course then we have all , like , our -
1	3I	food and -
1	3I	we 'll have different types of , like trunc i 'm assuming we 'll have the juice and -
1	3I	so this 'll probably go together .
2	3I	this is turning into an awesome store .
2	3I	actually could almost go over here too .
1	3I	how bout right above empty plastic jugs ?
0	3I	okay .
0	3I	buckets .
0	3I	oh , buckets , okay .
1	3I	well we 've got -
1	3I	we 've got some , like -
0	3I	let 's see here .
1	3I	so it could go , maybe in this area , or by the boating supplies and fishing net ?
1	3I	could use buckets for that . yeah ? maybe there ?
0	3I	okay .
0	3I	tweezers .
1	3I	hm . oh , did n't we have - ? yeah by like the face cream .
0	3I	okay cookies .
0	3I	oh , this -
1	3I	here ?
1	3I	alright .
1	3I	that was an easy one .
0	3I	oo .
1	3I	yeah . yeah , that 's a good call . yeah .
0	3I	okay , bars of soap .
0	3I	okay .
2	3I	yeah , there we go .
1	3I	ah , either or .
1	3I	nice . okay , tow ropes .
2	3I	it 's got ta go over here .
1	3I	um let 's see . i guess there .
0	3I	okay .
1	3I	ah , it has to go over there again i - i would think .
1	3I	i do n't know . maybe , maybe by like , some of these items . like , we have our -
1	3I	like trunc work out items . okay , wetsuits .
2	3I	ah , some - boating . up here ?
1	3I	okay .
0	3I	where did the - ?
0	3I	other coats go ?
1	3I	oh , there they are . okay . yeah , i guess right around there . would you prefer here , or here ?
1	3I	up ? okay , let 's do that .
0	3I	oh .
1	3I	light jackets ? perfect . okay canvas bags -
0	3I	hm -
1	3I	let 's see , i guess -
1	3I	could do it up at the very top . okay .
0	3I	kay .
2	3I	oh no !
2	3I	this is a space , right ?
2	3I	well , i guess it could go , like under tow -
2	3I	ropes . or by the axes , or whatever .
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	socks .
1	3I	oh man , okay do we use it in our last little - ?
1	3I	space right here ?
1	3I	or would it be okay to put our socks down somewhere else ?
0	3I	do you think we 'll have shoes ?
0	3I	we have shoe laces .
1	3I	maybe down here ?
1	3I	yeah okay .
1	3I	okay .
0	3I	um .
0	3I	hm .
2	3I	certainly depends on what type of flag they are .
1	3I	like having that makes me think it has to do something with , like a wave down flag , or -
1	3I	not like a national flag , but who knows ?
1	3I	could be .
1	3I	i guess if that was the case -
1	3I	maybe somewhere down here .
1	3I	yeah , either or . it 's kind of an odd one okay .
0	3I	bottles of juice .
0	3I	oo .
1	3I	okay , what are you thinking ? cuz we have our liters of water you wan na put it there ?
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	yeah , i guess so .
1	3I	heavy cable . oo , tow ropes .
1	3I	well that worked out .
0	3I	hm .
1	3I	maybe - maybe at the bottom ? down there i guess ?
0	3I	interesting . okay . oh , box knives .
1	3I	what do you say ? here ? or - ?
2	3I	oh yeah ! we could do that . yeah .
1	3I	let 's do that .
1	3I	cutting objects .
0	3I	books !
0	3I	um -
0	3I	wow .
1	3I	maybe - maybe by toys .
1	3I	yeah .
2	3I	yeah , children 's books .
0	3I	books of matches .
1	3I	ah , maybe -
1	3I	maybe we could put it over trunc oh . what do you think ? would you prefer to put it by like the - these items - ?
1	3I	i could see this being trunc maybe something that you - ah , ah . i do n't know .
1	3I	i 'm thinkin maybe over here .
1	3I	yeah ? okay . how bout - how bout -
1	3I	there .
1	3I	yeah ? okay .
0	3I	oh .
1	3I	well , we have small axes .
1	3I	except we do n't have any more clothing items .

2	3I	oh no ! thick sweaters .
1	3I	shoot .
0	3I	well , okay -
1	3I	gah ! maybe by socks .
0	3I	alright .
0	3I	oo .
0	3I	i 've got fleece lined boots .
0	3I	well , let 's see . okay -
1	3I	well we got two spots there . maybe we could - yeah .
0	3I	okay .
0	3I	cushions .
1	3I	there maybe ?
2	3I	alright !
2	3I	that aisle is awesome .
2	3I	these ones are a little sad .
0	3I	were - are trunc were we missing items from our lists ? okay .
2	3I	either that or we just loaded up this one .
2	3I	that was fun .
1	6B	okay , should we just pick a number ?
0	6B	how does - ? uh -
1	6B	maybe we can cut half .
0	6B	one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fourteen - okay , i 've got seven region alright .
0	6B	education and programs .
0	6B	so we have -
0	6B	math tutors -
0	6B	um -
0	6B	tutors .
1	6B	maybe .
1	6B	i 'd say that one 's kinda on the fence .
0	6B	okay , assistant cooks .
1	6B	maybe . no . no . sex ed .
1	6B	that seems pretty important .
0	6B	um custodians .
2	6B	i would say that 's important too okay , so those two are keepers speech therapy -
1	6B	yeah . okay , so those three stay . um , football equipment .
2	6B	they can fundraise . so that can get the axe .
0	6B	um , acting coaches .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	that kinda , um seems like it would fall inta the same category as football equipment .
1	6B	yeah . okay , so poetry books ?
0	6B	uh -
1	6B	maybe .
1	6B	books are important .
0	6B	uh , special ed teachers .
2	6B	that 's a definitely .
0	6B	so we have sex ed , custodians , speech therapy -
0	6B	and special ed teachers .
1	6B	cooking classes ?
1	6B	uh i 'd axe it maybe .
0	6B	okay .
0	6B	um , sugar free - oh trunc note takers .
2	6B	yeah . yeah , it seems like a good service to have okay , so we have five there . um , sugar free juice machines .
1	6B	yeah , i do n't either .
0	6B	bookkeeping classes .
1	6B	maybe .
0	6B	if not five .
0	6B	yeah , i did n't either .
1	6B	so , axe it ?
0	6B	then we have music teachers .
1	6B	yeah , i think so too . so , there 's our six , and then we have -
0	6B	a few at the top that -
1	6B	we 're on the fence on . would you rather have assistant cooks , or math tutors ?
1	6B	okay . good call .
0	6B	okay so those are our seven .
0	6B	um , public health and safety .
0	6B	kay , reproductive education
1	6B	i do n't think so .
1	6B	think more of an education and programs .
1	6B	so , probably not for that one . um -
0	6B	job training programs .
0	6B	uh -
1	6B	possibly .
1	6B	like on the fence , maybe with that one ? okay .
0	6B	chicken pox vaccinations .
1	6B	that seems kind of important .
1	6B	i do n't know maybe .
1	6B	good point . good point .
1	6B	okay , so probably not with that one .
1	6B	invasive - okay , invasive species removal , that 's - that seems like it might be a good program to have .
1	6B	you think so too ?
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	actually -
1	6B	i guess it depends on what it is , like how harmful it is .
0	6B	i 'm going extreme in my head .
1	6B	like it 's gon na -
1	6B	mess with the population , but if it was something more like -
1	6B	like a certain species of bees -
1	6B	or something that 's not really going to effect lives , then -
1	6B	so possibly ?
0	6B	uh , s_t_d_ education .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	it 's a maybe again .
0	6B	um .
0	6B	are we doing that too ? or just - ?
0	6B	oh , yeah .
1	6B	yeah , right ?
1	6B	okay , toxic waste disposal . uh , yeah . that - that seems -
2	6B	like a - okay , so definitely that one . hospital additions ?
1	6B	i do n't think so .
1	6B	bagel factory inspections i do n't know about that one .
1	6B	right ? it 's probably only that one . uh , needle exchange .
2	6B	it 's seems like a good service , but it also seems kinda like , um -
2	6B	it 's very dependant on , like -
0	6B	the -
2	6B	it 's almost like a trunc i do n't want to call it a luxury , but - it 's kida like a luxury service to have like if you 've got all your bases covered , and you have extra money then you 'd have a needle exchange .
0	6B	veteran 's medical assistance .
1	6B	i think so too , take care of - take care of okay , so there 's four . egg farm regulations .
0	6B	uh -
1	6B	yeah , i do n't know about that one .
0	6B	weed control .
0	6B	ah .
1	6B	i guess trunc i do n't know how harmful , like , having weeds grow up on the side of the road could be , you know ? so - probably not ?
0	6B	prenatal check-ups
1	6B	trunc trunc i ' trunc maybe we should think that way cuz it seems like a luxury type of thing . but , like , yeah i guess -
1	6B	yeah , okay . and then neighborhood watch support .
0	6B	uh -
1	6B	i do n't know .
1	6B	uh , it seems like it -
1	6B	trunc it seems like , uh - a little extra too like , some of the like hospital additions and toxic waste trunc waste disposal seem pretty straight forward , but -
1	6B	okay , so we 'll keep -
0	6B	what did we say ? um , toxic waste , hospital -
1	6B	sex offender database , veteran 's medical assistance and then we have three more to keep .
1	6B	yeah , job training seems good , so that 's five .
0	6B	um -
0	6B	comes down to -
1	6B	which of these is better than the others ?
0	6B	public health and safety . well -
1	6B	i 'd say maybe -
1	6B	chicken pox trunc now that i think of it , seems a little bit like , uh , do n't need that one .
1	6B	so much , um - maybe reproductive education .
1	6B	then again , that could fall under the other category .
1	6B	maybe we should just pick two .
1	6B	i would say , like , between prenatal and reproductive , one of the two .
1	6B	if either .
1	6B	maybe prenatal check-ups .
0	6B	and then -
1	6B	how bout , what do you think for the other one ?
1	6B	s_t_d education ?
1	6B	okay okay , so there 's our seven .
0	6B	okay , recreation and public services . stray cat spaying .
1	6B	i do n't know . it does n't seem like it would be that big of a problem .
1	6B	could be like -
1	6B	i 've never seen cats get too outta control .
1	6B	you know what i mean ? so - uh , maybe .
0	6B	um , public news .
1	6B	yeah i like that trunc seem good ? okay .
0	6B	so we have public news , foodbank -
1	6B	i like the idea of a food bank . um , that 's two . a junior soccar league .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	possibly .
1	6B	it 's nice to have like services for kids in a community , but -
1	6B	could be a loxory .
0	6B	kitten trunc kitten and puppy adoption .
1	6B	i tend to like -
2	6B	i tend to , like , favor humans over animals , you know - know so , if it came trunc down to it , i 'd probably choose the soccar league over that one .
1	6B	maybe neither of those .
1	6B	what do you think ?
1	6B	okay .
0	6B	um , okay . so we have soup kitchens .
2	6B	say yeah , so there 's three . um , definitely housing assistance ? okay , yeah . that 's a good one . dog catcher ?
1	6B	i do n't know .
0	6B	uh .
2	6B	yeah , it seems kinda unnecessary .
1	6B	skip it and come back ? okay . boys basketball club .
1	6B	um , maybe ?
1	6B	kinda falls into the soccer league category .
0	6B	uh , public access station .
0	6B	i 'm not sure either . the only thing i can think of is like -
0	6B	uh , like a lodge where you could go get your information .
0	6B	type thing .
2	6B	yeah , let 's pass on that .
0	6B	reusable bag campaign .
2	6B	uh hhh .
1	6B	maybe ?
0	6B	okay . veterinary hospital ?
1	6B	that seems -
2	6B	you 'd think so . yeah .
1	6B	so , maybe cut that one from our public service type thing ?
1	6B	okay , football stadium upkeep .
1	6B	i would say -
1	6B	right .
0	6B	and pest control .
2	6B	yeah , right . does n't that seem like it would be a private type of thing ?
1	6B	okay , so pass on that one .
0	6B	okay , so we have -
0	6B	public news , foodbank -
0	6B	um -
0	6B	soup kitchen housing . yeah .
0	6B	and then -
1	6B	looks like we could do the -
1	6B	kitten and puppy adoption ?
1	6B	and then maybe the things for the kids ? the junior soccar league , and basketball club ?
1	6B	sound good ?
0	6B	okay .
0	6B	okay .
0	6B	infrastucture and licensing .
0	6B	uh , teaching certificates .
1	6B	interesting .
1	6B	seems like it could be a private thing too .
2	6B	so , maybe not there . um , speed limit signs . yeah definitely . additional bus stops .
2	6B	guess it depends on how much of a concern , like the traffic , and - it 's pretty bad here , so that might be helpful .
1	6B	so yeah .
0	6B	okay , uh , those two . tattoo artist licenses .
2	6B	no .
2	6B	yeah , i do n't know trunc it 's a tough one .
1	6B	does n't it seem like it could be a private thing too ?
1	6B	so maybe we 'll come back to these ones if we do n't get seven . um -
0	6B	boating licenses .
1	6B	yeah , it does .
1	6B	i guess pass on that one . uh , pothole maintenance .
2	6B	uh , definitely . that 's - that 's important one . okay , so those three . subway system .
0	6B	uh -
2	6B	pretty nice to have a subway .
2	6B	let 's throw that one on there . okay , hunting tags .
2	6B	kinda goes into the same as the ones above , so not , um - towing services .
2	6B	hhh does n't seem like a - like it needs to be a government thing .
1	6B	okay , how bout massage certificates ? flagpole repair ?
2	6B	i trunc that one seems -
1	6B	well i do n't know .
2	6B	seems kind of an odd one , does n't it ? like - maybe that could be a private -
1	6B	like company for somebody .
2	6B	uh - trunc i would n't want my public government to be paying for that .
1	6B	i do n't think .
0	6B	okay , taxi stops .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	what 's that ?
2	6B	so maybe not on that one .
2	6B	uh , fishing licensing . same as before . okay , public bus upkeep .
2	6B	yeah , i 'd say that too . so that 'd be five , and then drainage ditches .
2	6B	i 'd think so especially since it rains so much here . trunc that would make sense . okay , so there 's six .
1	6B	which of these is not like the other for you ?
1	6B	um , okay let 's see .
1	6B	i 'm thinking like -
1	6B	flagpole repair , towing services -
1	6B	and teaching certificates .
1	6B	kay , teaching certificates you think ?
1	6B	okay , yeah .
1	6B	education 's important .
2	6B	okay i think that 's our seven .
0	6B	is that everything ?
1	6B	good job .
2	6B	that 's kinda fun .
