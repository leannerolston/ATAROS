0	3I	empty plastic jugs . um -

0	3I	large cups . 
2	3I	this aisle is getting neglected . 
2	3I	okay , sure . um - let's be non-committal and put it in the middle .

2	3I	let's put it next to refrigerator magnets . 
0	3I	bagels .

1	3I	maybe next to the paper . 
1	3I	uh - 
1	3I	like right here ? 
1	3I	okay . 
2	3I	think that 's it with these . these are all sorta not really stocked very well but - 
1	3I	yep . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	um - 
2	6B	sugar free juice machines , that seems , like , a little non-essential . um - 
0	6B	i - i don't know . 
2	6B	but it seems like - since it's - 
0	6B	it's trunc it's - either - 
0	6B	teaching people - it's probably teaching people how to - 
0	6B	be assistant cooks , or at least employing people . 
0	6B	so - 
0	6B	i don't know . 
1	6B	yeah we - trunc it says we  must discuss each item and reach an agreement about whether - to cut it or to continue funding . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	assistant cooks , that one's questionable it sounds like . um . sex ed - 
1	6B	yeah , i think so too . uh , custodians - 
2	6B	yeah , yeah . definitely . 
2	6B	who else is gonna clean up ? cuz no one cleans up after themselves . um , speech therapy ? 
1	6B	yeah . football equipment ? 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	question mark . um , acting coaches ? 
1	6B	yeah , unless , like , we 're trying to preserve the arts . um - 
1	6B	yeah . cooking classes . uh , note takers , disability services , um - 
1	6B	i think that if - that should stay probably if - especially if we 're gonna keep the special ed . 
2	6B	stuff , um - sugar free juice machines , i still uh , i question the essential ness of that one . um - 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	music teachers . 
1	6B	i think we should keep those . 
0	6B	um . so - 
0	6B	what were the things we had questions marks next to ? sugar free juice machines . 
0	6B	uh - 
0	6B	yeah . 
3	6B	trunc i still feel like the sugar free juice machines is , like - why not just put water fountains , you know ? 
3	6B	and then we have zero calories instead of , you know , like some artificial juice . 
0	6B	okay . um - 
0	6B	maybe they 're actually teaching you how - 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	um - 
1	6B	yeah - 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	invasive species removal . 
2	6B	yeah , s_t_d_ education  needs to stay . 
0	6B	uh , toxic waste disposal . 
1	6B	mm-hm , hospital additions . 
2	6B	um . what's the budget for that anymore ? um - 
2	6B	question mark , i think , even though it's probably important . uh , needle exchange . 
1	6B	i think that should stay , um - 
0	6B	sex offender database . 
1	6B	yeah , veteran's medical assistance . i think so . weed control ? 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	yeah , we can make that - uh , weeds are trunc invasive species . let's consider it that . prenatal check-ups . yeah . neighborhood watch - 
1	6B	it sounds like weed control is the one to go . 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	um - 
2	6B	yeah , or else it's , uh - or else like what trunc then cats would be just , you know , reproducing everywhere , and you have a bunch of cats - 
0	6B	uh , community news ads ? 
2	6B	who - does that anymore ? like , don't people use twitter , or something else ? 
1	6B	i don't know . uh , the food bank needs - yeah , junior soccer league - 
1	6B	yeah , kitten and puppy adoption . 
2	6B	yeah . i mean or else the - the pounds are gonna - 
2	6B	get filled up . soup kitchens , yeah . 
1	6B	dog catcher , yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . i think so . 
0	6B	um - 
0	6B	i guess it's like - 
0	6B	uh - 
0	6B	u_ dub broadcasts some lectures or something . maybe it's like that . 
0	6B	like it's - 
0	6B	just a local cable thingy . 
1	6B	i don't know question - question mark , like , on that one . um - 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	mm . 
1	6B	yeah , pest control . yeah . 
2	6B	i think it's because we don't really know what community news ads are , or the public access station - 
0	6B	um . 
2	6B	i think that the community news ads would - are like - 
2	6B	would become less essential . 
2	6B	moving into the future , so let's cut that one . 
0	6B	um - 
1	6B	infrastructure and licensing . teaching certificates needs to stay . 
1	6B	yeah , additional bus stops . mm-hm . 
2	6B	why do we need additional bus stops ? question mark . tattoo artist licenses . yeah boating licenses . 
1	6B	yeah . pothole maintenance . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	subway system . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	hunting tags , yeah . 
1	6B	mmhm . 
1	6B	yeah . i - i don't know . 
0	6B	um , is it like for - ? 
0	6B	like registered massage therapists . like trunc like that work in chiropractor offices , and stuff ? 
0	6B	um , taxi stops . 
1	6B	sounds kind of important . 
0	6B	like , trunc there are some places on the road that are designated taxi stops instead of parking spaces , like usually they 're in front of like clubs or - and stuff like that , or at the airport . 
1	6B	so , i guess that 's kind of important . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	yeah , i guess i 've seen them , like - 
2	6B	i saw a few in boston once , or like in summerville , which is just outside boston , but i guess its not really , like ,  that essential . i 'm sure that the city will , you know , move on , like without trunc the taxi stops cuz the trunc the parking spaces that open up could generate more revenue . 
1	6B	so , we can question mark on that one . 
1	6B	mm-hm . 
1	6B	yeah . but - 
0	6B	so - 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	yeah , weed control . 
0	6B	trunc community news ads and taxi stops . 
2	6B	we probably didn't cut that much out of the budget , but you know what ? that 's - that was the minimum that they were asking . 
1	6B	i think that 's it .
