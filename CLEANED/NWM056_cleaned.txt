0	3I	well that 's - that 's sort of a - 
1	3I	camping , or sundries thing . 
1	3I	might be easier if we , like , s- 
2	3I	cuz she trunc they didn't say that we had to do it in any order . i would say maybe start with the food items . trunc that seems to trunc make more sense , because these are  hard , i don't know where these are gonna go . 
2	3I	cuz i - you know - trunc i don't think there was any rule that said - 
2	3I	there , there 's a food item . i would put that with the food items . 
2	3I	sugar and ice cream . 
1	3I	yeah . 
2	3I	uh , we have soybeans , trunc maybe here ? oh , oh i see , so we have cake mix over here . 
2	3I	so in a  real grocery store , where would the dried figs be ? i don't know . um - 
2	3I	would be with the trunc so it would be the trunc flour and sugar and things like that , right ? 
2	3I	but we can't move them . 
2	3I	okay . cuz the sugar is and the cake mix is there .  i 'd put them together . 
2	3I	yeah , in a real grocery store they 'd be in the same aisle . 
1	3I	hm ? that sounds good . cuz it - they 're both sort of baking supplies . 
0	3I	um . 
2	3I	well how bout this , fishing net and boating supplies ? you think those make trunc make sense ? okay . 
0	3I	so looks like we have - 
0	3I	um - 
1	3I	pouches of oatmeal , okay , that would be dried - dried things . trunc maybe with the - 
2	3I	okay , see the problem here is th- 
2	3I	the  eggs , that would be trunc like , with the  dairy - dairy , refrigerator . ice cream and eggs should be together . i 'd put them together , but - 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	well , um i guess it trunc could go either here or here , no ? 
2	3I	yeah . cuz trunc the baking - baking supplies should all be together . in a  real grocery store they would be . okay um bagels . 
1	3I	okay . 
1	3I	well why don't we put them - yeah , not really , but - 
1	3I	like , there ? 
1	3I	okay . 
1	3I	in a real grocery store , you wouldn't have soybeans and bagels together . 
0	3I	beets ! okay . 
0	3I	mm-hm , mm-hm . 
2	3I	sure . i trunc they 'd go with soybeans , right ? i mean - although , in trunc reality , beets would be in with the - with the produce . 
1	3I	and soybeans would be - are dry . 
2	3I	yeah , maybe if we could make a little produce aisle down there . okay . um - 
1	3I	i think there were a lot of - 
0	3I	of food items , but i don't see the food items here . trunc i don't think they 're - 
2	3I	fish hooks ! there we go there 's a - there 's anatural fit for fish hooks right next to the fishing net . 
2	3I	mm ! how bout trunc with the bagels ? 
1	3I	that would make sense , huh ? 
0	3I	liters of water . do we have any - 
0	3I	any , um - 
0	3I	mm trunc we don't really have anything . okay . 
0	3I	do we have trunc  clothing items yet , we don't have clothing items , do we ? 
1	3I	we need to create our own little clothing trunc where would you like to put the clothing section in this store ? 
1	3I	we could just start one . 
1	3I	okay . sounds good to me . 
1	3I	there we go . 
1	3I	like school supplies . 
1	3I	mm , yeah . 
1	3I	sure . 
2	3I	yeah ! yeah . 
0	3I	hm . 
2	3I	okay , that 's a good one . power cords and small saws , how about that ? hardware . 
0	3I	books of matches . hm . 
1	3I	mm-hm . 
2	3I	but unfortunately we have siding . 
2	3I	and trunc i don't think we 're supposed to go above this line , that 's - 
1	3I	sure ! 
1	3I	sure . 
1	3I	yeah . 
0	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	okay . okay . 
2	3I	um - oh ! good . so , we have - 
2	3I	we can add to our clothing - clothing area , there . our hats and sweaters . 
0	3I	hm . 
1	3I	trunc how bout , yeah , toiletries ? 
2	3I	face cream would be considered a toiletry . 
0	3I	hm . 
0	3I	oh , we had something for , like - 
2	3I	uh uh face cream ! there we go . face cream , bars of soap . 
2	3I	these are gonna gonna get -  hopefully get easier as we get more on the board . 
2	3I	oh , um how bout right there ? 
2	3I	yeah . yeah , this should - oh , trunc scissors ! scissors would go with school supplies , wouldn't it ? 
1	3I	like , books of matches and loose-leaf paper ? 
2	3I	mm-hm , again , toiletries . 
0	3I	mm-hm . 
1	3I	half-inch - socks ! boy , i 'm getting easy ones here . 
1	3I	tow ropes . that would be hardware . 
1	3I	our hardware section is either gonna be maybe in here , or down here ? 
1	3I	i don't know what do you think ? 
1	3I	right there ? 
1	3I	yeah , that makes sense . 
0	3I	mm-hm . packages of cookies . we had some food here , didn't we ? 
1	3I	sugar ! sugar sugar and ice cream and packages of cookies . that 's where all the kids are gonna hang out , right up there . 
0	3I	mm , okay . 
0	3I	we haven't - 
0	3I	gotten , like , gardening supplies yet . 
2	3I	mousetraps , yeah . 
1	3I	trunc trunc but that 's - that 's - you 'd - you 'd expect to find those , like , at a lowe's , or home depot , right ? 
1	3I	yeah . yeah . 
1	3I	mm-hm , mm-hm . 
1	3I	it's always good when i find one that 's - that 's obvious . 
1	3I	fleece-lined boots . to go with the socks and thick sweaters . 
1	3I	camping ? 
1	3I	but did we have a camping area yet ? 
0	3I	not really . 
0	3I	fishing . 
0	3I	well we  know - 
0	3I	from the list that there 's some camping supplies , right ? 
0	3I	in - in there somewhere . 
1	3I	travel guides . sure , why not . 
1	3I	sure . 
1	3I	bottles of juice . that should be pretty easy , huh ? 
0	3I	um . 
2	3I	eggs are sorta down there by themself . that makes sense because trunc refrigerated . 
2	3I	so you wouldn't - 
2	3I	you wouldn't - 
2	3I	cuz the ice cream and the eggs make sense . those would be together . 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	how bout if we put it right here ? then we sort of hedge our bets , we might have something better there . 
1	3I	mm-hm , mm-hm . 
1	3I	mm-hm yep . that 's where i woulda put it . woops ! oh , that 's okay ! that 's okay . clean up , right . that 's appropriate for what we 're doing . 
1	3I	that 's okay . they 're all gonna get put up anyway . bundles of sticks . 
2	3I	yeah , why not ? right here . 
1	3I	right here . sure . 
1	3I	mm , food ? 
1	3I	sure . 
1	3I	that sounds good . 
0	3I	hm . 
0	3I	electric heaters . 
1	3I	here maybe ? 
1	3I	or here . 
1	3I	which - which do you think is more appropriate ? 
1	3I	okay . 
1	3I	yeah . 
0	3I	mm-hm . 
1	3I	yep . oh i already have one - good one . chocolate bars . i 'd put them maybe up with the sugar and the cookies . and the  doughnuts . 
2	3I	bagels . large vests , i 'm gonna put that here with the - with clothing . 
1	3I	large cups . okay , that would be , like - 
2	3I	yeah ! 
2	3I	sure ! that would be , like , the dry goods cups and plates an- 
0	3I	kay , pre-cut wood , i 'm - 
1	3I	be inclined to maybe put that  here , along with the bundles of  sticks . 
1	3I	mm mm-hm , mm-hm , mm-hm . 
2	3I	wetsuits . now that 's gonna be - 
2	3I	i woulda put it here , but we have siding here . 
2	3I	how bout if we put it here - ? 
1	3I	because in a way cookstoves , wetsuits , boating supplies . 
1	3I	yeah , because - 
0	3I	i would guess five-pound weights - they 're - that 's trunc that 's too much for , like , a fishing weight , so i would have to guess it's , like , a dumbbell for weightlifting kinda thing . 
1	3I	yeah . 
0	3I	mm-hm , mm-hm . 
1	3I	okay . 
0	3I	mm-hm . 
1	3I	unfortunately , i don't know where books might go . where would books go ? toys , maybe ? 
1	3I	maybe right here ? 
1	3I	right there . 
2	3I	definitely . eggs trunc absolutely . absolutely . 
0	3I	liters of water . 
2	3I	do we have any other - oh bottles of juice ! there we go . 
1	3I	oh , how bout right there ? 
2	3I	these are gonna get harder . tweezers . 
0	3I	uh , do we - where are the scissors ? 
2	3I	how bout right here ? 
2	3I	well this would be more toiletries , right ? 
2	3I	i think it would - yeah , you 're right , it would go here , wouldn't it ? it would go with the trunc the small toiletries . 
2	3I	mm-hm . mm-hm , trunc refrigerator magnets cups , yep . 
0	3I	okay , the box cutter . box cutting knives . um . 
1	3I	here ? 
1	3I	okay . 
0	3I	shoelaces . 
2	3I	um , well , in a - in a - i 'm thinking , in a real grocery store , wouldn't the shoelaces be in , like , this kind of an area ? 
1	3I	or not ? 
1	3I	sort of shoe polish , tweezers - 
2	3I	yeah i trunc and just - thinking about a  real grocery store , i think that 's where they 'd be . cushions for deck chairs . hm . 
2	3I	now that 's a hard one , because we don't really have - 
1	3I	well , what about somewhere in here ? 
0	3I	backpacks . 
1	3I	yeah sure , sure , that 's a good spot for it right there . 
0	3I	buckets . 
0	3I	hm . 
1	3I	we have all the food over there so it's not gonna fit there . 
0	3I	buckets . 
0	3I	mm-hm . 
0	3I	our aisle is - is - has been used up . i guess the rule was once we put it down we can't move it . 
0	3I	was - wasn't that the rule ? 
0	3I	okay . 
1	3I	well , i think the rule was trunc trunc what trunc trunc if it was already there we couldn't move it but i think we can move our own stuff . 
1	3I	yeah , i think we - 
1	3I	i think so i think so . i don't think that 's - 
1	3I	inappropriate . 
1	3I	mm-hm , mm-hm . 
1	3I	yeah , we 're just making room for one more . empty plastic jugs . 
1	3I	that 's sort of a - 
1	3I	could go - 
1	3I	i would argue that one might be something like camping supplies or something . 
1	3I	but we 've - we 've sorta run outta space for camping supplies . 
1	3I	kay . 
2	3I	okay . trunc we 're - we 're - we have a - yeah . heavy cable . again , now . we 're sort of heavy on the hardware . 
1	3I	yeah . 
2	3I	well - 
2	3I	it sounds like we need to create another section . 
2	3I	because otherwise we 're - without moving things - 
2	3I	we have - we have room here . why don't we just start sort of a catch all category here ? 
2	3I	okay , unfortunately , that 's trunc the heavy coats belongs here , so let's move - let's move this . trunc make a little room . 
0	3I	there . 
2	3I	now , it  should have it's own section . i mean , really . 
2	3I	is it - the wine and things usually gets its own section , right ? 
2	3I	you don't put it with - with other things , so - it gets its own section . okay , we 're done ! 
0	6B	okay , so . 
1	6B	we can be generous and not - you know cut three or four things . 
0	6B	mm . 
2	6B	acting coaches . yeah . 
2	6B	trunc see , trunc classes , acting coaches . i would say that acting coaches - i mean , i know the school of drama would disagree with us , but i really don't see how public funds should be spent on acting coaches . 
2	6B	oh , i assume this is a city department , right ? this is - we 're - we 're essentially working for a city . i think an acting coach is trunc something that could be cut . 
2	6B	okay , so we 're cutting one there at least okay . second column um - 
0	6B	hm . 
2	6B	i 'm not quite sure how weed control is a public health issue . i mean , if there 's too many weeds in public areas , how does that jeopardize people's health ? 
2	6B	i would too . you know , i could argue that if it's in a play area with  children , you don't want toxic weed killers all over the grass anyway , if they 're  playing on the grass . 
2	6B	so  i would say no to the weed control . okay , recreation and public services . um - 
0	6B	i don't know ! 
0	6B	a public  access station . 
0	6B	trunc i - that 's the only thing i can think is a public access - would that be , like , a place where you would go to get information about your community services or something ? 
0	6B	like a - like a - a community center ? where they would have - literature and handouts , like , for instance , voting pamphlets and things like that , you would get normally at a library ? 
2	6B	since - since neither one of us knows what a public access station is , i think we could probably cut it . unless somebody can tell us what it is . 
0	6B	mm-hm ? 
1	6B	community news ads , yeah . i agree . like , one of these - these circulars that you get on your doorstep trunc that 's full of ads and nothing much else except ads . okay . so , we trunc we 're doing , um - 
0	6B	acting coaches , weed control , and public access station okay , infrastructure and licensing . 
1	6B	well , this is gonna show my bias , but what about tattoo artist licenses ? 
2	6B	i 'm not a big fan of tattoos . 
1	6B	but , there again , it's a - 
2	6B	well - okay , i 'm gonna trunc i 'm gonna back - backtrack . i think tattoo artists  should be licensed , because it means that they 're up to standards . public health standards , so i - i will - i 'm gonna trunc back - back - go back on that . i think they  should be licensed . 
2	6B	i would hate to think that they 're  unlicensed , and their - their equipment is - is not - not hygienic . um , so , how bout - ? yeah , massage certificates . 
0	6B	mm-hm . 
1	6B	mm-hm ! 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	why is the  city paying to  certify massage therapists ? 
1	6B	for the same reason , why are they paying for the , uh - acting coaches ? 
0	6B	okay . so , we picked one from each column . 
1	6B	i think we 're done !
