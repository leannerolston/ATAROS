1	3I	okay . uh , let's take two or three and work - work a group . 
1	3I	i have five pound weights , and i think those go with mouse traps , or boating supplies . somewhere on this side . 
1	3I	and i don't much care where . do you think - care where ? 
1	3I	right . so let's essentially put it up here . i won't put it right next - it is a boating supply . we 'll put it - part of it . okay . your turn . 
1	3I	no , but i think it - mouse trunc sort of household equipment . 
2	3I	or power cords . 
1	3I	oh , i think power cords sounds good . 
1	3I	sure . 
2	3I	a package of cookies . now we hafta - i think it goes with the ice cream . totally good . 
1	3I	that was a good idea . 
1	3I	alright that goes up here . 
1	3I	okay , bundles of sticks . i think this goes with mouse traps . it's sort - well it's because , um , i think these bundles of sticks are for starting fires . and it's sort of - 
1	3I	things that you use in your house , or your farm , or whatever that are not - 
0	3I	and you thought it was camping . 
1	3I	well , that would be okay with me . 
2	3I	why don't we save it . - and see where we have space . my next one is books , and i think that goes with the travel guides . or the toys , but let's - 
2	3I	they 're right at - but you know they 're - i know but they 're - see , they 're right across the aisle . 
0	3I	okay . 
0	3I	mouse traps . 
1	3I	sort of household equipment , yeah . choo 
1	3I	tow ropes . and i 'm gonna put that with boating . 
1	3I	i 'm gonna save bundles of sticks - 
1	3I	so , that 's like um hardware i think . 
1	3I	sure . 
2	3I	and bundles of sticks should go - when we get to the camping equipment , which we haven't got yet , we 'll put this with that . 
1	3I	so i 'm gonna get us more here . cuz i 'm holding on to this one . 
1	3I	that 's the gardening stuff . do we have any - ? we have nothing for gardening . 
1	3I	well , i would put it here . m- 
2	3I	okay . so here is our two camping things . backpacks - unless we 're gonna say backpacks are school supplies . in which case they should be near toys and books maybe . and then i think there 's going to be paper in there . 
2	3I	let's decide they 're school supplies . 
2	3I	yeah but target or - uh - yeah , but target has , uh , everything . 
2	3I	let's - we 're gonna have school supplies in this area . 
0	3I	okay . your turn . 
1	3I	yep . 
0	3I	liters of water . 
0	3I	liter - 
2	3I	uh , a whole liter is pretty big . it could either be drinking water - we can put it over here . or it could be like for , um - 
0	3I	uh , distilled water for - 
0	3I	things you use - you know , your iron , and stuff . 
1	3I	yeah . it could be anyway . 
1	3I	sure . 
2	3I	yep , for sure that goes there . trunc uh-oh , we haven't left any room for this . 
1	3I	i don't - i can't move it once i put it up . 
2	3I	i 'm good at - alright , we have not left any place for clothes . 
0	3I	so - 
1	3I	i think maybe opposite - over here . because we haven't really got another aisle for it . we don't want em with sugar and cake mixes if we don't - can help it . do we ? 
2	3I	yeah . so it could be - i don't want it by siding , much . i 'd rather have it opposite boating . 
1	3I	i don't know . what do you think ? 
2	3I	we 're gonna have a lot of clothes . i mean three or four things it seems to me . socks , vests - 
1	3I	so it's gonna be arbitrary . is what it comes down to . we could have it - 
2	3I	no . but - we could have it - 
1	3I	sort of opposite here because this is personal things , and clothes are personal . 
2	3I	i mean it's not trunc it's not - i wouldn't organize a store this way , but we 're sorta stuck . 
2	3I	or we could put it below here . i don't remember - 
2	3I	thick - or we could put thick sweaters over with camping , when we get to camping . 
2	3I	do you want to do that and have the - ? truncnah . alright , so i have light jackets . 
1	3I	trunc well , let's put it right here . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	okay , so i put up two because it had two . 
1	3I	yeah . 
2	3I	good . and trunc they can go up opposite if we need to . rolls of duct tape is gonna go with mouse traps . 
0	3I	okay . 
2	3I	i don't know what that is for but - i guess it's a supply . 
1	3I	oh , okay . 
0	3I	okay . 
1	3I	so now i have small axes . and i trunc i think we 're gonna put camping up here , right ? 
1	3I	may i put sticks up there too ? 
0	3I	kay . 
1	3I	okay . 
0	3I	alright . 
0	3I	socks . 
2	3I	or one of - one of the - or one of those little trunc twirly things , you know . 
2	3I	alright ,  now . large cups . and i think that goes by toilet paper . i 'm assuming these are paper cups . 
1	3I	what do you think they are ? kitchen equipment ? 
1	3I	refrigerator magnets ? 
1	3I	we don't have anything else like that yet . 
1	3I	well , it could be - 
2	3I	or could be down here . 
1	3I	i don't remember anything else like this . do you ? 
0	3I	well , toilet paper is paper goods . 
0	3I	paper cup . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	so , we 're gonna assume that . 
1	3I	if there 's a test , we 'll explain our thinking . 
0	3I	oh . 
1	3I	put em with camping . 
1	3I	with the sticks and the axe and - but not with siding oh gosh 
1	3I	it's okay . alright , tweezers - it's okay . tweezers should be going with the toilet paper , and mint toothpaste , but we 've run out of space . so i 'm gonna - 
1	3I	put this up a little bit . 
0	3I	okay . 
1	3I	it's gonna be opposite the other clothes cuz we 're gonna run out of space . and my heavy coats are gonna be there . oh , and lucky me . 
1	3I	alright . now we get to decide on chocolate bars . and i think it's gonna be opposite - at the top . right over here , next to ice cream . 
0	3I	okay . 
3	3I	oh yes ! right there ! excellent . excellent . alright ,  beets . that goes down here with soy beans . okay . 
0	3I	yeah . 
2	3I	yeah , trunc i wish we could put it down here . 
1	3I	but it's okay . 
2	3I	i - i thought it was whatever - i wish - it's - tweezers and face cream should go together . we 're gonna do that . 
1	3I	how's that ? 
1	3I	alright so , egg timers . and - we do - we have it - we don't  yet have a cooking equipment - oh , cake mixes . yeah , sure . or it could go by the eggs . 
1	3I	yes . alright here we go . 
1	3I	perfect . bottles of  juice . 
1	3I	over here . let's do that . 
1	3I	that can - yep . yep . that 's fine . or they could go with the mouse traps and stuff , but this is fine . fleece lined boots , that 's our clothing aisle , here . 
0	3I	okay . 
2	3I	yeah . uh , yeah , or soy beans . sort of , um , bulk foods . 
1	3I	toasted kinds . yeah . so we don't know . but that 's fine . it's sort of the raw foods section . small saws . now these are gonna go with siding . 
1	3I	okay ? 
2	3I	no . well , but we 're going to with - the peat moss is down here , so that 's close enough . okay . 
1	3I	yep . 
1	3I	yep . 
0	3I	trunc whiskey . 
3	3I	 cases . what - or with the juice and the water . 
1	3I	yeah . 
2	3I	we - trunc you know what we need is - you know what they call end caps ? that 's what's at the end of each aisle . i know . and it's what they want you to buy on impulse . we need to put that - chocolate - that 's right . let's do it . 
1	3I	and if they don't not understand it we 'll explain it . 
0	3I	okay . 
1	3I	hm . sure . 
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs . 
2	3I	ah , yeah we should . 
1	3I	okay , so these cushions for deck chairs are gonna go up here and - and they 're gonna be , like , on the end cap . okay . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	sure . 
1	3I	we - we know we have cake coming along , so we got ta save space . so here is bars of soap and they need to go with this stuff . 
1	3I	but not with the - 
2	3I	clothes . yeah perfect .  perfect ! okay . 
1	3I	yeah . fine . 
1	3I	fish hooks . well we 've got all this stuff but - but i - i know . so i 'm gonna overlap it a little bit . trunc let's do that . 
0	3I	trunc small axes . okay . 
1	3I	school supplies . 
1	3I	yeah , let's put it here . 
2	3I	uh , that 'll do . or next to power cords . 
1	3I	yeah , put it right there . 
2	3I	unless you want that over here . 
1	3I	okay . 
1	3I	sure . 
1	3I	that 's fine . 
1	3I	we are running out here . 
1	3I	oh . well , that 's a camping thing . that 's for carrying things with you . 
2	3I	okay , i think that 's - we 've done it ! 
2	3I	stuff at all . yeah , it's okay . i - i - i think i really would rather have these things with the siding but it - we 're not gonna move em . 
1	3I	well , the - all of these sort of household things , but trunc it doesn't really matter . it's fine . 
1	3I	no . 
1	3I	that 's right . 
0	3I	mm-hm . 
1	3I	they 'll just have to live with our ca- 
1	3I	don't make any sense . 
2	3I	where did we put the cups ? over here ? we could 've put em with those things over there . the liquids . 
0	3I	uh-huh . 
1	3I	i hink we 're breaking the rules . i think we 're not supposed to move things around . 
2	3I	i know . that 's right . we have haven't handed anybody a - a map yet . 
1	3I	right , i 'm content now at this - 
0	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	we could shop here , trunc rena . 
0	3I	okay ! 
0	3I	time's up ! 
1	6B	so , how are we gonna go about this ? 
1	6B	okay . let's start with recreation program . trunc and public service list . 
1	6B	let's the football stadium too . 
1	6B	right ? 
1	6B	let's look at this  whole list . 
0	6B	trunc recreation and public services . right . 
1	6B	right . 
1	6B	well , that 's something i think that people will pick up too . 
0	6B	what is community news and ads ? 
1	6B	let's pick one list - 
1	6B	alright , let's pick one list and go through it and decide - 
1	6B	what we absolutely can not cut - 
1	6B	trunc once we 've got a number - 
1	6B	of items . on a list , then we can see if we can make the others fit it . 
0	6B	alright , stray cat spaying . 
0	6B	so we have to - 
1	6B	cut the whole program ? 
2	6B	if i have to choose between stray cat spaying and community news i trunc i 'd pick trunc spaying the cats although how they 'll know about it when we can't tell them anything , i don't know . 
1	6B	food bank , no . 
1	6B	we keep that . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	kitten and puppy adoption . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	soup kitchens trunc the public might pick up . it's possible that the churches will pick up . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	possibly . 
1	6B	so , the junior soccer league maybe . 
2	6B	or trunc i think we 've agreed on that . 
2	6B	the community news , if we absolutely have to . 
2	6B	soup kitchen if we absolutely have to - no - 
1	6B	trunc trunc and i - i don't know , you probably get something from your city council member . 
1	6B	that is more about how he voted , and what he's doing for you . 
1	6B	let's - 
1	6B	do - i mean we can always put it back - let's say community news goes . 
1	6B	kitten and puppy adoption , i just think - 
2	6B	would be a real last choice - 
2	6B	yeah . soup kitchens might get picked up by somebody else . housing assistance has to happen . 
1	6B	yep . i think that the dog catcher has to happen . 
1	6B	sure . 
1	6B	that 's right . 
2	6B	so , i don't think that the county - 
1	6B	pays very much for basketball clubs . i think that can go . 
1	6B	the public access station , let's assume that is wi-fi and internet access . 
2	6B	no trunc i trunc do you think that 's it ? 
2	6B	not channel nine . it may be that trunc you know channel twenty-seven or something like that ? 
1	6B	let that go . 
1	6B	that 's not useful . 
0	6B	right . 
0	6B	yep . 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	now - 
1	6B	and maybe the football stadium . 
1	6B	alright , so we 're gonna trunc aim for four or five on one of these other lists . 
1	6B	take your pick . 
1	6B	see , i think it's gonna get harder when we get into some of these things . 
1	6B	well , let's do infrastructure and licensing , and i say take out tattoo artist licenses . 
1	6B	yeah , i know . 
2	6B	i trunc i wouldn't take out anything on that list if i could help it . 
1	6B	oh , yeah . i 'd take out taxi stops . 
1	6B	i 'd take out - trunc how much does that cost ? 
0	6B	additional bus stops . 
1	6B	we wouldn't have to - we couldn't have to do that . 
0	6B	uh , yes . 
0	6B	so that if you go to a licensed massage person , they 've had some training . 
1	6B	i would only take two out of that list . 
1	6B	the taxi stops and the additional bus stops . 
1	6B	so , now let's go - 
1	6B	to one of these other trunc trunc if we only have to take two out of this list , what are the two ? 
1	6B	and keep the community news . 
2	6B	and the public access station . isn't that redundant , kind of ? 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	or we keep the public - well - 
2	6B	i 'd let the public access station go . it's got ta cost more than the community news . 
2	6B	i might be tempted - i were only gonna do two , i might be tempted to trunc take both of those . 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	stuff . 
1	6B	we have to sort of know what kind of a county we are in . is this a county like seattle , where - like king county where many city that provide services or are we - is it a county like - ? 
0	6B	like whatcom county or - ? 
0	6B	island . 
0	6B	i live in king county . 
2	6B	alright , we 're gonna assume it's king county , and that there  are services provided by the city . 
2	6B	and by other agencies , like the boys and girls club , so let's take out the junior soccer league , and the boys basketball club . 
2	6B	and keep all the informational things , so we 're only doing two , right ? 
0	6B	alright . 
1	6B	let's do what ? public health ? 
1	6B	and you can wait . 
1	6B	awhile . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	well , but that in some ways - but they almost always require matching money i think . 
2	6B	they 're not gonna build the hospital based only on federal money . 
1	6B	they might . 
1	6B	they might . 
2	6B	but we could always postpone a year . 
2	6B	only ? 
1	6B	well , it's king county hospital . 
1	6B	right . 
1	6B	yeah . but i think it- 
1	6B	it used to be king county hospital . is it still ? harborview ? 
0	6B	but it - but it - it is operated by king county , right ? so - 
0	6B	it's own- 
0	6B	oh , right . 
0	6B	right . 
0	6B	state . 
1	6B	institution . it probably gets state money and - 
1	6B	federal money and - 
1	6B	let's see if it 'll come back . 
0	6B	here it is . 
2	6B	well , the trunc but my feeling is that the- 
2	6B	a hospital addition can wait . 
2	6B	that and it's a major capital . 
2	6B	expenditure for - to create a structure . 
1	6B	yeah . and that it's - that - in fact - 
2	6B	trunc it doesn't belong in the same budget as all these operating , on going expense - 
2	6B	budget , so let's take hospital additions out . 
1	6B	we got ta come up with a second thing though , if we 're gonna stick to our two items . 
0	6B	how much veteran's - how many - ch - medical assistance does the county put in to veterans ? or is that a federal thing ? yeah . 
1	6B	i hate - i hate to do that but i - 
0	6B	i don't know how much is there but - 
1	6B	on that principle that - we know there is at least one other provider . 
2	6B	it's not like we 're cutting s- 
1	6B	no matter what we do . 
2	6B	well then , you know , the toxic waste disposal fall in federal too . 
1	6B	well , that 's true , 
1	6B	they do . 
1	6B	and your neon bulbs - 
0	6B	oh . yeah . yeah . 
1	6B	actually , where you are there 's a great place . it's called - 
0	6B	um . total reclaim , or something like that . it's on sixth avenue , down there in - at sodo . and , you can take anything in there . 
2	6B	it's really great . i , you know i once took a little bag with two little neon bulbs , but you can take a computer . i had a kitchen aid mixer that trunc trunc had totally died , the bearings were totally shot . 
0	6B	any of those electric - and you don't - 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	well this is , this is where if you take a computer to comp u_s_a_ or something like that and pay them a fee - 
0	6B	and i think it's call total reclaim . 
0	6B	so - 
0	6B	alright . 
0	6B	reproductive education . 
1	6B	so who - yeah , we do . so who is this for ? 
2	6B	except it's in public health and safety . 
0	6B	about those things . 
0	6B	right . 
0	6B	right . 
0	6B	and they have - i know they have , um - 
0	6B	nurses in the high schools . 
0	6B	oh . well , i don't know . but they did when my kids were there and , um - 
0	6B	they were , you know real nurses who helped with things like that . 
1	6B	alright , so we 're looking for two items out of this list . 
2	6B	i - uh - i don't know how i feel about neighborhood watch support . i feel like that 's - 
1	6B	you know , the neighbors can watch without county money . 
2	6B	all they have to do is get together and do it . 
2	6B	well - 
0	6B	uh-huh . 
0	6B	uh-huh . 
1	6B	okay , but if we had to take something off of this list and - 
1	6B	yes . 
1	6B	i would do that . 
1	6B	so , we 're gonna do hospital additions and neighborhood watch . 
0	6B	we 're down to only two items , but - 
1	6B	i feel okay about that . 
1	6B	yeah , alright . now we 're gonna look for two over here . 
2	6B	so this sex ed . is gonna be for the kids . this reproductive education is for like - 
1	6B	adults who don't know how to do it . 
1	6B	you think so ? 
0	6B	oh . 
1	6B	okay . alright . 
0	6B	alright . 
1	6B	so , what are we gonna do - ? 
1	6B	over here , under - 
1	6B	okay . 
2	6B	i had a kid - 
1	6B	who wouldn't have finished high school without playing football . 
2	6B	it's something that rots your brain . 
2	6B	and i spent thousands of dollars on it . so , alright , we - but we got ta come up with two things out of this list and there 's nothing on this list that isn't a good thing . 
2	6B	i 'd take out the juice machines . 
1	6B	just because - 
1	6B	and i 'd probably take out cooking classes . 
1	6B	alright . trunc poetry books or cooking classes ? 
1	6B	oh we 're not , oh , i 'm willing to take out - 
1	6B	yeah , so if we take out the juice machines and football we 've done it . 
1	6B	are we wusses cuz we could only come up with two things in each list ? 
2	6B	we can't take out - 
2	6B	custodians . speech therapy . no . no no . 
0	6B	department . 
0	6B	and trunc poetry . 
2	6B	well - 
3	6B	first off , how many new poetry books do they buy every year ? trunc give me a break , i 'm a librarian . they buy , maybe , ten . 
2	6B	it's not gonna save a nickel . 
3	6B	trunc i really don't think so . in - in hind - i mean , i really think that that 's a red herring kind of thing , because it's so trivial in the trunc in the budget of an education program . 
2	6B	and it's not that i don't value poetry books , but we 're saving money , so we can save a hundred buck . 
2	6B	yeah , they 're gonna have poetry books . 
2	6B	well , i 'm a librarian , my kids did too . 
2	6B	cept the one that couldn't read til he was fifteen , but- 
2	6B	okay . i trunc i can live with that . although i 'm willing to defer to football if you 'd rather buy the books . but the football could us five-thousand dollars . 
2	6B	actually , we 'd save a lot more money getting rid of football . 
0	6B	um - 
0	6B	ace hardware . 
0	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	alright , so let's do football , and keep the poetry . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	free . 
0	6B	alright . 
0	6B	yes . 
0	6B	hospital addition . 
0	6B	neighborhood watch , was that the other one ? yes , and keeping veterans . 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	what did we have over here ? 
0	6B	and junior soccer , yeah . 
0	6B	and then under infrastructure , this was our limiting one . 
0	6B	and it was , yeah , gonna be and was - 
0	6B	taxi stops and , uh , additional bus stops . 
1	6B	so we 're not gonna expand anything . 
0	6B	alright . 
1	6B	i 'm content . 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	bail us out ! 
0	6B	oh , she turned off the light . 
1	6B	i know - they don't even care what we did . all they care about is our tone of voice . 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	uh - 
1	6B	uh , football equipment , i think that was a - that 's an easy call . 
1	6B	i think that 's highly likely . 
0	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	and i don't believe they still - trunc trunc trunc roosevelt used to have cooking and sewing , even - well - even when michael was - 
0	6B	um . so he would - he was born in nineteen seventy-eight . 
0	6B	so about nineteen ninety . 
0	6B	trunc trunc no . trunc about two thousand . 
0	6B	but i don't know if they still have it . 
0	6B	wood shop up here . 
0	6B	and they didn't put , um - 
0	6B	okay . heather . we 're done .
