1	3I	yeah , sure .
1	3I	you wan na go first ?
2	3I	um that - that seems like - yeah , just put that next to the boating supplies . i doubt we 'll have anything else that will be there . here , i wan na trunc i wan na do one .
2	3I	i think this would be kind of in the construction area , but close to siding .
2	3I	so i 'm gon na put it , like -
1	3I	well small axes and mousetraps both kill things . how 's this ? is that good ?
1	3I	trunc right there , okay .
2	3I	and this is our edibles , obviously , on the right here .
0	3I	um -
2	3I	well , i mean , this is , like , useless crap , and this is , like , useful crap .
2	3I	so , useful inedible , useless inedible .
2	3I	sure . maybe put it just a little bit closer to toilet paper ?
1	3I	that 's fine with me .
1	3I	okay , so let 's do half-inch tubing . i 'm assuming this is for , like -
1	3I	home improvement , you think ?
0	3I	okay . so -
1	3I	not quite deadly , but construction-ish .
1	3I	yeah , alright .
0	3I	moving on .
2	3I	well , this is in our - let 's put is across from boating supplies , because if you fall off the boat -
2	3I	oh yeah , hey , how bout that ? trunc trunc so maybe , like , traveling stuff . maybe trunc if we ever find car junk , we 'll put it over here .
0	3I	gas-powered cookstoves .
1	3I	trunc trunc yeah , okay . so -
2	3I	we do n't have anything like this , kind of , i do n't think .
0	3I	which is-
0	3I	you think this is , like , a tiny portable one ?
2	3I	alright , if we think it 's a tiny portable one , then maybe we want it next to , like , travel guides ? but , like , on the other side . so this is , like , fishing and then camping .
1	3I	or do you want it over here ? like -
1	3I	put it over here ?
2	3I	just in case we find something else fishing , wan na put it right here ?
1	3I	outdoors . yeah , sounds good to me .
2	3I	that 's gon na be over here , but - but where over here ?
2	3I	so we 've got healthy stuff and unhealthy stuff . and then , the unhealthy stuff mixed together is over here .
1	3I	well , you can use oatmeal to , like , make cookies . do you wan na put this , like over - cuz that 's kind of a trunc uh -
2	3I	yeah . raw materials does n't matter because we see eggs and sugar , like , in a - in different places . i 'm happy with that .
0	3I	books .
0	3I	um .
1	3I	useful trunc crap .
0	3I	huh .
2	3I	we agree that it 's in this one , right ? the middle one ?
2	3I	okay . so trunc maybe we could put it next to toys ! i mean , those trunc trunc they 're for entertainment . so let 's do that .
1	3I	that 's gon na be over here somewhere , right ?
2	3I	yes . put it next to the axes .
2	3I	okay , let 's see . backpacks , that 's traveling stuff . i 'm gon na put it across from the gas-powered cookstove , because -
1	3I	cuz then it 's , like , already on your back trunc you 're looking at cookstoves . i do n't know .
0	3I	uh -
2	3I	so , we have , like , this - i do n't know . this is n't quite arts and crafts yet .
1	3I	i think i 'd put it next to here , with all our sharp things .
2	3I	sharp and potentially deadly things .
1	3I	um across from ice cream , obviously - no . uh -
2	3I	no , this is in fishing supplies .
0	3I	um .
1	3I	we could put like -
2	3I	our unhealthy stuff is , like , kind of in this area . maybe we should just stick it across from the sugar ?
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	right , right . true . like , so this is consumable but where do we want it ? like , how are we ranging this ?
2	3I	like , soybeans are healthy , sugar is not . so this is , like , the unhealthy half , and this is the healthy half .
2	3I	but trunc trunc whiskey 's usually , like , on the end of the aisle do we wan na , like , put it at the end ?
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	oh , that 's gon na be over here somewhere .
2	3I	kind of in the middle , maybe ?
1	3I	what do you think ?
1	3I	yeah , sure .
1	3I	i 'm not really particular about where my bottles of juice go .
0	3I	loose-leaf paper .
1	3I	next to the books , maybe ?
1	3I	yeah , books are made of paper .
2	3I	i do n't know how people shop .
0	3I	um -
1	3I	maybe next to the travel guides . maybe just , like , stick them up here .
1	3I	shoelaces . oh , are we gon na run into clothes ?
2	3I	maybe we should , like , reserve this area for clothes .
1	3I	what do you think ?
1	3I	i do n't know . they trunc it could creep into toys .
2	3I	here , i 'm just gon na stick this , like -
1	3I	trunc ish .
2	3I	and then we can , like , fill this area with other clothes items if we needed .
2	3I	oh next - right here . yeah .
2	3I	that goes with boats .
2	3I	it 's gon na be bad .
0	3I	paper bags .
0	3I	that 's like packing lunches , right ?
2	3I	yeah ! trunc no , that 's a good idea ! i like that idea . i 'm gon na put that here .
1	3I	uh-oh .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	sure . that 's fine .
2	3I	trunc we just - we did the best we could , under the circumstances . socks .
2	3I	right across from shoelaces . maybe up one . just in case we find boots to put there .
0	3I	oh . um -
2	3I	next to our - yeah , next to cord-y thingies .
1	3I	i 'm happy with that like , normally i 'd put that near boating supplies , but whatever .
2	3I	uh , i 'd put that in the healthy section . next to the soybeans , maybe are we allowed to put them down there ?
1	3I	yeah , let 's try to - we 'll trunc we 'll , like scope ourselves between the things .
0	3I	liters of water .
2	3I	next to bottles of juice !
2	3I	that 's how i see - that 's how i see stores .
1	3I	um yeah , maybe put them next to the boots . the fleece-lined boots , because we 're getting into , like -
0	3I	um -
1	3I	this is , like , the warm stuff .
1	3I	like , if you 're going trunc this is the outdoors . and then -
0	3I	books of matches .
2	3I	yeah it would . maybe we just put it next to here . as close to the stove as we could .
0	3I	alright .
0	3I	we go .
1	3I	uh , down here , probably . this is , like toiletries .
1	3I	just in case . alright , sounds good to me .
2	3I	bars of soap just snap that next to the face cream .
0	3I	hm .
2	3I	maybe - we 're kinda going in to kitchen stuff here , like with this - i trunc
1	3I	do you wan na just start trunc doing that here ?
2	3I	but we do have refrigerator magnets here . we could put it over here .
2	3I	trunc no , technically you already put it up , so you ca n't move it .
1	3I	it 's fine , i do n't care . well , i can already see heavy cable , so -
1	3I	put that next to the tow ropes .
1	3I	um well here 's our , like , electric crap
1	3I	put it on the other side of the power cords that would kinda make sense . so you can plug in your electric heater . that makes -
2	3I	exactly !
2	3I	that 's pretty healthy . i 'll put it next to the eggs , cuz they kind of sound the same figs and eggs .
1	3I	um yeah , somewhere in here .
1	3I	yeah , sure . that 's good .
1	3I	sticks of butter . that goes -
1	3I	eggs and sticks of trunc yeah , that 's dairy .
1	3I	yeah , we do n't really have milk anywhere else , so that 's fine .
1	3I	good idea .
1	3I	next - next to trunc
2	3I	oh , right next to the sugar .
1	3I	that makes trunc i think that makes sense
2	3I	this is , like , kind of our cold area .
0	3I	cans of peas .
1	3I	that would be down here , right ?
1	3I	yeah , that 's -
1	3I	hm just in case some of this comes in , i think i 'm gon na put it right trunc like , bout here ?
1	3I	yeah , these are trunc this is , like , fresh stuff over here .
3	3I	sharp objects . next to the small axes . yes !
3	3I	doing some good .
1	3I	mint toothpaste next to toilet paper ? that 's , like , toiletries .
1	3I	oh , do we want that next to the eggs or in , like , the random section ?
3	3I	next to refrigerator magnets !
0	3I	um -
1	3I	this is outdoorsy . but , this is , like , on the - this is , like , the outside stuff , and this is , like , the tools , or whatever . i do n't know .
0	3I	hm , hm .
1	3I	take your pick ! somewhere in here .
1	3I	sounds good .
1	3I	tweezers . that 's , like -
1	3I	toiletry tools like how bout next to toothpaste ?
1	3I	like that sounds like they kind of go together .
3	3I	um , how bout next to the packages of cookies , yes !
1	3I	five-pound weights ? ! we do n't have workout areas . maybe next to the toys ?
1	3I	you think trunc ?
2	3I	well , let 's look at this for a second .
1	3I	i would n't -
1	3I	they 're not really blunt weapons .
1	3I	or sharp weapons this is all kinda done .
2	3I	i think they 're more recreational , which is why i 'd put it up here . and this is more , like , i need to build my house .
1	3I	would you mind here ?
1	3I	okay .
0	3I	go ahead .
3	3I	what ? ! who sells that ?
0	3I	um .
2	3I	put it , like , near this stuff . maybe , like , put it here ? or here ?
2	3I	yeah . yeah , okay .
1	3I	yeah , you can cut them with scissors , cuz they 're trunc they 're little sticks . they 're not - trunc if it was bundles of wood , maybe use -
1	3I	pre-cut wood . maybe next to the saws and axes ?
1	3I	huh clothes .
0	3I	without looking , i got bagels .
1	3I	do we got bread stuff ?
1	3I	pouches of oatmeal .
1	3I	yeah , put it next to the pre-cut wood , maybe ?
1	3I	let 's see what we got .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
1	3I	that should be , like , right here , next to the box knives ?
1	3I	exactly .
0	3I	um .
2	3I	put it next to the large cups , cuz they are containers also .
0	3I	let 's see -
3	3I	heavy coats . next to the thick sweaters !
2	3I	oh , good , we 're done .
2	3I	next to ice cream , yeah .
2	3I	yeah uh , good thing , too .
2	3I	yeah . we only messed up a little bit cuz of the overpopulation here .
0	3I	uh , we 're done !
0	3I	if you 'd like to come in and rescue us again .
0	6B	have to cut the same number of items from each column
0	6B	no .
0	6B	we 're good , we 're good !
0	6B	got ta cut the same number of items . so -
2	6B	i think we 'll go through a list and be , like , this is how many useless things we found , and then we 'll cut that same number .
2	6B	but if it - trunc but trunc be - maybe if we agree that it 's too low then we 'll switch it up .
1	6B	so let 's just think about these things . math tutors , assistant cooks , sex ed , custodians , speech therapy , football equipment , acting coaches , poetry books , special ed teachers , cooking classes , notetakers , sugar-free juice machines -
0	6B	bookkeeping classes , and music teachers .
1	6B	i think we can - trunc any one that jump out at you ?
2	6B	yeah , i think so too . bring your own juice .
1	6B	and trunc i think bookkeeping classes .
2	6B	why would you need an education program for that ?
0	6B	um -
1	6B	how bout , uh , assistant cooks ?
2	6B	because you already have cooks , why do you need assistant cooks ? the cooks will just have to work a little harder , i 'm sorry .
1	6B	let 's keep trunc sex ed .
2	6B	let 's keep custodians ! they 're really important
0	6B	um .
2	6B	oh , cooking classes ? yeah , cut that . that 's not really necessary . we got the internet . learn on your trunc learn on your own .
2	6B	uh , special ed teachers we kinda need , because that - well - we 'll run into that . math is important .
2	6B	speech therapy is trunc um -
2	6B	so , the thing about speech therapy is , we would either - we would either need them - if we cut that , we 'd need the to do that on their own , which is kinda trunc of -
2	6B	kind of a burden .
2	6B	we could cut - trunc we trunc yeah , w-
1	6B	i guess -
2	6B	that 's - well , i mean , it 's just a program , it 's , like , an acting program . so we have , like , the music program , we got the math program . i might trunc we - maybe we keep the acting one , and we cut the poetry books .
2	6B	because we - s-
2	6B	get your own trunc !
2	6B	go to the library ! yeah , do that .
1	6B	so how bout we cut five from each of these ?
1	6B	okay . trunc so let 's just read all of them . trunc reproductive , job training , chicken pox , invasive species removal , s_t_d_ education , toxic waste disposal -
0	6B	hospital additions , bagel factory inspections , needle exchange , sex offender database -
0	6B	veterans medical assistance , egg farms regulations , weed control , pre-'natal checkups , neighborhood watch support .
1	6B	things that jump out at me -
0	6B	um -
2	6B	get rid of the needle exchange .
3	6B	uh - that is - i do n't know what that is , but it seems terrible .
2	6B	uh - let 's get rid of the neighborhood watch support .
1	6B	invasive species removal and i think weed control overlap , so - and i think weed control does less . and so i think we could get rid of trunc is that three ?
2	6B	and stupid .
2	6B	let 's get rid of that .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	i think we 're going to trunc have to keep toxic waste disposal . that seems important .
1	6B	vaccinations are important , job training is important , reproductive is important .
2	6B	that 's true . maybe if we cut the s_t_d_ education , we can just keep reproductive ?
2	6B	sure ! let 's do - let 's do that .
1	6B	i think pre-natal checkups is fine , i guess .
1	6B	yeah , sure , we 'll keep it in .
0	6B	okay . over to recreation public services . what we got ? we got stray cat spaying , public news station , food bank , junior soccer league , kitten puppy adoption , soup kitchens , housing assistance , dog catcher -
0	6B	boy 's basketball club , public access station , reusable bag campaign , veterinary hospital , football stadium upkeep and pest control !
1	6B	trunc i do n't know how badly this neighborhood needs a dog catcher .
2	6B	what ? where - where are we ? are we doing this for a county ? like , county-wide dog catcher ? i trunc i do n't see trunc dog catchers i think - i do n't think we have to worry about that .
1	6B	yeah , do n't think that 's a trunc i do n't think that 's a problem right now .
1	6B	so that 's two we can get rid of .
0	6B	um -
0	6B	hm .
1	6B	how bout public access station ?
3	6B	just cuz there 's not a lot of - football stadium upkeep ! let 's get rid of that .
2	6B	i do n't care about the football stadium .
2	6B	i think the public news station would be - we - we should probably keep one of these .
1	6B	uh , keep -
1	6B	i like soccer more than basketball .
3	6B	yeah , we do n't need basketball . that 's fine . we do n't win in the olympics anyways . the n_b_a_ 's a joke .
2	6B	okay , that 's five .
2	6B	teaching certificates speed limit signs , additional bus stops , tattoo artist licenses , that 's going away .
0	6B	pothole maintenance , subway system , hunting tags , towing services , massage certificates , flagpole repair , taxi stops -
0	6B	fishing licenses -
0	6B	public bus upkeep -
0	6B	drainage ditches .
2	6B	ooh , this is gon na be tough .
2	6B	we got the pot - tattoo artist licenses , we can get rid of that because you can look at the art on their wall or get recommendations or whatever . you do n't really need a license to do that .
2	6B	teaching certificate . i think you freaking need those .
2	6B	speed limit signs uh -
3	6B	i do n't know about those , actually . i do n't know .
0	6B	um , additional bus stops -
1	6B	i know how bad bussing is .
2	6B	but the subway system is , like , a centralized thing . i do n't know .
2	6B	subway system kinda goes , like - is the main trunc trunc thing , and then you take buses around , like , the outsides trunc and junk . i think you need both of those .
2	6B	all these things are pretty trunc important . oh , oh , oh oh , let 's get rid of that .
2	6B	massage certificates , get out .
2	6B	flagpole trunc get it - get out !
2	6B	repair your own freaking flag .
2	6B	yeah , get rid of that oh good , this is becoming easier .
1	6B	i think we need to keep drainage ditches .
1	6B	why do n't we just get rid of speed limit signs ? no one follows them anyway .
2	6B	you could get rid of towing services . we can keep it privatized .
1	6B	yeah , no one uses government towing services . that 's silly .
2	6B	alright , that 's five ! we 're good .
2	6B	you did n't even know what they were !
2	6B	we could 've cut the toxic waste disposal , you with no idea !
1	6B	let 's just build the worst -
1	6B	the worst community ever .
2	6B	oh yeah , that one was fun .
