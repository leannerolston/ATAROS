0	3I	yeah . we 're done !
0	6B	i 'm just looking here to see what - see - see what i can see on - on the list where i - where - where i - uh , that i figure -
1	6B	the list that i figure is the least important is the one i wan na get the number from .
2	6B	which is recreation and public services .
1	6B	i think .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	okay , so let 's cut four .
2	6B	well that 's - that 's - that 's a borderline . we 'll see what happens with the rest of it .
2	6B	that 's also borderline . see what happens with the rest of it .
1	6B	keep it .
1	6B	keep them .
1	6B	cut it .
1	6B	cut -
1	6B	cut it .
1	6B	the , uh , the alumni will pay for it .
1	6B	yes . drama coaches , yes .

1	6B	that 's what i 'm trunc yeah .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	just staying there for a while , yeah yeah .
1	6B	uh , yes , i believe i would . we got two gone already , do n't we ? huh .
1	6B	- trunc yeah , we keep them .
1	6B	keep them .
0	6B	huh .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	can them .
0	6B	oh .
1	6B	i do n't think so either .
2	6B	sugar-free juice machines , we can can those . we talked about that . yeah , let 's get rid of those because they do n't make any money .
0	6B	that 's not a pepsi machine .
2	6B	i think in today 's world , uh , with , uh , the number of kids that ca n't count -
2	6B	that are out there wandering around now - i had a bank teller who could n't count , by the way . about three weeks ago , yeah . i had to tell her - tell her she ca n't count .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	and that 's what they trunc that 's what they thought in the - think in the bank , too , but when they 're sitting there and they actually counting money in front of you -
2	6B	you know , that 's when it gets - that 's when it gets tense .
0	6B	hm .
1	6B	yeah , okay .
0	6B	speech therapy 's gone , football equipment 's gone -
0	6B	uh , the cooking classes are gone .

1	6B	okay .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	reproductive education , job training programs , chicken pox vaccinations , -
2	6B	i do n't think we can remove any of those , actually . reproductive education i 'd put on the line , because it 's - it 's - it 's - it 's not necessary -
2	6B	to , uh -
2	6B	immediate -
2	6B	trunc uh - uh - the trunc the immediate lack of - a lack of that wo n't affect the public health .
0	6B	huh .
2	6B	yeah , that 's it . uh , yeah . but i think it 's uh , you know , basically it 's - it 's one of those things where if we do n't have it it 's not going to really affect the public health and safety immediately .
0	6B	um -
0	6B	oh .
1	6B	yeah . that 's just a - on the list . no , nothing else .
2	6B	okay , we 'd trunc probably have to - if we have to make cuts and they 're spending too much money , uh , trunc bagel factory inspections .
2	6B	what do we need bagel factory inspections for ?
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	well , trunc no , just bagel factories , it 's obviously what it says , so that must be what it is .
2	6B	so can that !
2	6B	i know . well yeah , yeah , well , the thing is - the thing is , is when you - when you make a bagel , what are you making , you know ? cooked bread .
2	6B	how you gon na screw that up ?
2	6B	course , you could do what mcdonald 's did . mcdonald 's got caught putting too much wood pulp in their hamburger buns in iowa .
0	6B	yeah , was about twenty years ago .
2	6B	yeah , i ca n't cut that .
1	6B	nope .
2	6B	veterans medical assistance is - uh , the united states government does that , so cut that . that not a county deal !
0	6B	huh .
0	6B	uh , the other one was , uh , reproductive education .
0	6B	hm .
2	6B	neighborhood watch support can go . now we got ta find one more . one more , we got ta go .

1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	job training programs !
2	6B	yeah . i - i - i - - yeah , the thing is we need to have them , because we got too many - too many kids that do n't have any skills .
0	6B	uh -
2	6B	well right now we 've got , uh , let me see , there 's a , uh - there 's a , uh - uh a bug that is going around removing all deciduous trees in the united states .
2	6B	would you want them to not do that and lose all of the trees in washington .
1	6B	yeah .

0	6B	okay .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	teacher certificates , i am absolutely - in fact , i 'm , uh , i 'm - i 'm all for , uh - for making sure that , uh -

2	6B	hoo . yeah , well it should n't be ever done . uh -
2	6B	course , you know , that comes right down - that comes right down to the root thing , is , you know , why do we spend so much money on certain things and not enough money on things that really matter , like education
