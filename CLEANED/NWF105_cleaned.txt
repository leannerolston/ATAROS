1	3I	maybe somewhere -
1	3I	oh , i do n't know . i was gon na say by the refrigerator magnet , and random -

2	3I	so far that does n't seem to match any -
2	3I	categories that we have .
1	3I	yeah , that 's true .
1	3I	sure ! it 'll be our catchall .
2	3I	i say that goes by refrigerator magnets , too . that 's the random stuff .
1	3I	sure yeah .
1	3I	or - ooh , we already put it . i was gon na say by backpacks and books it coulda been good too , but that 's fine .
2	3I	somewhere in that first aisle , i would say .

2	3I	somewhere over in that first aisle , yeah .
2	3I	sure !
2	3I	maybe it 's - maybe it 's fishing books . eh , just put it next to the books .

1	3I	over here , too ?
2	3I	or is that more over here ?
2	3I	let 's put it over here .

2	3I	feel like our pet food 's kinda -
2	3I	outta place , there .
0	3I	okay .
1	3I	no .
2	3I	i do n't think we 're very good at organizing stores based on one item at a time , but that 's okay .
1	6B	well , should we start with education programs ?
0	6B	alright .
0	6B	math tutors .
1	6B	i do too .
0	6B	assistant cooks .
1	6B	they 're all gon na trunc be important .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	okay , so assistant cooks is a possibility to cut , right ?
1	6B	sex ed seems pretty important to me custodians are pretty important .
2	6B	speech therapy , i 'm biased , i think it 's really important .
0	6B	football equipment .
1	6B	yeah . that 's something that -
1	6B	could be fundraised for .
2	6B	okay , so potentially two .
0	6B	acting coaches .
1	6B	i would kinda cut it , but -
1	6B	okay .
0	6B	poetry books .
1	6B	it is for sure let 's see .
1	6B	yep .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	cooking classes could be cut .
2	6B	can learn how to do that at home .
0	6B	sugar-free juice machines .
2	6B	that could be cut , too , theoretically , if -
1	6B	do you think it 's important ?
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	i agree .
1	6B	i agree .
1	6B	i think music is important , for sure .
1	6B	so , which ones do you wan na cut for sure ?
2	6B	i think we 're really in agreement about football equipment .
1	6B	acting coaches ?
1	6B	agree .
1	6B	yeah , assistant cooks .
1	6B	cooking classes ?
1	6B	do you agree ?
1	6B	do those seem -
0	6B	it 's four .
1	6B	should we ?
0	6B	five .
1	6B	think we 're -
1	6B	yes , we are . alright ! five . public health and safety .
0	6B	reproductive education .
0	6B	i think so .
0	6B	maybe it 's -
1	6B	i do n't know .
1	6B	well i guess theoretically if we already have it , we could cut it , right ?
1	6B	i do n't know .
1	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	i - well , i did n't get a chicken pox vaccination . i think a lot of kids just naturally get chicken pox and then they 're fine .
1	6B	trunc trunc do n't they ?
1	6B	i think ! i mean - mm-hm .
0	6B	oh really ? did you have the vaccination ?
0	6B	really ?
2	6B	yeah , i think that 's really . mm-hm . that 's what i 've heard .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	i trunc i do n't think so , i - i think you -
1	6B	trunc most people just get it when they 're a kid , and then -
1	6B	i could be wrong , though .
1	6B	so potentially we could cut that one . let 's keep going , but -
0	6B	invasive species removal .
1	6B	i do n't know .
1	6B	it 's important , but i 'm not sure if it 's on the top of the list .
2	6B	potentially . kay . s_t_d_ education . pretty important .
1	6B	that 's true .
1	6B	and reproductive education .
2	6B	well , we could theoretically cut one or the other of those and makes the other one take over .
2	6B	kay , toxic waste disposal , that 's really important .
1	6B	do you wan na read them ? just for -
1	6B	important , i think .
0	6B	i do n't know what that means .
0	6B	do you ?
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	well let 's keep it for now , in case it 's important .
0	6B	sex offender database .
1	6B	i do too .
0	6B	veterans -
1	6B	i do too .
1	6B	i think so . yeah , i think that 's less important . i -
2	6B	pre-natal checkups , very important . neighborhood watch support , that 's -
2	6B	that 's pretty important . so if we were to get rid of four -
2	6B	i think chicken pox .
1	6B	invasive species ?
1	6B	one of the educations . either reproductive or s_t_d_ , do you agree ?
1	6B	okay .
0	6B	oh really ?
2	6B	ok. well , i wonder if reproductive has to do with -
1	6B	like , even -
1	6B	childbirth , and -
1	6B	caring for children .
1	6B	like , you know -
1	6B	pre-natal care .
1	6B	well , weed control trunc we can take out .
0	6B	so -
1	6B	that 's three . we need one more .
1	6B	sure , since we do n't know what it is .
1	6B	okay , recreation and public services . go ahead , you can read them .
1	6B	that 's a good thing . i do n't know .
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	that 's pretty important .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah that is true .
1	6B	i know a lot of churches run food banks , too .
1	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	oh , i like the idea , but that is something that could be cut .
1	6B	i do n't know .
2	6B	as far as the level importance , it seems less important than soup kitchens to me .
1	6B	stays ? yeah . housing assistance , think stays .
0	6B	dog catcher -
1	6B	i do n't know .
0	6B	i think that 's th-
0	6B	they take pets to the pound .
0	6B	if they 're out running around .
1	6B	i do n't know if that 's important or not . i 've never really been exposed that much that .
1	6B	so .
1	6B	potentially we could trunc cut it .
0	6B	boy 's basketball club
2	6B	i 'd rather keep the soccer league , cuz it sounds like it 's for everyone .
1	6B	than the basketball club .
0	6B	public access station ?
0	6B	what does that mean ?
0	6B	kay .
0	6B	okay .
0	6B	okay .
0	6B	yeah , i have .
0	6B	veterinary
1	6B	that 's important , but it also does n't seem like it 'd be trunc funded by the community .
1	6B	by the county , rather .
0	6B	football stadium upkeep and pest control okay .
1	6B	so if we 're to cut four -
0	6B	we kinda said -
1	6B	kitten and puppy adoption .
1	6B	right ?
1	6B	dog catcher .
1	6B	do we agree ?
0	6B	um -
1	6B	boy 's basketball club .
0	6B	and -
1	6B	sure . we 'll - we 'll let a private one take over .
0	6B	okay .
0	6B	go for it .
1	6B	i agree .
1	6B	i agree .
1	6B	that 's helpful .
1	6B	yeah , that 's true .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	uh-huh .
1	6B	okay .
0	6B	i do n't know if -
0	6B	i do n't know much about that .
2	6B	um - but it 's not very important to me , personally , so -
1	6B	maybe .
1	6B	so , trunc potentially trunc additional bus stops and tattoo artist licenses .
1	6B	i agree .
1	6B	yeah . i think that 's pretty important .
1	6B	i think that 's important to be funding .
1	6B	i would also say that 's important for control .
1	6B	people do n't hunt too much .
1	6B	sure .
1	6B	i would say also not as important .
1	6B	i do n't know .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	i do n't know . let 's cut that one .
1	6B	let 's keep it . keep the last three .
0	6B	trunc so -
1	6B	the ones we we 're were additional bus stops , tattoo artist licenses -
1	6B	towing services , trunc trunc massage certificates , and taxi stops , so we can keep one of those . which one do we wan na keep ?
1	6B	should we keep that one ?
1	6B	sounds good .
0	6B	alright .
