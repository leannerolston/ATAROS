1	3I	so if you - why do n't you just , like , pull one out and then we can talk about it .
1	3I	maybe we could do multiple .
0	3I	alright . boxes of doughnuts .

1	3I	either near the baking things or near sorta the trunc like -
0	3I	processed food .
0	3I	books , scissors . i have socks .
1	3I	um , i think that -

0	3I	yeah .
1	3I	sure . yeah , that looks great .
0	3I	and then socks . um .
0	3I	socks .
1	3I	we can make , like , a clothing kind of spot .
1	3I	okay . i 'm gon na put it right here .
1	3I	okay . cool . and then , for boxes of doughnuts , um -
2	3I	or maybe next to - yeah , we can do that .

0	3I	for deck chairs .
0	3I	oh .
2	3I	yeah . sure .

1	3I	okay . cool .
2	3I	yes .
1	3I	sure ! yeah , that 's a good spot .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	liters of water . i would -

1	3I	so , i do n't know . yeah .
1	3I	maybe here ? is that okay ?
2	3I	shoot . there 's , like , awkward spacing here .
0	3I	um .
2	3I	okay ! yeah . let 's do that .
1	3I	oh that should go with scissors and - yeah . cool .
1	3I	yeah , go over here .
1	3I	put it by the -
2	3I	ice cream . no . i do n't know . um , we can -
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	we could hold off on the cases of whiskey , maybe , and see what else comes up .
2	3I	gas-powered cookstoves would definitely go in this area .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	sure !
1	3I	soy beans .
1	3I	over there . no , they 're not just vests , they are large .
2	3I	oh really ? that 's funny . yeah , we can put that there .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	should hats go here ?
1	3I	in this area ?
2	3I	uh-oh , we 're encroaching on the cans of stuff . mint toothpaste and beets . toothpaste .
0	3I	um .

1	3I	i 'm gon na put heavy cable over here .
1	3I	yeah , we should do that .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	good thinking .
1	3I	looks - sure . yeah .
1	3I	these could go near each other .
1	3I	that 's kind of like a instant food .
1	3I	right .
1	3I	around this pre-cut wood ?
0	3I	bundles of sticks , cool .
0	3I	um .
2	3I	ooh . that should go in this - this is sweets area .
2	3I	um . oh , but this is sweets , too . oh , that 's baking though . important distinction .
1	3I	right .
1	3I	this area ?
1	3I	here .
1	3I	this area .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	bottles of juice . i think that could go down here .
1	3I	i would put it here .
1	3I	tweezers should go here , i think .
0	3I	peat trunc
1	3I	is it okay if i put it here ?
1	3I	okay .
2	3I	yeah , anything - i guess i 'll try to group together things that you could use outside , or like , if you 're doing utility type things , but -
1	3I	we could have a , um , we could have - trunc
1	3I	okay . sure .
2	3I	sticks of butter , trunc oh , sticks of butter . do you agree it should go near cake mix and sugar ? okay , cool .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	could go right - er .
1	3I	what were you thinking ?
2	3I	okay .
2	3I	yeah .
1	3I	that 's a good idea .
1	3I	box knives . bars of soap . that can go - is this okay ? cool .
2	3I	that 's very specific . yeah , perfect ! we - it 's a good thing we left that open . i 'm gon na put this next to small axes . maybe . eh ?
1	3I	yeah .
2	3I	yeah !
1	3I	either . either spot i think is probably fine .
2	3I	yeah ! perfect .
1	3I	just trunc stick it up there , maybe .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	pet food .
2	3I	or - or next to toys , i mean , kinda just more miscellaneous items .
0	3I	um .
2	3I	i do n't know . or we can hold off on it , mm .
2	3I	sure .
1	3I	yeah . that would - i think that makes sense .
1	3I	buckets could go here .
1	3I	or near the peat moss .
1	3I	near the - we put the peat moss ?
2	3I	oh , perfect .
1	3I	this area ?
1	3I	yes .
0	3I	um .
1	3I	let 's do -
1	3I	we can - hm .
1	3I	we can put bagels -
1	3I	here .
1	3I	maybe ? yeah .
1	3I	and then i will put -
1	3I	beets here .
0	3I	and then -
1	3I	cases of whiskey can go here .
2	3I	yes , perfect .
1	3I	cool !
2	3I	well there were a lot of unrelated things that could n't really be grouped together .
1	3I	yes . we do .
1	3I	yeah , it 's okay . alright , i think - you think we 're done ?
0	3I	okay .
0	3I	sweet .
2	3I	it 's so quiet in here .
2	3I	it 's creepy , it 's very creepy . cuz i live on a busy street , so i 'm used to -
2	6B	this is how i propose we go about it . so -
3	6B	we can look at something , and say , like , definitely not cut , definitely do cut , or unsure . and then i can keep track just , like , on my hands how many things we say we definitely should cut . and then - i do n't know . if you have any other ideas . but that 's just what i thought might be a good idea . and then we could maybe revisit them .
1	6B	sure .
2	6B	i do n't think those should be cut .
2	6B	i know . i think assistant cooks can be cut . trunc in my opinion .
2	6B	i do n't know , that 's why it can be cut !
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	i think that 's a good idea .
1	6B	yes .
1	6B	portant ?
0	6B	kay . football equipment .
2	6B	i 'd be down for that . football gets too much funding .
1	6B	i think we could -
1	6B	cut -
2	6B	right right right . they do n't - trunc they can - they do n't need to be thespians . alright .
1	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	right .
1	6B	i think that 's important . yeah .
2	6B	right right right . that 's why we can cut the assistant cooks .
1	6B	yeah , we should keep that .
1	6B	trunc yes . yeah trunc yeah .
0	6B	bookkeeping classes .
2	6B	trunc i think those are important .
2	6B	yes . i agree . okay , so we cut four . so , let 's cut four from everything else .
2	6B	okay . i do n't think reproductive education should be cut .
2	6B	or nor job training programs .
1	6B	this is gon na be the hard one .
2	6B	chicken pox vaccinations are pretty important .
0	6B	um .
2	6B	s_t_d_ education should probably not be cut .
2	6B	in trunc in relation to the other things , it can probably be cut .
2	6B	as can weed control .
0	6B	that 's a little further down . yeah . those -
2	6B	i 'm not really sure what that means . oh , like adding on to the hospital . mm .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	i think -
3	6B	my opinion is to cut sex offender database and neighborhood watch support . that 's - but -
2	6B	just just by process of elimination .
0	6B	the other two were trunc the invasive species removal and weed control .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	so . do you agree with that ?
2	6B	maybe , um -
1	6B	right right right .
2	6B	yeah , we could cut hospital additions instead of the sex offender database . okay !
1	6B	sure .
1	6B	trunc er , invasive species -
1	6B	sweet ! okay .
0	6B	recreation and public services .
0	6B	stray cat spaying .
2	6B	i think that 's important . um , to keep -
1	6B	the homeless animal population down .
1	6B	yeah , make sure .
1	6B	mm-hm !
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	we 'll think about it .
2	6B	oh ! yeah .
1	6B	yes . i agree .
1	6B	yes .
1	6B	yeah , i think it is .
1	6B	boy 's basketball club . maybe we can -
1	6B	cut that and keep the soccer league ?
2	6B	i do n't know . mm .
1	6B	right .
2	6B	i dunno , these ones are kind of hard to pick because a lot of these are important in my opinion .
1	6B	no .
1	6B	right .
1	6B	right .
0	6B	i do n't know what that means .
2	6B	well i think that we should choose between public news station and public access station . i do n't think we need both .
1	6B	sure .
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	yeah . stick with that trend .
1	6B	no .
1	6B	trunc
0	6B	so that means we would be cutting dog catcher , boy 's basketball club , football stadium upkeep , and the public access station .
1	6B	are you okay with those four ?
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	sure . maybe , um -
1	6B	instead of the boy 's basketball club ?
1	6B	or -
2	6B	okay , so then we 'd have both the public access station and public news station . that 's fine .
2	6B	yeah ! okay , cool .
0	6B	um dog catcher ?
2	6B	okay . yeah , we can cut one of the animal things . there 's like trunc four of them . okay , infrastructure and licensing . definitely cut speed limit signs . no , i 'm just kidding ! probably not a good idea . um -
2	6B	alright , so teaching certificates we should keep .
1	6B	speed limit signs , we should keep .
1	6B	i think -
1	6B	additional bus stops , we should keep .
2	6B	because i think we can get rid of some of these licenses .
1	6B	like tattoo artist license .
2	6B	you want them to be licensed . that 's a good point , actually .
1	6B	that 's a good point .
2	6B	ah . dang . okay .
2	6B	we 'll think about it . man , trunc that 's important . i do n't think we should cut that .
1	6B	i know .
1	6B	i personally think those could get cut .
1	6B	uh-huh .
2	6B	yeah , yeah . sure , sure sure sure .
3	6B	that can be cut ! screw that ! cuz - cuz if we 're not cutting subway system or bus , then we can cut taxi .
0	6B	i think we trunc we 're at three , cuz we 're cutting -
0	6B	trunc oh .
0	6B	hunting tags -
0	6B	and taxi stops . so , these four .
1	6B	cool . so we 're keeping fishing licenses , public bus upkeep , drainage ditches . okay , cool ! so , we 're done .
1	6B	that was n't too bad .
0	6B	now i know why a lot of people -
2	6B	why it 's hard - it 's hard to pick things to cut . but then you can look at like , politicians , you think they 're jerks cuz it 's , like , how can you cut something for animals ? and it 's , like , well compared to something else - right .
0	6B	however , many people are usually making a decision , yeah .
1	6B	right .
1	6B	do n't have to try to get people to vote for us or anything .
