0	3I	duct tape and - 
1	3I	i think that 's good . 
0	3I	scissors . 
2	3I	maybe that could also be with like , school supplies . may like , refrigerator trunc well toys kind of , are usually near the -

1	3I	great . 
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs . 
1	3I	pet food and large cups ? 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	true yeah . 
2	3I	yeah , we need to fill up some of that space . we only have - 
1	3I	four more . yeah . 
0	3I	okay . and then , socks . 
2	3I	easy . 
0	3I	bars of soap . 
1	3I	yeah . cake mix and - 
2	3I	breakfast stuff ? really ? the doughnuts cans of peas . 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	yeah . it's great . 
0	3I	we 're done . 
2	3I	i think we did a great job . i 'd shop here . 
0	6B	okay . 
1	6B	yeah , we could . it - 
0	6B	so . 
0	6B	mm-hm . 
0	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	at trunc start with two . two from each , yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . yeah . 
0	6B	so then math tutors . 
1	6B	alright , we 'll keep speech therapy . 
2	6B	and you got ta have custodians . sex ed's really important . 
0	6B	i don't even understand what - is this like a program where they train assistant cooks ? 
2	6B	football equipment - are they  buying football equipment for kids ? cuz we don't need that . 
2	6B	yeah . make em pay for it on their own . 
1	6B	mm-hm . 
2	6B	well , it's all about whether or not you appreciate the arts . 
2	6B	so . 
2	6B	got ta keep the acting . 
2	6B	got ta keep poetry . got ta keep the arts . 
1	6B	yes . 
1	6B	yes . i think so . 
0	6B	note-takers . 
0	6B	sugar free juice machines . 
2	6B	it's trunc portant , but i don't understand why the government's paying for it . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	 you sound like you are very opposed to sugar-free juices . 
1	6B	it's true . 
1	6B	yes . that 's important . and music teachers are important . 
2	6B	these are all important things cept for football equipment . 
1	6B	okay . 
1	6B	yeah . i don't really care . i wouldn't ever use it myself , so - 
1	6B	yes . 
1	6B	we 'll start with those two . 
2	6B	that 's what i 'm assuming . yeah . they don't need new equipment every year . 
1	6B	that 's silly . um . okay , moving on . 
0	6B	public health . 
2	6B	yes . 
2	6B	why is that not in education and programs ? 
1	6B	and so okay . yeah . okay . 
1	6B	definitely . 
2	6B	oh , wait a minute . 
2	6B	i don't know . i never got a vaccination . 
1	6B	they do now ? so kids never have chicken pox anymore ? they 're missing out on an important part of childhood . 
2	6B	 i 'd say we get rid of that one , let them have chicken pox for awhile . 
2	6B	sit at home in a oatmeal bath . 
1	6B	okay . 
0	6B	invasive species removal . 
1	6B	i think so . 
0	6B	s_t_d_ education . 
2	6B	didn't we have that ? 
2	6B	i mean sex ed . 
2	6B	it should be part of sex ed . 
0	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	yeah , there 's a lot of overlap here . 
2	6B	what is it - sex ed and reproductive education ? same thing . 
2	6B	trunc oh . reproductive education is probably for moms . expecting mothers . 
1	6B	mm-hm . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	i wonder if s_t_d_ education is redundant then . 
1	6B	probably . 
1	6B	mm-hm . 
1	6B	sure . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	what does that mean ? 
1	6B	mm . maybe . i dunno if we need that . 
0	6B	yeah ? 
1	6B	okay . 
1	6B	it depends , yeah . 
1	6B	yes . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	trunc trunc yes . yes . 
1	6B	weed control ? no . 
2	6B	yeah . well - invasive species removal should do enough . yeah . 
2	6B	should be in reproductive education . 
0	6B	yeah . hm . 
1	6B	i guess we hafta keep all of it , don't we ? just to be safe . 
1	6B	okay . 
2	6B	that i would say get away . give away . we don't need it . 
1	6B	right . 
1	6B	we already - we 're gonna take out - 
1	6B	chicken pox ? 
0	6B	oh , yeah . 
1	6B	right . 
2	6B	that 's redundant . 
2	6B	either neighborhood watch support or chicken pox . 
2	6B	oh , yeah , weed control . that 's right . yeah , that one . 
1	6B	sorry , yeah . weed control . yeah . weed control and s_t_d_ education . 
0	6B	done . 
0	6B	stray cat spaying ? 
1	6B	no . 
1	6B	dogs - 
1	6B	i think so , but cats ? i don't mind having cats run around on the streets . they 're fun . 
1	6B	uh , no ? 
1	6B	yeah , no , we don't need that . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	definitely need a food bank . 
1	6B	um . probably ? 
1	6B	that 's probably a pretty cheap one . football equipment's not cheap , but junior soccer league should be . 
0	6B	kitten and puppy adoption ? 
2	6B	yeah , then you get adopted , yeah . keep that one . 
1	6B	soup kitchens ? yes . 
1	6B	yes . 
2	6B	yeah . got ta bring em in to the kitty and trunc 
1	6B	and then - basketball ? do we want that as well as soccer ? 
2	6B	i think this one is not fair . boys basketball club ? what about the girls ? girls can play soccer too . 
2	6B	i say we cut it , just to be - 
2	6B	gender neutral . yeah . 
0	6B	like , uh , public television . 
0	6B	um . 
0	6B	i don't know . 
1	6B	i don't know . let's see what else we can cut . 
1	6B	we need the - wait - veterinary hospital ? 
1	6B	probably , yeah . 
0	6B	mm . 
1	6B	i dunno , we already cut the equipment . might as well just cut all of that sport . no . let's keep that one . 
0	6B	pest control . 
1	6B	probably need that , as well . 
1	6B	so we could cut - 
1	6B	yeah . boys basketball . and either stray cat spaying or community news ads ? 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	i don't either . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	cool . 
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing . 
1	6B	sure . 
2	6B	no , we can get rid of em keep that . 
1	6B	yeah . i don't know what that means , additional bus stops . are we increasing the budget if we keep that ? 
2	6B	that 's silly . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	in - in our trunc in our fictional town , i think it runs great . but we could use additional - 
2	6B	i don't think that 's necessary . 
2	6B	mm-mm . 
2	6B	trunc well , except that 's - what that is is regulating tattoo industry . we don't want anyone on the street - 
2	6B	puncturing holes in you , so - 
2	6B	this could - yeah . for public health concerns , we probably should keep it . 
0	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	boating licenses , probably should keep that too . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	we can cut the whole subway system - 
2	6B	with one stroke ? that 's amazing . 
1	6B	let's not do that . yeah , let's just keep it . 
0	6B	mm . 
1	6B	probably . i dunno - 
0	6B	how much hunting - well , it's like when you go out and you kill something , if you have tags , you have a permit to kill that one animal , or five of those animals . 
1	6B	so if you got rid of that - 
0	6B	right . but , how much hunting can you do in a place where there 's also subway system ? i don't understand where we are right now . 
1	6B	must like hunting - 
1	6B	squirrels or something . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	no ? 
1	6B	private sector can do that , just fine . 
1	6B	kay . 
1	6B	don't - 
1	6B	need it . 
1	6B	i don't know why we would have to certify masseuses 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	well , otherwise , it could be chaos , with taxis stopping everywhere . if you have stops , it could help a little bit . 
2	6B	and if they were there already , then it might just be really confusing if you get rid of them all of a sudden . 
0	6B	mm-hm . 
1	6B	they 've already been there . yeah . keep it around . i dunno . 
1	6B	mm-hm . 
1	6B	yes . 
1	6B	yes . 
0	6B	mm-hm . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . i think that 's good , though , because if we hafta cut the same from every category - 
2	6B	it's really hard to cut something from public health and safety . 
2	6B	the two that we cut were the only two we could do . 
1	6B	or we could do three . we could do the chicken pox , maybe . 
0	6B	did we ? 
2	6B	oh , it was education and programs .  that one was hard to cut any more than two . 
2	6B	unless we cut - 
1	6B	yeah . if we cut acting coaches . which is fine with me . cut the acting coaches . and then - 
2	6B	and then we 'd have three from each category . we could do that . 
1	6B	how much do you wanna cut ? 
0	6B	just two from each ? 
1	6B	mm-kay . 
1	6B	then we 're good . 
0	6B	we 're done . 
1	6B	i think so . 
1	6B	i really wish i knew what kind of a town this is .
