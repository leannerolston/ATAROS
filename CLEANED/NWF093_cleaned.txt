1	3I	yeah , maybe we wanna analyze for a sec , yeah . i guess i noticed that - 
2	3I	so yeah , definitely food over here . that looks like the chilled items side . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	right , right . um , and then - yeah , baked goods but nothing refrigerated here . 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	true . dried figs , though . um , maybe near soybeans ? 
1	3I	in that sort of area although i guess we have - so , i guess we would populate both sides of that , so we would still have that side all empty . 
1	3I	i don't know . um - 
1	3I	that 's a good - 
1	3I	that 's a good one , yeah . 
1	3I	i like that idea . 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	yes . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	okay . do you wanna try some ? should i , like - ? guess i 'll grab a handful . 
0	3I	um . trying to be quiet with them . alright . 
0	3I	so , i have toilet paper , heavy cable , and books of matches . 
0	3I	what do you have ? 
0	3I	okay um so we said - 
2	3I	no , we didn't ! um . 
2	3I	yeah , i was wondering that too . i bet if we crammed the hardware store things there , we could . 
1	3I	yeah or maybe this is just kind of a wrap around , like , there wasn't enough room on that side and - i don't know . okay , yeah . go ahead and put - 
1	3I	yeah . 
0	3I	um - 
1	3I	heavy cable . i 'll put that uh - 
0	3I	cable - 
0	3I	cable ? is that - 
1	3I	would that be better with power cords or siding ? 
1	3I	which do you think ? 
1	3I	okay . 
0	3I	um , where 'd we say uh , toiletries ? 
1	3I	over here ? okay . 
0	3I	um . 
2	3I	i 'm gonna - 
2	3I	put it here so we can work up , cuz i forget if - how many random things we have . tha- 
2	3I	yes , definitely . 
1	3I	maybe above ? cuz i trunc i - i don't know . yeah . books of matches . 
1	3I	would you say home depot stuff , or kitchen-y stuff ? 
1	3I	okay . 
1	3I	that works . 
0	3I	they had office things sorta around where - 
2	3I	oh yeah ! yeah yeah , yeah that sounds good . 
1	3I	maybe across from the toys , sort of ? well , cuz they had - 
2	3I	yeah , they sort of grouped toys and travel guides and books and stuff together and that - that seemed to work for me , when i read it . okay . 
0	3I	there you go . 
0	3I	doughnuts , tow ropes , and cushions for deck chairs . box knives . chocolate bars , tweezers , and - 
1	3I	near the toilet paper . 
0	3I	was there anything um - 
2	3I	like , within - okay , yeah , cuz i was gonna say , if there were toiletries that were more - 
2	3I	that would go better with toilet - yeah toilet paper , yeah . i think so , yeah . 
1	3I	um , i don't know , i 'm trunc i trunc don't really remember - 
1	3I	okay . okay . um tow ropes i guess i would put with heavy cable , right ? 
1	3I	and - or - 
1	3I	boating supplies . i guess tow - well - 
1	3I	are tow ropes for - ? okay . 
1	3I	boxes of doughnuts . i would say probably - 
2	3I	yeah . well , we do have cake mix and sugar here but those are not ready-to-eat . 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	okay , yeah . 
2	3I	i 'm gonna put it - 
2	3I	trunc yeah , trunc somewhere - i was thinking somewhere around here , cuz then it's , like , you could wrap around from the sugar if you 're feeling sugary . but yeah , ice cream . 
1	3I	yeah , the flow of traffic . 
2	3I	um . we should . yeah . um . 
2	3I	i 'm trying to think what else - there were some sort of electrical-y things that could go more around the power cords . trunc weren't there a couple electric type things ? 
0	3I	i think . 
1	3I	yeah , okay so , probably leave at least a space for trunc i don't know , maybe on this side , then ? i 'm trunc not trunc i 'm not really sure . 
2	3I	okay ! um , cushions for deck chairs . 
2	3I	i - somewhere up here , for sure . 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	yeah ! 
0	3I	okay . 
2	3I	yeah ! yeah yeah . kind of surprise them . i read some - or , heard some interesting things about trunc the flow of traffic in - in grocery stores . people will always tend to , like - trunc i forget if it was - 
0	3I	clockwise or counter-clockwise , i 'm trying to picture what i would do , cuz it - 
0	3I	i was - it , like , worked for me . i don't know , people , like always move in a certain direction , um and i think it has something to do with , like , the , uh , way you drive in that country , what side you drive on - people are , like , used to moving in a certain direction . yeah , so they 'll arrange things , like , get the - the - i don't know maybe towards - 
0	3I	i don't know , towards one end or the other , they 'll put things that are more impulse buys , because , trunc people are more likely to impulse buy like , at the beginning or end . i - i don't remember the details . 
0	3I	okay . um . 
1	3I	well , i guess coats - we have hats , where are hats ? 
1	3I	oh . yeah , okay , so coats could go up there . sure . 
2	3I	uh , i 'm gonna put my dried figs next to the soybeans . 
0	3I	oh yeah . 
1	3I	i 'd say - 
1	3I	trunc oh , gosh , it's such a big decision ! i don't know ! um - uh , i - yeah , i don't really know . go for it . okay . 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	would think maybe in this quadrant here ? okay . 
2	3I	yes , yes . 
1	3I	yeah , that works . um i have buckets and cups . 
1	3I	yeah ? 
2	3I	trunc trunc i don't know about trunc cups i can see that . 
2	3I	but it trunc i mean , it could trunc i guess flow from kitchen-y , then to cups , then to buckets . 
2	3I	but buckets , depends - i mean , buckets , you use a lot outside . 
1	3I	true . 
1	3I	okay . 
1	3I	and we also have , like - don't we have , like , water jugs and things like that that trunc 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	i 'm - i 'm thinking maybe above . 
1	3I	cuz , trunc okay . 
1	3I	i feel like this is more , like - getting more and more sort of - 
1	3I	i don't know . 
1	3I	small and delicate box knives . 
0	3I	uh . 
2	3I	i don't think we 're gonna have enough clothing to fills all this . you could use some of this space . yeah yeah , all the good dangerous things . 
1	3I	that 's a good point , too . 
1	3I	yeah , go for it . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	that would make sense . um . 
2	3I	yeah , cuz what else were we gonna put on that side ? just lots of the food items ? we don't have  all that much food . 
2	3I	yeah , i can put it here , and then the front to the store's here , so they can't - they can't run out . there we go . alright . 
0	3I	okay . 
2	3I	i 'm gonna put my butter next to the eggs here ? 
1	3I	unless y- 
1	3I	totally . 
1	3I	okay . sticks , i 'll put that with wood i guess . 
0	3I	small saws . 
1	3I	i 'll put it here , with the box knives . 
0	3I	um trunc trunc are those , like , exercise weights ? is that what they mean ? 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	sure . yeah yeah . 
2	3I	yeah . and i 'd say scissors , i 'm gonna put that above the paper . 
1	3I	and bags of peat moss , probably with - 
1	3I	sticks ? yeah , yeah . 
1	3I	garden-y type stuff . 
1	3I	okay . 
0	3I	let's see . 
2	3I	yes , totally . 
1	3I	um , cans of peas . soybeans . 
2	3I	um , oh , small axes , nice ! this is interesting , cuz we have these separate - i - i mean , i guess small saws maybe would 've - 
2	3I	trunc were we gonna keep sharps here ? even though this is kind of a - i mean , it could totally work with wood and outdoor stuff , too . 
1	3I	yeah . if - yeah . 
0	3I	um fishing net . 
1	3I	boating supplies . 
0	3I	fleece-lined boots . did we have any other - 
1	3I	um , clothing items that were , like on the top ? 
2	3I	okay . cuz i was trunc so boots and socks , those would go all together . i 'm wondering whether we need - whether we want any more space here for - 
0	3I	did they have , like , gloves or shirts ? 
0	3I	okay . 
1	3I	i 'll put it there . 
1	3I	just in case there 's - i forget if we have shirts or not . yeah . 
1	3I	where do you think water should go ? 
2	3I	i like it , yeah . what else ? 
1	3I	well , it can be - 
2	3I	i - uh , well i 'd say tools , yeah . 
1	3I	sure . yeah . 
0	3I	wetsuits . um here's some . 
1	3I	fishing net or , yeah . 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	it's kinda random . 
1	3I	yeah , under boating supplies . 
2	3I	i 'm gonna put my shoelaces - 
0	3I	let's see . 
1	3I	do you think i should put it here or here ? sorry , what ? 
0	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	okay . 
0	3I	what was that , oatmeal ? 
1	3I	yeah probably by cake mix . 
1	3I	like , cuz you have to do - you have to  make it , right ? 
1	3I	um , maybe below . 
2	3I	or - but trunc i don't know what's trunc what we 're gonna put above , but - 
1	3I	yeah , okay . 
1	3I	dried figs ? or , does trunc those don't have to be refrigerated , no , they 're - 
1	3I	just fresh . 
0	3I	um . 
0	3I	i trunc we don't really have any other fresh - yeah . i guess with - 
1	3I	the trunc i mean , the figs and the beans and the peas , that 's - 
1	3I	like produce . 
2	3I	um , light jackets , aha ! i  knew i saved a space for something ! and - 
1	3I	maybe in the school-y type area ? 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	i guess i 'll - could put it below . i don't really know if that 's a space up there , anyway . 
0	3I	okay . 
0	3I	gas-powered cookstoves . 
1	3I	i mean , definitely over here , but - 
1	3I	where do you think ? 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	okay . 
1	3I	yeah . 
2	3I	yeah , next to the deck chairs , and you have trunc all that stuff out on your deck . face cream . that was gonna be like , here . 
0	3I	half-inch tubing . 
1	3I	uh , maybe around - 
2	3I	well , i would probably put it here , but - 
2	3I	this is the best we have . 
0	3I	empty plastic - 
1	3I	jugs . maybe in the kitchen-y - yeah , in this kitchen - 
0	3I	thing . 
2	3I	i guess you 're gonna have to put it under shoelaces . 
1	3I	yeah . 
0	3I	we 're done ! 
0	6B	um . 
1	6B	yeah , what else would you cut ? 
0	6B	other than - yeah . you 're gonna cut sugar-free juice and - 
0	6B	oh . 
1	6B	nice . 
0	6B	yeah , i um - 
0	6B	we did that for one day in my high school . i forget , it was under my - we had a - 
0	6B	was it apes - ? 
0	6B	p_ environmental science . 
0	6B	bellevue high . 
0	6B	um , yeah , so we did that for one day . 
1	6B	that was a joke of the class . 
0	6B	uh , j_d_s_ , jewish day school . 
0	6B	yeah . although when i started , they didn't have t_b_t_ there yet . 
2	6B	um , and they built it . they like , cut down all our favorite trees . it was awful . it was so traumatic . yeah . and um , i remember like , in like second grade or something , and we 're all talking about , we 're gonna tie ourselves to the tree , and stuff . 
0	6B	anyway , so yeah , they built t_b_t_ there . um - 
0	6B	and - 
0	6B	yeah , so we started going there for - like , they 'd take us there during the day . um , 
1	6B	trunc nice . do you still attend ? 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	yeah , i think my mom - 
0	6B	she switched to something - 
0	6B	think she tried out a few - i know at one point , she was at hertzl . 
0	6B	um , but i never really went . 
0	6B	i dunno . yeah , after my bat mitzvah , and after like , not being in private school anymore , and kind of being - 
0	6B	and after living on my own , i 've um - 
0	6B	kind of - 
0	6B	let's see . 
0	6B	so when it says cutting , like the - 
0	6B	licenses , like boating licenses and stuff , is that - would that mean that - 
0	6B	people would not be able to get boating licenses ? or would that just sort of change the process ? 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	maybe there 's like , sort of a - 
1	6B	i don't know . i guess everything comes with um - 
0	6B	i dunno . trunc people hafta - people who enforce it , people who write the code behind it , people who - 
2	6B	maybe manufacture the licenses . but yeah , it does seem like a source of revenue , for sure . 
2	6B	maybe i wouldn't cut it , just make em more expensive . 
0	6B	um . 
0	6B	is that like not - 
0	6B	affiliated with the school ? 
0	6B	okay . 
2	6B	yeah . although that 's always hard because - 
2	6B	depending on how wealthy people are . 
2	6B	it just - i - it - it just sucks not having the same kind of - 
2	6B	like , school facilities as your neighboring school district , cuz they 're richer . but that - i - that 's how things are . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	sad . 
2	6B	yeah , soccer . yeah . 
0	6B	um . 
1	6B	it is - trunc yeah . it is . 
1	6B	um . i would - i could probably get rid of cooking classes . i have it in high school programs . i mean , we have - 
1	6B	i feel bad , cuz , you know , it's a creative - 
1	6B	outlet , and trunc i don't know . but - 
1	6B	i dunno . 
2	6B	screw em . 
2	6B	me neither . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	maybe , i dunno . 
1	6B	what about acting coaches ? 
2	6B	i like - i - i  like the arts . yeah . i - for some reason i feel a bit differently about that than cooking classes . cuz i feel like - 
1	6B	i dunno . i feel differently about it , i guess . 
1	6B	yeah ? 
1	6B	yeah , it's like a - 
2	6B	i feel like it's a development thing . it trunc it rounds out your development. 
1	6B	mm-hm . 
1	6B	yeah . true . yeah . 
1	6B	yeah , but for music stuff , you need like , private lessons . 
1	6B	if you don't have this . 
0	6B	um . 
0	6B	uh . 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	let's see here . 
0	6B	um . 
1	6B	it is , yeah . it's under my professional services . 
0	6B	um . 
2	6B	i trunc i - i feel like , the licenses - 
2	6B	should be revenue . 
2	6B	yeah . i agree . 
1	6B	i agree . 
0	6B	um . 
2	6B	no . or transportation . 
0	6B	oh . 
1	6B	i - i think you 're right . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	hm . 
1	6B	yeah , i don't honestly feel that strongly about it . 
0	6B	i don't know . 
0	6B	i don't know . 
2	6B	i - i don't know . i 've always felt a little weird about that . like - 
2	6B	if i had children , i would feel differently , but - 
2	6B	frankly , i just think it - yeah , it trunc it doesn't - people can be creeps and not be in this database . they could be uncaught sex offenders , or sex offenders waiting to happen . i - 
2	6B	yes . yes . that 's the trunc th- 
2	6B	that 's the reason - one of the reasons i feel iffy about it . cuz i just feel like - 
2	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	makes trunc makes em hard - hard to move on . kind of like having a 
2	6B	criminal history on your - 
2	6B	when you - on your job application . it just makes things harder to move on . 
2	6B	although , yeah . maybe i 'll feel different , if i - 
2	6B	had kids or something . but i - 
2	6B	i don't feel like it's that great of an idea . 
0	6B	um . 
2	6B	personally , i 'm not , like , a - 
1	6B	i don't - i 'm not a big fan of like , hunting and fishing . but i don't know if that - if my personal , like - 
1	6B	i don't know if that 's making it too personal . 
1	6B	maybe the people need to - 
2	6B	true . true . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . i - i agree . 
0	6B	trunc excuse me . 
1	6B	i don't know . i guess i was just sort of assuming it was like , sort of licenses . 
0	6B	i 've never had one . i dunno . 
0	6B	um . 
1	6B	like , basic cable free anyway ? 
1	6B	i mean , maybe it's not the same trunc kinda program - maybe people like these programs , but - 
1	6B	and there 's always radio . 
0	6B	alright . 
0	6B	um . hm . 
1	6B	do you wanna be done ? 
1	6B	maybe ? 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	i think we 're done . 
2	6B	what ? 
0	6B	i didn't know that they gave any . 
1	6B	that 's kinda crazy . 
3	6B	see , that 's sick . that 's just sick . 
2	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	in the northwest ? that 's crazy . oh , it made me sad . 
0	6B	okay . 
2	6B	yeah . yeah . trunc yeah . 
1	6B	hm . how many d'you wanna cut from each - ? or we could like , start with one and see how we - 
1	6B	okay . 
0	6B	uh , let's see . 
0	6B	education and programs . 
2	6B	cuz you can get students to volunteer to do that . 
2	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	alright . 
0	6B	okay . 
1	6B	that 's tough . cuz i trunc that 's an important one . 
1	6B	um . lem me look - take another look at this . i was - i saw that . i was thinking maybe weed control . 
0	6B	um . 
2	6B	i mean , maybe the sex offender thing . or - 
1	6B	you were talking about invasive - yeah , exactly . 
1	6B	yeah , i trunc um - i - i guess i 'm not familiar with - 
1	6B	how big of a problem invasive species are , and how much effort goes into them , and if that effort could be - 
1	6B	just as well done by like , volunteers slash students . i dunno . 
1	6B	or if maybe it's a bunch of people's full time jobs . i dunno . 
1	6B	well , we can get rid of it . 
1	6B	alright , so weed control and invasive species ? 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	let's see . 
0	6B	what are - 
0	6B	community news ads ? 
0	6B	what are they referring to ? 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	sure . yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	let's see , let's see . 
1	6B	public access station ? 
0	6B	hm . 
0	6B	yeah ? 
2	6B	the fans ? 
2	6B	yeah , i was just thinking , a clean - clean up , trunc is different than like , 
2	6B	true . 
0	6B	um . 
2	6B	don't take the kittens ! no ! 
0	6B	um - 
1	6B	yeah , that 's pretty much all the - 
1	6B	program you need to put into it . um . 
1	6B	i 'm trying to think trunc i mean , a dog catcher sounds trunc i - i - it's important , but i 'm trying to think - 
1	6B	i mean , what would happen without - yeah . 
2	6B	yeah . which trunc it says for dogs . i 'm just - i 'm hoping they would also do - 
1	6B	dog - i mean , yeah . it says for cats . they should do dogs too , though . 
1	6B	but we have veterinary hospital , so maybe it could happen through that . 
1	6B	and dog catcher ? 
1	6B	alright . alright . 
2	6B	um . lady and the tramp ? you 're probably thinking ? god . trunc that was awful . awful . i would - i would like , start - 
0	6B	almost crying when i watched that . and like especially - they had - they had like , the song or something that - and they showed all these little puppies , and they had like a puppy sticking his nose through the crack , and whining , and i just - 
0	6B	i was like , a seven year old . i couldn't - not handle that . 
0	6B	or whenever i watched it . 
2	6B	oh god . 
0	6B	i still can't really handle it . 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	um . 
1	6B	i think you had a good idea , with just privatizing taxi stuff . 
1	6B	so that 's one . 
1	6B	but i 'm trunc i just - i guess i don't quite understand how they work . whether - if you cut that , what would happen ? whether it - whether people would like have a harder time getting licenses , or would have to go through someone else , or - 
1	6B	trunc or - i dunno . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	well like , if it's a big city , especially , they could come and get their license , and then go - 
1	6B	work somewhere else . 
1	6B	i dunno . um . 
1	6B	yeah . yeah . 
1	6B	yeah , i trunc i think a lotta the transportation stuff's important . 
2	6B	yeah . yeah , now i think about it , i mean - 
1	6B	lincoln and whatever , trunc aren't they all private ? 
2	6B	alright , yeah . let's do that . 
0	6B	okay . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	i don't like cutting things in general . 
0	6B	yeah , i noticed in the - in the - first activity . 
0	6B	oh . 
1	6B	alright . 
2	6B	yeah . unless - yeah . maybe they wanted to cut everything . but that 's not gonna happen . 
2	6B	thank you . thank you . alright . 
0	6B	yeah .
