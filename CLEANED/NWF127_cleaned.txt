1	3I	so -
1	3I	i think the first question is -
1	3I	how many aisles do you think this is ?
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	we will .
1	3I	so essentially , we 're looking at -
1	3I	four aisles . kay ?
1	3I	and it looks like this is already set up for , like , home supplies .
1	3I	and that kind of migrates around here .
1	3I	this seems to be more personal , like toys and travel guides .
1	3I	this looks like more staples .
1	3I	yeah . this is , like , bulk cooking .
1	3I	um , cuz you never buy -
1	3I	just one cup of sugar .
1	3I	and then this at least over here looks like -
1	3I	the refrigerated section .
0	3I	cool ?
0	3I	right .
0	3I	okay .
0	3I	yes .
0	3I	heavy coats .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	right .
1	3I	i think -
1	3I	it would make most sense in the aisle here with travel guides and toys .
0	3I	um -
1	3I	would you put them next to the toys or the travel guides and mousetraps ?
1	3I	i think so .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	what if we - ?
1	3I	arranged them - ?
1	3I	here - ?
1	3I	so it went in a u_ shape , essentially , from the travel guides to the toys ?
1	3I	and then if there 's , like , hats and backpacks we can put them after the toys .
1	3I	kay , so -
1	3I	okay , so heavy coats next to the travel guides .
1	3I	agreed .
0	3I	bars of soap .
1	3I	how bout right next to the toilet paper ?
1	3I	do we feel like - ?
1	3I	putting it behind the toilet paper , or before ?
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	cool .
2	3I	right , or should they go next to cake mix ?
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	okay .
0	3I	yes .
0	3I	gas powered cook stoves .
1	3I	i think on the far aisle here .
0	3I	um -
1	3I	should i go between boating supplies and siding ?
1	3I	or in - closer toward power cords ?
1	3I	okay , we 'll put them next to the boating supplies .
1	3I	awesome .
0	3I	books .
1	3I	how bout we put them next to the travel guides ?
1	3I	agreed .
0	3I	fish hooks .
1	3I	how bout right next to the boating supplies ?
1	3I	cuz you need a boat to fish , most of the time .
1	3I	cool ?
1	3I	sounds good .
0	3I	backpacks .
1	3I	what if we put the backpacks on the other side of the toys , about mid-aisle ?
1	3I	that give us more room for overflow .
0	3I	uh -
1	3I	clothing .
1	3I	cool .
0	3I	rolls of duct tape .
1	3I	how bout right near the power cords ?
1	3I	would you suggest before or after ?
1	3I	let 's do before .
2	3I	or would we like to put them next to the backpacks ?
1	3I	in case there 's more -
0	3I	like -
1	3I	abdominal covering clothing .
0	3I	yes .
0	3I	sticks of butter .
1	3I	i would vote for next to the eggs .
1	3I	my initial thought was exercise .
1	3I	but it could also be some sort of -
1	3I	item for camping , to help hold stuff down .
1	3I	since there is no other exercise equipment , i 'm willing to go with the second definition .
1	3I	cool .
1	3I	sounds good .
0	3I	and i 've got heavy cable here .
1	3I	where do you think we should put this ?
2	3I	what if we give it a - a little bit of space , and put the heavy cable here ?
0	3I	yes .
0	3I	they 're not disposable .
1	3I	kay , so we 've got the thick sweaters .
1	3I	my inclination is to put them next to the large vests .
1	3I	oh , absolutely .
1	3I	sounds good .
0	3I	small axes .
1	3I	um , i would put them -
1	3I	obviously in this aisle here .
1	3I	what if - ?
0	3I	hmm .
1	3I	i feel like it should be closer to the end .
1	3I	so near the power cords , but not too close .
0	3I	going wild and crazy .
2	3I	or -
1	3I	uh , yeah . let 's do it .
0	3I	scissors .
0	3I	the question is are they small scissors , like - ?
0	3I	eyebrow scissors ?
0	3I	or are they gigantic scissors ?
1	3I	cuz we are co-managers at this imaginary store .
1	3I	um , fantastic question .
1	3I	let 's put them next to the small axes .
1	3I	yes . cuz -
1	3I	that 's just the area where they cut things .
0	3I	okay .
1	3I	what if we put the fresh produce aisle on -
1	3I	the opposite side of the refrigerated section ?
1	3I	sounds great .
0	3I	and i 've got pouches of oatmeal .
1	3I	which to me indicates a bulk item , that 's non-perishable so i would put it by the dried figs .
1	3I	what about next to the bottles of juice ?
0	3I	and i have flags -
1	3I	so that seems to be a home item .
1	3I	what would you think about putting them between the siding and the cushions ?
1	3I	i will actually put it before the siding .
1	3I	because you could take a flag camping , if you would like ,
1	3I	what if we put it next to mousetraps ?
1	3I	and it feels like the camping outdoor ware section would be looking for something more durable than paper .
0	3I	light jackets .
1	3I	what if -
0	3I	so -
1	3I	what if we put them right up here ?
1	3I	close to the toys ?
1	3I	but not too close .
1	3I	yeah , almost like it 's an endcap .
1	3I	cuz it 's fall , and -
1	3I	we do n't quite need the heavy jackets yet , so let 's trunc popularize the light jackets .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	i agree .
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	empty plastic jugs .
1	3I	it does . what if we put it right next to the buckets ?
1	3I	it is .
1	3I	yeah !
0	3I	i did n't know they sold bundles of sticks .
0	3I	okay .
0	3I	cool .
0	3I	pre-cut wood .
1	3I	what if we put them across from the bundles of sticks ?
1	3I	so you can turn around -
1	3I	and have sticks and then wood .
1	3I	perfect .
0	3I	books of matches .
1	3I	what if we put them -
1	3I	close to paper bags ?
1	3I	because they are all disposable type household items .
0	3I	okay ?
1	3I	i would put them next to the home container section .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	and our favorite , wetsuits .
1	3I	so my inclination is to actually put them across from boating supplies .
0	3I	does that make sense ? okay .
0	3I	so they are right next to the five pound weights .
1	3I	awesome .
1	3I	sounds good .
0	3I	face cream .
1	3I	my inclination is to put it right next to the toothpaste .
1	3I	my inclination would be to put it toward -
1	3I	the other stuff you drink .
1	3I	we - that 's the word .
1	3I	right maybe toward the end of the aisle .
0	3I	so we have tow ropes .
0	3I	boating supplies .
1	3I	this is a type of rope , and we do have long ropey type things .
1	3I	here .
1	3I	so , let 's put it between the heavy cable and the duct tape .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	yeah , me too .
1	3I	cool .
0	3I	half inch tubing .
1	3I	could we sneak that between the canvas bags and heavy cable ?
2	3I	what if -
2	3I	we put it trunc between the tweezers cuz this is a lot of random stuff tweezers you do n't buy all the time shoelaces you do n't buy all the time .
1	3I	yes .
0	3I	kay , chocolate bars .
1	3I	i know .
1	3I	should we put those before the sugar ?
1	3I	kay .
1	3I	because -
1	3I	beets just look so lonely .
1	3I	but i do n't know if we have like items .
1	3I	we 'll just start talking to the ice cream .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	kay .
1	3I	yeah !
0	3I	fleece lined boots .
1	3I	what about next to the hats ?
1	3I	i will let you make the decision .
1	3I	kay cans of peas .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	it does n't specify if it 's fresh beets .
1	3I	or non-fresh beats .
1	3I	yes .
0	3I	um -
1	3I	i feel like this is the most logical place for it .
1	3I	so we 'll put the canned peas near the peas , but not right next door .
1	3I	sure .
1	3I	i would say near the back .
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	socks .
1	3I	let 's put them between the boots and the toys .
1	3I	i think we will .
1	3I	cool .
0	3I	and fishing nets .
1	3I	what if i put them right above pre-cut wood ?
1	3I	and good job ! that 's our last item .
1	3I	yes .
1	3I	i like how we were talking about , uh wanting to reorganize it .
0	6B	so , how many should we cut from - ?
1	6B	what 's the easiest one to look at first ?
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	okay .
0	6B	right .
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	i do n't think so .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	should we go list by list ?
0	6B	well -
0	6B	let 's see .
2	6B	i think special education teachers are very important .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	i think speech therapy 's important , as well as sex ed .
1	6B	uh , how to you trunc t do you think is most important to keep ?
1	6B	right .
1	6B	absolutely .
1	6B	right .
0	6B	yes .
1	6B	so , it sounds like we 're going to postpone and currently cut the football equipment and the sugar free juice machines .
1	6B	co-
1	6B	cooking classes ?
1	6B	that seems to be something where if someone wants to learn to cook -
1	6B	they can go online . they can read a book . it 's not necessarily a social activity .
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	too much argument ?
1	6B	okay .
0	6B	public health and safety .
1	6B	what do you think is -
1	6B	uh , most important . or what do you think we can do without ?
2	6B	what if it 's a food safety issue ?
2	6B	and if it 's a food safety issue that goes out into the community and beyond and people get sick , then it reflects poorly on our community .
0	6B	yes .
1	6B	okay .
0	6B	okay .
0	6B	so we 've got one .
1	6B	uh , what about the hospital additions ?
2	6B	so , i feel reproductive education is very important .
2	6B	chicken pox trunc chicken pox trunc vaccinations , also very important . needle exchange and the sex offender database -
2	6B	and prenatal check-ups , i think are all very very important .
0	6B	hmm . right .
1	6B	yes , and when i read that i thought of a point person within the police department that -
1	6B	supports all the neighborhood watches .
1	6B	which is great -
1	6B	but i feel like we could get a volunteer or and intern -
1	6B	to do that .
1	6B	and the police will still be available if there 's an immediate hey so and so this person 's breaking into some person 's house .
1	6B	so it sounds like -
1	6B	we would be okay with cutting neighborhood watch -
1	6B	and weed control .
1	6B	and hospital additions .
1	6B	so we 're good there .
1	6B	how do you feel about recreation and public services ?
0	6B	right .
2	6B	i 'm a big football fan .
2	6B	and i can see the benefits that a football team would bring to an area .
2	6B	because it brings a lot of people in . it brings publicity to the area .
2	6B	so , i am not as excited to cut that .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	what if -
0	6B	let 's see -
0	6B	so -
1	6B	yeah , it seems like we could ask the veterinary hospital to take over stray cat spaying .
1	6B	and -
1	6B	kitten and puppy adoption , do you think the hospital would have - ?
1	6B	some services or some people who would be willing to - ?
1	6B	take that over ?
1	6B	because that would also expand their reach .
1	6B	within the community .
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	what about the reusable bag campaign ?
1	6B	right .
1	6B	is it essential ?
1	6B	cool .
0	6B	on to infrastructure and licensing .
0	6B	so -
1	6B	i vote cutting additional bus stops .
0	6B	so we 've got one .
1	6B	that 's good .
1	6B	right , or they call them .
0	6B	so we 've got two .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	speed limit signs are important .
0	6B	i 'm a little confused about the subway system . is it already operable ?
0	6B	or are they building it ?
0	6B	so as the -
0	6B	governors of this city - i know that 's the wrong word . we 'll go with mayors , co-mayors .
0	6B	do we have a subway system ?
1	6B	okay .
2	6B	let 's do it .
1	6B	right .
1	6B	and , i 'm a little confused what you repair on a flagpole other than repainting it .
1	6B	so we are getting rid of -
0	6B	wow , my stomach is making a lot of noises i guess .
0	6B	apparently i 'm just hungry .
1	6B	flagpole repair .
1	6B	additional bus stops .
0	6B	and -
1	6B	taxi stops .
1	6B	so -
1	6B	we 're all done !
