1	3I	so this is going to be really similar to -
2	3I	this actually looks a lot like
2	3I	your
2	3I	list . because look .
2	3I	more food , and then the
1	3I	toys , and er -
0	3I	mm .
0	3I	oh , except travel guides . that was down in
0	3I	the other -
0	3I	with the books .
0	3I	mm-kay .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	sure .
0	3I	liters of water .
1	3I	would you say this aisle ?
1	3I	me too .
1	3I	maybe into -
1	3I	does it matter to you ?
0	3I	travel guides , siding , mouse traps .
1	3I	maybe we can put it down here , for -
0	3I	um .
1	3I	power cords and -
1	3I	i dunno . things that you might have in your garage .
1	3I	or for camping . is that it ?
1	3I	yeah . totally .
0	3I	scissors .
2	3I	probably in the same supplies , right ? with power cords ?
1	3I	oh , that 's true .
1	3I	we can put it wherever we want .
1	3I	i think -
2	3I	because i do n't think there were any other art supplies , i would put scissors with art supplies .
2	3I	so , i think instead , i might put it in the - um - kinda the utility -
1	3I	maybe yeah , with the duct tape .
2	3I	those are similar . they 're - i think they 're probably really heavy duty scissors .
0	3I	okay .
2	3I	would you also say with scissors ? like with other - ?
1	3I	i know .
1	3I	okay i 'll put it across from scissors .
2	3I	oh . also on this one .
2	3I	up here , you think ?
1	3I	kay .
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts .
1	3I	i 'd have to say over here .
2	3I	with the trunc with the sugar , and the ice cream , the sweets ? cake mix ?
1	3I	mm-kay .
2	3I	um , maybe up here ?
1	3I	okay , with the tubing .
1	3I	kay , where do we want - ? oh , there 's eggs and soybeans .
2	3I	over here .
1	3I	mm-hm mm-kay .
2	3I	put it in th-
1	3I	this is going to be -
1	3I	maybe produce
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	bottles of juice .
0	3I	okay .
2	3I	i would put it over here , too , probably , in the food .
2	3I	not over here . you would n't have that in your garage .
1	3I	maybe in the middle .
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	oh yes .
1	3I	kay .
0	3I	hats .
0	3I	we do n't have clothing yet .
1	3I	should we put it in the middle ?
0	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	mm-kay . good idea . cuz we 'll probably have more clothing items .
1	3I	shoe laces .
1	3I	face cream . totally .
0	3I	small axes ?
0	3I	mm .
0	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	kay yeah traveling with axes .
1	3I	yep perfect .
1	3I	fishing net up by boating supplies ?
0	3I	okay .
1	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	with toys ?
1	3I	okay i think in mine , it was next to travel guides , but i like it better up here .
2	3I	way better up there .
1	3I	sticks of butter . next to eggs ?
1	3I	dairy ?
2	3I	oh , but ice cream 's up there . oh well .
1	3I	gas powered cook stoves how about next to the electric heaters ?
1	3I	next to light jackets ? okay .
2	3I	i would think so , too .
0	3I	uh - egg timers ?
0	3I	is that - ?
0	3I	like for hard boiled egg- ?
2	3I	i think it would go with probably -
1	3I	on the little siding next to the eggs .
1	3I	although it could belong in other places .
0	3I	buckets .
1	3I	here ?
1	3I	oh , yeah .
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	that sounds good .
0	3I	bagels .
0	3I	did you say bagels ?
1	3I	should this be down - ? since we do n't really have baked goods we have the doughnuts and cookies , but-
1	3I	maybe it should .
1	3I	to make room .
2	3I	what is peat moss ? that goes over here , right ?
1	3I	maybe .
0	3I	kay . bags of peat moss .
0	3I	large cups .
0	3I	not really .
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	all the extras . heavy cable . here ? here ?
1	3I	kay .
1	3I	maybe trunc next to power cords .
0	3I	kay .
2	3I	obviously .
2	3I	i think it would go in here , too .
0	3I	cases of whiskey .
1	3I	next to the large cups ?
2	3I	no , i think it should go in the food aisle .
2	3I	the liquids and food . cuz we do n't really have any of that over here .
0	3I	oh , yeah .
2	3I	no , it should go at the top or the bottom , probably .
1	3I	i do n't know how many liquids we 'll have . probably - yeah . should we just go up ?
1	3I	you need sugar to mix drinks sometimes . tow ropes ? how about next to the other cables ?
1	3I	um yeah . perfect .
1	3I	yeah .
2	3I	into - weird other supplies ? i think it fits more into the -
1	3I	this sort of a thing . do - should i fill in this spot up here ?
2	3I	kay , risky .
0	3I	backpacks .
1	3I	would you put it over here , too ?
1	3I	for like , backpacking ?
1	3I	or would it be school supplies ?
0	3I	mm-hm .
2	3I	mm-hm i would still be inclined to put it here . this is like r_e_i_ to me . they have a lot of backpacks . yeah .
2	3I	it - yeah , it depends .
1	3I	okay . where do you think - ? just -
1	3I	maybe down here ?
0	3I	okay . chocolate bars .
1	3I	with the sweets ?
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	yeah , i would put it over here um .
1	3I	i kinda wan na put it right in the middle .
1	3I	yeah .
2	3I	it does n't really make sense .
2	3I	just because it does n't really belong in either ends of what we 're going with . but it does - it should go in - it should go in the garage .
0	3I	okay .
1	3I	next to paper ?
1	3I	and duct tape ? kay .
0	3I	mint tooth paste .
1	3I	here .
1	3I	yep .
1	3I	yeah maybe we should put it with the other um -
2	3I	fruits and vegetables . that 's where it is in trader joe 's . the figs .
0	3I	yep .
1	3I	maybe up here , with all - we 've got a lotta fishing .
2	3I	so , trunc that should go up there . but really -
0	3I	kay .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	more bundles of sticks . how bout down here ?
1	3I	also over here , do you think ?
1	3I	um , maybe just right up here ?
2	3I	okay . i 'm putting it right here , too .
0	3I	yeah , we have a lot in this one .
1	3I	i would put that in our random section . maybe .
0	3I	yeah
2	3I	cuz pet food was there . we could n't have moved that into food .
1	3I	so now it 's just kind of like -
1	3I	an extra aisle ?
1	3I	maybe seasonal things ?
0	3I	mm-kay .
0	3I	socks .
2	3I	i 'll put it up here by hats .
1	3I	kay .
0	3I	um .
1	3I	maybe here ?
1	3I	some breakfast stuff , kind of ?
2	3I	i mean , the doughnuts . the doughnuts could be .
1	3I	down here ? soy beans ?
0	3I	kay .
2	3I	i think we did a really good job .
0	3I	alright , heather .
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	should we figure - ? okay .
1	6B	maybe we should decide a couple to - we can talk though them all , but we can decide maybe a couple to cut . like maybe two to cut . from each category .
1	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	then , that just keeps it easy , and even .
0	6B	mm-kay . math tutors .
0	6B	assistant cooks .
2	6B	sex ed . custodians . well we ca n't cut speech therapy . that 's the only one i know about .
2	6B	okay . you hafta have custodians , you hafta have sex ed . assistant cooks ?
0	6B	yeah , i 'm not sure . or if it 's just within the schools ?
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	like new football equipment ?
1	6B	trunc mm-kay . so we have - that might be one we wan na cut .
1	6B	acting coaches ?
2	6B	yeah , i - yeah . we hafta -
1	6B	decide . okay , we can keep -
2	6B	acting , poetry , special ed teachers . we hafta have those . cooking classes ?
1	6B	yeah . i think so too .
1	6B	note-takers ? yes .
2	6B	that can go .
1	6B	no .
2	6B	i think that one definitely hasta go . i understand why it 's there .
3	6B	because i think - no , i think that 's fine . the sugar-free juices . and i - what it stands for , but i think all the moms can pack sugar-free juice if they need to .
0	6B	bookkeeping classes ?
1	6B	i 'd say yes . music teachers ? yes .
2	6B	okay , so , let 's trunc let 's cut - if we hafta cut two things , let 's cut sugar-free juice machines . if that 's okay with you .
1	6B	okay . and football equipment ?
1	6B	can - assuming that it 's new equipment , each year .
0	6B	kay .
0	6B	kay , moving on .
0	6B	reproductive education ?
2	6B	yes .
1	6B	i think it just goes back to those other categories . it can be under both .
1	6B	job-training programs ? i would say yes .
1	6B	chicken pox vaccinations ? yes .
2	6B	right ?
0	6B	they do vaccinations now . mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-mm .
1	6B	i know .
1	6B	okay , we 'll put it on - we 'll put it on the maybe list .
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	yes .
0	6B	you know -
0	6B	we have -
0	6B	and reproductive education .
2	6B	okay , so that might be on the maybe list too , cuz that could go under - that will go under - okay , yeah , that 's - that 's one of ours .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah . i 'm thinking the sex ed is more of the younger age , and then reproductive education is once they actually do - they 're pregnant
2	6B	i think it is . i think we should put that on our -
2	6B	maybe list .
0	6B	toxic waste disposal ?
1	6B	yes .
0	6B	hospital additions ?
0	6B	um , maybe new -
0	6B	departments ? or new -
2	6B	i think that 's important .
2	6B	i think so .
1	6B	depending on what the need is , for the community .
1	6B	needle exchange ? yes . sex offender database ?
2	6B	yes .
0	6B	veterans medical assistance ?
1	6B	i think , yes .
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	not as important .
1	6B	we have the invasive species removal .
1	6B	okay .
0	6B	prenatal check-ups ?
2	6B	it should . that might be more under the medical side , though . the education might be more under -
2	6B	they might be two different , you know , programs doing that .
2	6B	yeah , i think we do need to keep the prenatal check-ups .
0	6B	and neighborhood watch support .
0	6B	give away ?
2	6B	mm-kay . for funding . well , we only need to choose two .
1	6B	that need to go . if we want to keep it even .
0	6B	we were gon na take out -
1	6B	we were definitely going to take out s_t_d_ education , cuz that fell under what we 're already paying for , over here .
1	6B	and then , what 's the next least important one ?
2	6B	or weed control .
0	6B	weed control ?
1	6B	okay . we 'll keep the other ones .
0	6B	mm-kay .
0	6B	kay , recreation ? and public services .
2	6B	that one 's tough .
1	6B	lotsa stray cats , okay . okay . community news ads .
2	6B	i 'd say put that in the no list too . we 'll decide - we 'll prioritize after .
2	6B	food bank ? yes .
0	6B	junior soccer league ?
1	6B	i 'd say yes , compared to the other ones .
1	6B	probably .
1	6B	yeah . i agree .
2	6B	well , if we gave - if we stop spaying the cats , then yeah , we 're gon na need that .
1	6B	uh-huh , yes . housing assistance ? yes .
0	6B	dog catcher ?
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	mm . maybe that trunc we 'll hafta decide that later .
2	6B	oh . where are the girls ?
0	6B	yep .
1	6B	okay . just to make a trunc tatement .
0	6B	public access station ?
0	6B	do n't quite know what that is .
0	6B	like where resources ? oh . oh , okay .
1	6B	it 's trunc is that one of the more expensive things ?
0	6B	okay .
1	6B	so maybe we 're keeping it at the minimum .
1	6B	veterinary hospital ? probably .
0	6B	football stadium upkeep ?
1	6B	we probably need that .
1	6B	kay .
0	6B	and pest control .
1	6B	we probably do .
2	6B	so , we 're going to cut boys basketball . to make a statement .
1	6B	oh , i would say -
1	6B	community news ads .
1	6B	cuz i do n't -
1	6B	totally know what that is .
1	6B	i 'd say we cut it .
0	6B	kay .
0	6B	next .
1	6B	teaching certificates ? yes . speed limit signs ?
1	6B	we do n't - kay , we do n't need those . okay . additional bus stops ?
2	6B	oh . we might be - we might be increasing the stops . so , let 's keep that .
2	6B	i think our transportation actually runs really well right now .
2	6B	we may not need the extra ones . we 'll hafta see . tattoo artist licenses ?
2	6B	that does n't seem like it should fall under our umbrella .
0	6B	oh . to do that ?
1	6B	that 's actually a good point .
1	6B	okay .
1	6B	yes .
1	6B	pothole maintenance ? i 'd say yeah .
0	6B	subway system ?
2	6B	that 's tough .
2	6B	because we do n't know where we are , in the process
0	6B	hunting tags .
1	6B	probably .
0	6B	so -
0	6B	i do n't really know what that is , but -
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	but we want that so things do n't get outta control .
1	6B	like the tattooing .
1	6B	yeah , might fall into another -
1	6B	rural area ?
1	6B	kay , well , we 'll come back to that one .
0	6B	towing services ?
1	6B	okay . that 'll be on our list then . this one 's tough . this one 's a little more tough .
0	6B	massage certificates ?
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	because -
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	i - that kinda falls under the other ones . i can see why they put it in there . like tattoo artists and teaching . but i think massage is different .
0	6B	kay .
0	6B	taxi stops ?
1	6B	we probably do n't need to do that either .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	okay , yeah . that 'll help .
2	6B	yeah , that 's true . it 's hard to know if we 're implementing these , or if we 're just -
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	fishing licenses ? yes .
1	6B	public bus upkeep ? yes . drainage trunc ditches ?
0	6B	yes . okay , so we have massage certificates to get rid of .
2	6B	and then the other one that i think was the most obvious was the towing services .
2	6B	the other ones were a little bit harder .
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	oh , s_t_d_ - no that - we had three , on our list . potentially .
0	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	cuz we - cuz we were supportive of the arts .
1	6B	yeah , we could do that .
2	6B	i think we 're good on cutting two .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah , i think so too .
2	6B	i think they 're all very justified .
0	6B	subway trunc
