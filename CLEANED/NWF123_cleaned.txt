1	3I	that 's it . 
1	3I	we 're done ! 
2	6B	so , given that they keep changing the way they teach math , i think math tutors are pretty essential 
1	6B	i don't know bout it . 
1	6B	yeah , that 's what i 'm looking at too . 
1	6B	at least they 've rationalized the groups . 
1	6B	we could go through - well , we should say all the words i guess , so we should go one by one or i was thinking we could knock out the ones that seem inessential right off the bat . 
1	6B	that 's right . 
1	6B	yes . 
1	6B	right . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	but they can use the equipment - 
2	6B	they had from last year , can't they ? 
1	6B	or what - what's the rest of your thinking about - ? 
1	6B	no . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	so , are we gonna x_ out football equipment ? 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	 acting coaches . 
2	6B	to me there 's a lot of things that can be done by the non-profit community . 
0	6B	um - 
1	6B	you know ? 
1	6B	there 's a lot of voluntary people enjoy acting . 
2	6B	really ? but a coach ? 
2	6B	i mean maybe you had trunc school play and the english teacher kinda was the director and - 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	poetry books . well , a few of those should be - 
1	6B	available . yeah . 
2	6B	you have to have special ed teachers , i think . 
1	6B	i agree . 
2	6B	well - 
2	6B	oh , and then the kids wouldn't buy them if they weren't all sugared up ? 
1	6B	oh ! 
1	6B	okay . 
1	6B	that 's right . they do . 
1	6B	so , we the county don't have to pay for the juice machines . 
1	6B	okay . 
1	6B	they put that - they put aspartame or trunc or those other things in there , right . 
1	6B	okay . 
1	6B	uh , acting coaches we - we got rid of them . 
0	6B	that 's three . 
1	6B	it is . 
2	6B	it's essential . 
0	6B	sugar free juice machines . 
1	6B	i think so . yeah . 
2	6B	reproductive education . i guess that 's outside of the schools , but i think it's very important . 
0	6B	job training . 
1	6B	yep . 
1	6B	now the - 
2	6B	but non - non-profits and , you know , recreation groups do that - that stuff . they get volunteers going . 
0	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	yeah to - that 's true . 
0	6B	do you work with earthcorps , or - ? 
0	6B	oh , i 've heard - i have heard of that , yeah . 
0	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	really ? wow . 
1	6B	so , we haven't gotten rid of anything yet , have we ? 
1	6B	that 's right . 
1	6B	what about hospital additions though ? you like those bagels , i know , but - 
2	6B	i think those ought to be private sector since most of the hospitals are - 
2	6B	privatized . 
2	6B	institutions . 
0	6B	oh , okay . 
1	6B	is it . we 've just had a big scandal . right . 
0	6B	alright . 
1	6B	that 's right . 
2	6B	okay , and wouldn't weed control be trunc part of a invasive - invasive species removal ? 
1	6B	well , you know they 're not always - 
1	6B	right . that 's right , get some efficiency . 
1	6B	the so we 've gotten trunc veteran's medical out , and egg out on the basis that they 're already covered by the feds . 
0	6B	oh ! 
1	6B	yes , good . i 'm glad you agree on that .

0	6B	yeah , yeah . 
0	6B	no . 
0	6B	like c_span would be something - 
0	6B	uh-huh . 
0	6B	uh-huh . 
0	6B	huh . 
0	6B	well - 
0	6B	got spaying 
1	6B	that 's like humane society . 
1	6B	you 're right . 
1	6B	public news station , i can't think what that would be . i mean trunc it could be public radio or p_b_ like - 
0	6B	uh-huh . 
0	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	right . 
1	6B	trunc yeah . trunc trunc and all kinds of people cam come in and do all kinds of things of varying worth 
1	6B	on those , right ? 
1	6B	okay , so we could get rid of the public access station , and let the cable stations - 
1	6B	put those on . that 's true . 
1	6B	that 's true they are yeah . 
1	6B	so they can - they can - we can take that out . 
0	6B	for taking out .

0	6B	junior soccer . 
0	6B	ball club , and public access station ? which the cable guys 'll do . 
0	6B	right . 
1	6B	it effects our solid waste management , and therefore the county budget . 
0	6B	ooh . 
0	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	yep . 
0	6B	yeah , trunc trunc we 're accepting pest control . we 've got three out of there so , we 're going - okay .

0	6B	oh . well - 
0	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	i 'm sure there is . 
0	6B	subway system . 
1	6B	that 's a big ticket item , and we don't know enough about it to know - 
0	6B	oh f- 
1	6B	right , and trunc the feds will always be in it too . 
2	6B	do trunc ? does that need to be - ?

1	6B	probably - 
1	6B	we can wait til next year . 
0	6B	i - i 'm - 
0	6B	well - 
2	6B	i think it's a frill . 
0	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	but - 
2	6B	is it trunc well , wouldn't it require , though - ? 
2	6B	um , posting , you know those taxis only zones , and painting the curbs sometimes , and - ? 
0	6B	port of seattle . 
0	6B	yep . 
1	6B	taxis should be paying for it in any case , cuz they 're a private business , right ?
