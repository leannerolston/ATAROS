0	3I	right there . you were just - it 's right - right above your hand , there yeah , keep going . there you go .
2	3I	mm .
2	3I	maybe on the side , where ice cream is .
2	3I	boxes of doughnuts . i 'm presuming they probably go by the chocolate bars and the ice cream .
1	3I	exactly .
1	3I	uh , sticks of butter , maybe down by the eggs and bagels .
1	3I	fishing net . probably up by the boating supplies and sticks .
1	3I	and thick sweaters , probably by the heavy coats and vests .
2	3I	yeah , or the jugs and buckets . i mean , they 're all kinda close together , though . so probably does n't really matter .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	mm , maybe where the cases of whiskey are .
0	3I	um , loose-leaf paper . hm .
1	3I	yeah , do n't really have any - i guess there 's books . we could put it by that , maybe .
1	3I	uh , liters of water , probably down there where the juice was .
1	3I	and then scissors , presumably where the paper and books are .
0	3I	hm .
2	3I	yeah , or the boating supplies there , yeah .
1	3I	hm , probably up with the jackets and sweaters .
1	3I	yeah .
0	3I	let 's see . uh , gas-powered cookstove .
1	3I	probably with the -
1	3I	yeah .
2	3I	um , bags of peat moss , um , i 'd say that probably gon na go where - like , where pet food 's gon na go . maybe just , like , garage , storage .
0	3I	um , heavy cable .
1	3I	hm , probably where the buckets and jugs are .
2	3I	and then five-pound weights , um , probably where the toys are . maybe , like , the activities room or something .
1	3I	yeah .
2	3I	mm , probably put it down with the axes and power cords .
0	3I	lower left .
1	3I	yeah probably .
0	3I	uh , it 's right under the boat , there . top - top left . bundles of sticks .
2	3I	alright , let 's do all four ! go crazy .
0	3I	uh , wetsuits .
1	3I	probably go with the boating supplies .
0	3I	electric heaters , um -
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	socks , probably up with shoelaces and boots and so on .
1	3I	and tow ropes , probably with heavy cable and buckets , and -
0	3I	yeah .
1	6B	i think on education , for me , it would be either -
1	6B	uh , trunc juice machines .
1	6B	um -
1	6B	is that in there ? oh i did n't see that , yeah . trunc well , and acting coaches , i mean -
1	6B	trunc the -
2	6B	it seems to me trunc trunc that one 's a lot more longer term than just taking a cooking class and learning how to feed your own family , so it -
2	6B	would seem like that 's a trunc a lower priority .
1	6B	right , so maybe if we cut both that - cooking classes and the juice machines .
0	6B	hm .
1	6B	right .
1	6B	oh , yeah , that 's true .
1	6B	trunc yeah , nuke it i 'd say get rid of it .
2	6B	yeah , books are pretty cheap , though . comparatively .
1	6B	hm , so - football -
1	6B	cooking classes and juice machines , then ?
2	6B	mm .
0	6B	kay .
1	6B	yeah , i do n't think weed control is high priority . uh , neighborhood watch support , i think i 'd probably let them manage that themselves .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah , definitely .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	right .
2	6B	yeah , i mean , that 's three . cuz if we do the additions and the weed control , neighborhood watch support , that 's three .
1	6B	right , right .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	yeah i think my first thing to do would be to cut the stadium upkeep .
1	6B	right .
0	6B	um -
2	6B	uh pest control , i think i might be w-
2	6B	interested in that - getting rid of that , too , cuz that 's usually -
2	6B	overhead spraying and things like that that are n't optimal .
1	6B	right .
1	6B	may not be in seattle .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	right .
1	6B	right .
1	6B	right .
1	6B	so , if we get three , what would they be , then ? maybe fishing and hunting , and -
0	6B	uh -
2	6B	over taxi stops ?
2	6B	but then that 's four things .
2	6B	well , cuz we 've only been doing three on the lists .
3	6B	right , cuz that - the -
2	6B	but those - i mean , the flip side is that those allow people to start businesses .
2	6B	whereas a fishing license and a hunting tag is a much , much smaller -
2	6B	they make money on them too , but it 's a much , much smaller person - i mean , they 're f-
2	6B	for better or for worse , there 's far more tattoo parlors in town than there are hunters , probably .
0	6B	um -
1	6B	so i mean , it -
1	6B	right .
1	6B	right .
2	6B	well what about taxi stops , though ?
2	6B	no , but i mean getting rid of that instead of massage or tattoo .
2	6B	because those are n't really -
2	6B	a taxi stop is just a - one more parking spot that does n't get charged for .
1	6B	right ?
1	6B	yell on the corner . right .
1	6B	right .
1	6B	right .
0	6B	so then , what would be the three , then ?
0	6B	right .
1	6B	cool .
1	6B	yeah , definitely .
