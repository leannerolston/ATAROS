0	3I	and then i 've got loose leaf paper .
1	3I	which we do n't really have an office supply section but - yeah , they can go with the travel guides .
0	3I	i 've got some packages of cookies .

2	3I	i 've got some backpacks . which go great with loose leaf paper .
2	3I	alright . i 've got some empty plastic jugs . which are fairly utilitarian but still trunc somewhat miscellaneous .
2	3I	so we 'll put that with the canvas bags . it 's looking like it 's just things that carry other things .
1	3I	alright .
2	3I	bagels . i 'm going to put underneath the package of cookies .
2	3I	mm-kay . i 've got some egg timers that i 'm putting with the larger cups , just above the there .

2	3I	right over those thick sweaters . so you can label that so - then - i 'm putting those right underneath the thick sweaters .
0	3I	alright .
1	3I	and across and trunc up from cases of whiskey . so also celebratory .
1	3I	so looks like we 're done .
2	6B	let 's just go left to right .
0	6B	math tutors .
1	6B	math tutors are pretty important .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	um . assistant cooks .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	yeah . uh we 're not going to cut sex ed . that is a bad idea .
2	6B	let 's not cut the custodians either .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	football equipment .
2	6B	yeah . and if they have - if they 're using sub-par equipment that could be a public health risk .
0	6B	and then acting coaches { voc breath {
2	6B	i do n't know how necessary the coaches are - in education . because drama teachers usually -
2	6B	are not - acting coaches .
0	6B	so .
1	6B	i 'd say let 's cut funding for the acting coaches . just for a little bit and see how things do . see if there 's a complete fallout of society .
0	6B	uh .
2	6B	we do n't need to continue funding poetry books . because they have poetry books .
1	6B	yeah , let 's keep the special ed . and get rid of speech therapy .
0	6B	cooking classes
2	6B	uh . just - turn on food network .
2	6B	that is pretty different and -
1	6B	yeah . it 's pretty necessary for access .
1	6B	eh .
2	6B	let 's go ahead and axe those . no more sugar free juice machines .
1	6B	we could lump that in together with the math tutors and - keep one or the other .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	em .
2	6B	i know so many music teachers . i do n't wan na cut them .
2	6B	and it 's important .
0	6B	mm-kay . so how many have we cut from this one ?
0	6B	speech therapy .
0	6B	acting coaches , poetry books .
0	6B	the cooking classes - and the sugar free juice machines .
1	6B	we 'll see .
2	6B	reproductive education . that 's staying .
0	6B	um .
1	6B	i guess they 're kinda similar .
2	6B	well the sex ed is under education while the reproductive education is under public health .
2	6B	and that could be - also be more along the lines of like prenatal .
1	6B	trunc or not necessarily prenatal . checkups which was on there - but just -
1	6B	okay . yes . this is what you need to be doing for your baby 's health and all that . so .
2	6B	mm . we definitely do n't want an unemployed populous so .
1	6B	yeah ,
0	6B	invasive species removal .
2	6B	but i do n't think we 're necessarily cutting these things forever until the end of time . we could probably - do a trial cut for a year .
1	6B	it is important .
2	6B	i do n't think we can cross the streams , no .
2	6B	i 'm so glad you got that reference okay . uh . toxic waste disposal .
2	6B	we do n't want to be - wallowing in our own toxic waste .
0	6B	um . hospital additions .
0	6B	what are we adding ?
2	6B	i trunc i know that mine really needs a new operating suite but -
2	6B	yeah who trunc who cares about the bagel factories .
2	6B	bagel factory inspections , they can go off for a little while . hospital additions . ehm .
2	6B	they do n't need public funding , really . so we do n't really need do public funding for hospital additions so we can cut that .
2	6B	probably not because i know that needle exchange also includes uh diabetes equipment for homeless and so on and so forth .
0	6B	um .
1	6B	moon of yeah .
2	6B	yeah . it 's broken . we need to come up with something else for it .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	keep it .
0	6B	egg farm regulations .
2	6B	they 're pretty well regulated at this point .
2	6B	so we can cut that .
2	6B	let 's get rid of weed control . invasive species removal is more overarching .
1	6B	totally . well -
0	6B	um .
2	6B	i mean the prenatal check ups are pretty important .
2	6B	that would be unpleasant to the microphone .
1	6B	um . let 's see .
2	6B	uh . gosh .
2	6B	if we were to cut one then the duties that its cut will fall under the other
0	6B	and prenatal checkups are a larger -
2	6B	financial thing so we - we should probably keep that .
0	6B	and then -
0	6B	that way -
2	6B	the funding from trunc reproductive education that is n't completely cut will be funneled into that .
2	6B	there 's like no funding that really needs to go to that .
2	6B	and for the most part people do n't know their neighbors anymore anyway .
0	6B	okay . so how many do we have from there ?
0	6B	reproductive education .
0	6B	uh invasive trunc no it was the -
0	6B	hospital additions . bagel factory .
0	6B	sex offender
0	6B	egg farm .
2	6B	weed control . yay !
0	6B	we got - oh . and we got rid of - neighborhood watch so there 's seven .
1	6B	we can keep one .
0	6B	um .
2	6B	then let 's keep the reproductive education .
0	6B	alright .
2	6B	excellent . moving right along .
2	6B	i do n't wan na have a whole bunch of cats .
1	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	and then it cost money - it cost more money to put em down than to spay them .
2	6B	public news station is important . oh no !
2	6B	oh no !
2	6B	nobody watches it .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	we can come back to it .
2	6B	food bank we 're keeping .
1	6B	yeah . junior soccer league .
2	6B	i mean the y_m_c_a_ has their own and - we do n't need a county one .
0	6B	uh . kitten and puppy adoption .
2	6B	i do n't know why we have to have that publicly funded .
1	6B	yes . and no more kitten and puppy adoption
2	6B	let 's keep the soup kitchens .
1	6B	let 's keep the housing assistance .
2	6B	mm we 're not really doing anything with them . just catching em and putting em in pound
0	6B	that -
2	6B	seems rather ridiculous .
2	6B	i 'd say we get rid of the dog catcher .
1	6B	or lump it under pest control . there we go .
1	6B	yeah . no more boys basketball club .
1	6B	the public access station we can we kind of -
1	6B	combine that with the public news station .
2	6B	so we can get rid of one or the other .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	mm-kay . reusable bag campaign .
2	6B	uh do we really need to campaign over it anymore ?
2	6B	people are doing well and for the most part their keeping their plastic bags anyway . and -
2	6B	well - i 'm gon na assume that we 're - in the perfect society that has now adopted the reusable bag campaign .
2	6B	and we do n't need to campaign over it anymore .
0	6B	veterinary hospital .
2	6B	i 'd like to keep it but at the same time - publicly funded -
1	6B	yeah . football stadium upkeep .
2	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	so we 've - we 're getting rid of the public news station -
0	6B	the junior soccer league -
0	6B	adoption -
0	6B	dog catcher -
0	6B	basketball -
0	6B	reusable bag campaign .
2	6B	so we can keep the -
2	6B	no , let 's keep the veterinary hospital .
1	6B	nn-yeah .
1	6B	let 's go ahead and keep the adoption .
2	6B	because i really do n't care about that football stadium .
2	6B	it 's not bringing in any money and -
1	6B	exactly .
0	6B	alright .
0	6B	okay .
0	6B	infrastructure and licensing .
2	6B	oh god keep the teaching certificates .
2	6B	everyone speeds anyway and do n't we already have them up there ? are they trunc do we have to pay rent for having them ?
2	6B	i mean , people are n't stealing them , are they ?
2	6B	so we 'll get rid of the speed limit signs .
2	6B	yeah . so let 's just keep - let 's get rid of the additional bus stops .
2	6B	yeah let 's keep licensing them .
2	6B	yeah we 'll keep the licenses . so we 'll also keep the boating license .
2	6B	yes let pothole maintenance is necessary .
0	6B	subway system .
2	6B	kind of - it 's a subway for like a mile and a half .
0	6B	yeah . that 's true .
2	6B	yeah we need to keep funding it until it 's done . because a half done one is n't gon na do anything .
2	6B	so we 'll keep the subway system for now .
0	6B	hunting tags .
2	6B	i mean every time someone gets a license they are paying for it .
2	6B	so that 's a source of income . so let 's keep that .
2	6B	towing services should be privatized .
0	6B	so -
2	6B	yeah . so no more towing services .
1	6B	um . massage certificate . that 's another certification .
3	6B	how many flag poles -
3	6B	do we have in this city that we need to have a flag pole repair department ?
3	6B	how many people are we putting out of a job if we cut that ? like one his name is larry and he works part time . i think trunc it 's okay if we get rid of the flag pole repair .
2	6B	i have never heard of a taxi stop .
2	6B	i 'm standing outside the grocery store . i 'm gon na call a taxi .
3	6B	let 's get rid of the taxi stops .
3	6B	or at least stop funding them .
