1	6B	pretty infrequent thing . but you never know , maybe not .
0	6B	alright . let 's see . so we have two for sure , maybe three under that one .
2	6B	they all look good .

2	6B	public news station . that 's a good thing .
0	6B	has to be the -
2	6B	well you got ta - i would trunc i 'd say you 'd have to do at least two .

1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	okay . i 'm still under public service - you take out the soup kitchen .
2	6B	because it 's done by faith based groups .
1	6B	they 'll do it anyway .
1	6B	and they 're
1	6B	reusable bags .
1	6B	those are easy . okay .
1	6B	public health and safety . trunc you wan na go to education next ?
1	6B	right .

0	6B	all over .
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	okay . we 'll leave reproductive .
0	6B	um . in under public health .
0	6B	they 're more talking about s_t_d_ but -
1	6B	weed control can go . do n't you think ?
2	6B	well i 'm having trouble with reproductive and sexually transmitted . one or the other .
2	6B	and i say sexually transmitted . because it should be under the other one .
2	6B	i dunno .
2	6B	no , it is n't .
1	6B	but let 's go with uh -
1	6B	reproductive education .
2	6B	i do n't know .
2	6B	it 's real important for public health though .
2	6B	i 'm - i 'm just seeing a duplicate in trunc uh - sexually transmitted diseases and reproductive education . whoops .
1	6B	maybe we 're not fast enough .
0	6B	uh .
1	6B	they 're sorta the same .
2	6B	okay . sexually transmitted disease education . gone . although under public health you know what they do .
0	6B	they give tests to people . and if they come up positive for something there 's a whole army of these little - public health cars that park in my parking garage .
0	6B	and they have to say well -
0	6B	to whom may you have spread this disease ?
0	6B	then they get a list . and they go out and knock on the door . say how do you do ?
0	6B	it 's best you come to the public health department and be tested .
0	6B	and treated .
0	6B	and um -
2	6B	that 's not education though .
2	6B	it 's - public health .
1	6B	i guess it 's education when they find them .
2	6B	i say remove reproductive education . and we 'll call it sex ed under the education .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	and reproductive education and the weed control .
1	6B	is that okay with you , cynthia ?
2	6B	because we 're going to get sex ed -
1	6B	anyway .
1	6B	right .
1	6B	and weeds - well weeds - generally do n't kill people . sometimes controlling them kills people .
0	6B	right . so now we have two -
0	6B	to go on education .
0	6B	what 's an acting coach ?
0	6B	i dunno .
2	6B	cooking classes . is gone .
1	6B	yep .

1	6B	but we 're keeping poetry books , right ?
2	6B	they 're in the library . they 're in the library .
2	6B	so i would say we 're removing -
2	6B	poetry books . i love poetry but we 're removing that and what 's the other thing ? cooking classes .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	the cooking , you know , helps people know what 's healthy but -

1	6B	and weed control .
1	6B	the next one we agreed on -
0	6B	yeah .
2	6B	what - trunc i 'll tell you what they 're thinking about . they 're thinking about certificates of need for hospital beds .
2	6B	that 's what they 're thinking .
1	6B	well , it just is there . now if we were to find two under recreation and public services . we were there once .
 1	6B	dog catcher was gone .
1	6B	and reusable bags .
0	6B	okay .
0	6B	and infrastructure ?
2	6B	no that 's important .
1	6B	they were all trunc additional bus stops . we were -
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	alright that 's our trunc our - our final answer there valerie .
0	6B	um .
1	6B	okay . we 're not done yet valerie .
0	6B	alright . um .
3	6B	well , you know , you have a good point because it could be - preventing pregnancies .
3	6B	and that has a disastrous effect - on teenagers . disastrous .
2	6B	maybe that needs to be in there .
0	6B	and uh -
0	6B	kudzu .
0	6B	okay .
2	6B	why do n't we - alright . we 're changing our mind . invasive species removal and weed control .
2	6B	there you go . that 's putting the humans first . thank you cynthia .
1	6B	alright . so here we go .
0	6B	uh . we eliminated on the first one -
2	6B	alright . that 's our final answer . poetry books and sugar free juice machines .
1	6B	on the second thing , our final answer is invasive species removal -
1	6B	weed control .
1	6B	and our third thing we came up with was - was it dog catcher ?
1	6B	dog catcher and reusable bag campaign .
0	6B	and on the fourth one we came up with -
1	6B	additional bus stops -
1	6B	and taxi stops .
1	6B	we 're done .
2	6B	that was hard .
2	6B	well i think it 's better to just take a five percent cut across the board and let everybody , you know , cut the fat outta their own department . but - the - we 'll go with this .
