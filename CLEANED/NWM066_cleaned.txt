0	6B	ah , yeah .
0	6B	mm .
1	6B	yeah , i would trunc i agree . i agree . i think those are nice , but it 's not something you really - i mean all these other things need it - need it more if we use that . yeah .
0	6B	yeah .
0	6B	mm .
1	6B	oh , we try for three .
1	6B	see if that goes . then if we ca n't handle that we 'll just - yeah . yeah .
1	6B	absolutely . we know that 's true .
2	6B	yeah , i think that 's true because there are any number of sources for that money . um .
2	6B	although you do n't wan na go to those sources . there they are .
1	6B	and , um . i also think that , um -
1	6B	uh , i was gon na say cooking classes . but that 's i guess that 's actually really useful stuff . i - i grew up with that and , i mean , our high school had home ec . yeah .
1	6B	yeah that 's it . yeah . yeah , yeah . you 're right .
1	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	so maybe it 's the assistant cooks .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	yeah . this is interesting because we 're uh - volunteering at our neighborhood elementary school . you can see all this stuff , going into the big public - big public , you know elementary school . it 's really fun . i mean , bookkeeping classes . that 's a real skill . i just -
1	6B	i do n't - like , it sounds more like a - it sounds like a high school class , or trunc well , i guess you just do n't fund it cuz you 'd have to get someone .
1	6B	you could , yeah . yeah . uh .
0	6B	sugar . football equipment .
1	6B	yeah . okay . so we did three . we did three . okay . alright .

1	6B	mh-hm .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	why do we need to inspect bagel factories ?
0	6B	is there some particular reason why bagel factories in particular are being singled out for being cut ? it 's jus-
2	6B	yeah , but it does n't - i mean bakeries are bakeries and , you know they - they do n't -
0	6B	they get trunc they get the regular , um , health inspection .
0	6B	trunc really ? says bagel ? huh . huh .
0	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah . yeah . trunc yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .

1	6B	neighbors do it anyway .
1	6B	okay , so we got one .
1	6B	uh , bagels . that 's two .
0	6B	hm .
2	6B	additions . i would , too . yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
2	6B	yeah , right . they 've just , they 've got a big one . yeah . well , it means , yeah , it means they have to go to private sources instead of government .
2	6B	but , i think not building a wing in a hospital is -
2	6B	trunc uh - is - is - i mean , trunc that 's okay compared to removing some of these other things . i mean , it 's really - yeah .
1	6B	yeah , yeah . mm-kay we did three there . three there . okay . oh .
0	6B	hm .
0	6B	um , i 'm wondering if - public news station . i 'm wondering if it 's like the thing - the trunc someone was reminding me of this yesterday that seattle had this thing that was an open station . do you remember that on television ? on cable ? and anybody could sign up . and you had all these wackos that were there doing half hour shows . um . i do n't - yes . yes . i do n't know if , um , that 's what it means .

1	6B	yeah . yeah .
1	6B	yeah , right .
2	6B	yeah . it 's actually a huge service .

2	6B	yeah , yeah , yeah . junior soccer league sounds co-ed . yeah . uh , but boys ' basketball club does not .
0	6B	and .
0	6B	uh , what 'd we say ? trunc oh , the public access station and the boys ' basketball club .
0	6B	reuse .

1	6B	that 's interesting . okay . yeah . yeah . okay . we 've got - we 've got three . yeah . we did it .
1	6B	yeah . oh , boy .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	yeah .
1	6B	that might be the money for building them . or planning them . yeah .
2	6B	yeah . way . way down . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah .

0	6B	mm .
1	6B	yeah , that means that , yeah . they keep knocking them down and trunc stuff .
2	6B	well , i do n't trunc i would take - that 's one of my first candidates . it really is . because taxi stops , uh , exist in places , and they 're useful . but nobody trunc i mean , we 're talking about seattle . they do n't really get used . i mean , in some places . there 's huge lines for them in airports . you have a specialized - but the airport runs that .
1	6B	yeah . yeah . taxi stops .
