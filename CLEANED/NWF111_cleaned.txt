2	3I	oh , just one at a time ! one at a time . they said one at a time .
2	3I	so here , stick those back in here .
2	3I	just pick one at a time .
1	3I	i do n't know . that 's - that 's how i read the rules , anyway .
1	3I	okay . alright . just pull one out .
2	3I	okay , well - it looks we have better organization than we did on our lists . so -
1	3I	do you think we should group the foods together ? should we put the preserve foods differently from the fresh foods ?
1	3I	you know , these are -
2	3I	these are groceries . there 's definitely groceries .
0	3I	mm-hm .
2	3I	yeah , they 're probably dried , would be my guess .
1	3I	yeah , that looks like a good choice to me .
1	3I	okay . alright .
2	3I	fish hooks , that looks like it would probably go pretty much right there .
1	3I	with the boating supplies .
1	3I	thick sweaters . oh , we get to pick that ourselves .
1	3I	should we put clothes in the middle ?
0	3I	okay , toys -
1	3I	well , there was paper and scissors that could maybe be grouped with that .
1	3I	um , so these are sorta more sundries , i think ?
1	3I	so yeah , maybe h-
1	3I	we have bathroom supplies , that kinda stuff . so that could go here , mm-hm .
1	3I	so we 'll put the clothes here , sort of opposite some of the travel stuff ?
0	3I	okay .
1	3I	no .
1	3I	mm-kay , electric heaters .
1	3I	so that 's kind of household items , maybe ?
1	3I	maybe could go on this side with the mousetraps ?
1	3I	these are more sporting and hardware , perhaps ?
1	3I	what do you think ?
1	3I	mm-kay , we 'll try that .
1	3I	yeah , yeah sure ! yeah , kinda house -
1	3I	care , garden care -
1	3I	sorts of stuff . empty plastic jugs . that looks like we need a recycling bin , but we do n't have one .
1	3I	okay , so that 's gon na be i would think with -
1	3I	would that be more of a sport thing or more of up with the refrigerator magnets ? this would be , like -
2	3I	you know , just for carrying around a drink . no , we have to do this one .
2	3I	i 'll put it up here with the empty plastic bags with refrigerator magnets .
1	3I	mm - mm-kay .
1	3I	yeah .
1	3I	i think so . unless we go with electric heaters , but that 's more appliances . this is more -
0	3I	do it yourself .
1	3I	liters of water . how bout that ? would that go near the plastic jugs ? or do you think it would go -
1	3I	in the refrigerated unit ?
1	3I	they do n't have to be refrigerated .
0	3I	they have thrown some things in here that were not on our list .
1	3I	okay .
0	3I	mm-hm .
1	3I	so should we put that in this group ?
1	3I	okay .
1	3I	okay , trunc yeah , maybe we 'll have something else we wan na stick in there .
0	3I	small axes .

1	3I	maybe closer to the toys .
1	3I	so maybe in this section where the clothes are trunc forming up ?
1	3I	we had boots and stuff , too , and they 're gon na probably end up in there .
0	3I	sticks of butter .
1	3I	over here ?
1	3I	yeah . that 's the refrigerated stuff .
1	3I	bars of soap . okay , rolls of duct tape .

1	3I	running out of space around some of these columns
0	3I	backpacks .
0	3I	light jackets ?
0	3I	small saws .

1	3I	over here , maybe ?
0	3I	yeah .

1	3I	pouches of oatmeal . i think that would go in this section here .
0	3I	boxes of doughnuts .
2	3I	let 's - let 's change this . let 's put the - this one down here by the pet food .
0	3I	okay . flags .
1	3I	books of matches . maybe that goes in this section too . you think ? yeah .
0	3I	wetsuits .
1	3I	yeah , that could go back to back with the boating supplies .
0	3I	and books .
0	3I	tow ropes .
2	3I	well , we 're pretty low in the food department .
2	3I	we 're done !
0	3I	yeah , and refrigerated items -
0	3I	non-refrigerated food items , toiletries , trunc clothing type stuff .
2	3I	backpacks could be moved , but , you know , that 's probably okay there .
0	3I	office-y stuff and kid toys , wetsuits , books -
0	3I	household sort-of equipment-y things -
2	3I	and then all the sporting and outdoor and hardware stuff . yeah ! i think we 've got it .
2	3I	i think we have a much better store than we started out with .
1	3I	we 're all in agreement on that .
0	6B	reproductive education .
1	6B	okay , so if we trunc a_ , we have to cut equal numbers from each one , so -
1	6B	football equipment .
1	6B	acting coaches .
2	6B	i think we might need those .
1	6B	sugar-free -
1	6B	i - we had talked about cutting the classes , and i do n't know whether we wan na stick with that idea or not .
1	6B	so , if we - if we cut sex ed here -
0	6B	and -
1	6B	football equipment ?
1	6B	acting coaches .
1	6B	um , and sugar-free machines . that 's four .
1	6B	so let 's see if four ends up being a good number for all of them .
2	6B	keeping reproductive education .
2	6B	are we cancelling it ?
2	6B	well yeah , but trunc i 'm not sure we can -
1	6B	do we get to plan that ? we have to -
2	6B	maybe that 's our thinking . maybe that 's our thinking .
1	6B	okay .
2	6B	okay , so there 's one , and reproductive education we 're keeping . let 's see , which one did we decide - ? so , if we 're cutting s_t_d_ education -
2	6B	yeah , can we get rid of four things ? oh , hospital additions we were gon na cut .
1	6B	uh , i do n't know . can we get rid of weed control ?
1	6B	then we can get rid of weed control . so we need one more , if we 're gon na do four .
1	6B	yeah , you could certainly be -
1	6B	uh , we figured we should keep all that .
0	6B	okay , well we 've got three so far from this group .
0	6B	uh -
1	6B	well , maybe three . maybe we only end up being able to cut three.1
0	6B	spaying .
1	6B	reusable bag campaign ?
1	6B	well , okay . so um -
2	6B	so that - boy , i really hate cutting that - the -
2	6B	effort to support people trunc by providing the food bank . i just -
2	6B	food bank or soup kitchen .
2	6B	one of those two things i think the county should keep .
1	6B	cuz we 've got housing assistance , so which is more valuable ? the soup kitchens are sorta for the homeless people more so , and the food bank is more for people who have a place to cook .
0	6B	um .
2	6B	so , maybe the soup kitchen is more of a county function , cuz there 's public health involved with that , whereas with the food bank you 're handing out packaged things .
1	6B	so maybe we can let a non-profit take over the food bank .
1	6B	keep the trunc keep the soup kitchen .
0	6B	um .
1	6B	but get rid of - which one did you suggest , the public news station ?
0	6B	public news station -
0	6B	and food bank .
1	6B	um , did we also say the adoptions ?
0	6B	or -
0	6B	outsourcing that .
0	6B	okay .
0	6B	dog catcher . so there 's three things right there .
2	6B	pest control we need , veterinary hospital i suppose we need .
0	6B	uh , football stadium upkeep -
1	6B	so the reusable bag campaign -
1	6B	i mean , that is good for the environmental issues that it brings up okay , so we 've got -
0	6B	three , three for that .
0	6B	okay , infrastructure and licensing .
1	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	and the taxi stops .
2	6B	so , there 's three in each category except this we had four , so we can add one back in .
0	6B	so , let 's see , assistant cooks , sex ed , -
1	6B	we could trunc keep the sugar-free juice machines .
0	6B	um , let 's see , which ones did we decide to get rid of ? we got rid of the sex ed -
0	6B	and was it the football equipment ?
0	6B	and the acting coaches .
2	6B	trunc yeah , we - okay , so we - we did n't make that choice .
1	6B	mm-hm .
2	6B	football equipment ? does the county need to provide that ?
2	6B	not so sure . it 's also -
1	6B	well that could also be girls and boys , whereas this is - football 's just boys .
0	6B	so .
1	6B	so , sex ed , football equipment -
1	6B	mm , the acting coaches we thought were maybe optional .
1	6B	and the sugar-free juice machines , we keep that for - for their health purposes , and get rid of the acting coaches ?
1	6B	you like coke , do you ?
1	6B	so , should we knock that one out ? that 's not a county cost , anyway .
2	6B	so then we 're down to three . so then we keep the coach .
1	6B	the acting coach .
0	6B	okay , so we 're down to three in each category then .
0	6B	i wonder how much money we 're saving the county ?
1	6B	i think we - we made our decision about it .
2	6B	no , they just said we had to do the same number .
0	6B	mm-hm .
1	6B	maybe we 're supposed to discuss each item . we did n't discuss each item in absolute detail like we did over there . i mean - you know , there were things -
1	6B	like , the neighborhood watch support we thought was valuable for -
0	6B	everything pre-natal checkups is something , you know , for public health .
0	6B	i thought i heard the door .
1	6B	uh , regulations . we need that .
1	6B	we have to support the veterans .
2	6B	sex offender database . needle exchange , really important for public health . and the inspections are important .
1	6B	right .
1	6B	right . toxic waste disposal 's really important .
1	6B	we decided s_t_d_ education could be grouped in with reproductive education , right ?
1	6B	uh , we 're gon na keep the invasive species removal and the vaccinations , job training programs , and reproductive education .
0	6B	uh , i think we discussed everything under public , uh , services .
0	6B	and we decided what to keep and what not to keep on there . um -
0	6B	this one we did n't go through in detail , infrastructure and licensing . we decided to keep the teaching certificates .
0	6B	all the public safety signage not increase the bus stops -
0	6B	we decided to keep the licensing as well . tattoo artist , boating licenses .
2	6B	keep the standards high . pothole maintenance , subway , of course . hunting tags are important . towing services are important . certificates for massage .
2	6B	flagpole repair , not so important . taxi stops , not so important
2	6B	fishing licenses , keeping the buses up , and keeping the drainage ditches in good repair , that all seems very -
2	6B	important .
1	6B	yep .
0	6B	yep .
0	6B	um .
0	6B	is there anything we missed ?
0	6B	education programs -
0	6B	um .
1	6B	notetakers for disability services . that 's the only thing there is for disability , so -
1	6B	in the whole list , so definitely need to -
1	6B	serve their needs .
2	6B	well good !
2	6B	i think we 've got a plan .
0	6B	i do n't know .
1	6B	maybe we were n't clear trunc were we clear enough ?
