1	6B	taxi stops .
2	6B	i would think you could get rid of the - of taxi stops .
1	6B	oh yeah . specially in bad weather .
0	6B	that would be like a license i would think .
1	6B	everything trunc helps -
1	6B	i thought maybe the taxi stops .
0	6B	and -
1	6B	the bus stops .
1	6B	can be fewer and farther between .
2	6B	uh . we ca n't get rid of the subway system that we do n't have . we can not get rid of wish we had one .

2	6B	definitely keep trunc stray cat spaying .
2	6B	and public news station .
1	6B	and the food bank .
1	6B	what would you get rid of ?
1	6B	uh . if you had to get rid of something maybe reusable bag campaign .
1	6B	i mean it 's important but hopefully people are -
1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	uh .
0	6B	where ?
1	6B	oh yes .
1	6B	how many do we have to get rid of ? why do n't we just get rid of one outta each one call it the budget . did they say how many we have to do ?
0	6B	where do you see that ?
0	6B	oh .
0	6B	oh .
0	6B	mm .
2	6B	cause that could go private .
2	6B	yeah . you got ta -
2	6B	cuz they 'll just breed more stray cats .
2	6B	that sorta trunc goes along - i think the veterinary hospital - i wonder if that is the same thing as like paws or something .
0	6B	or -
0	6B	you know , where do they - ?
1	6B	well the police do the dog catching , do n't they ?
1	6B	do n't they have a department ? i do n't know .

0	6B	the news .
2	6B	oh wait til we get to public safety .
2	6B	now there 's two things here . education , sex ed and reproductive education . you could take one outta one of those lists .
0	6B	job training programs . it 's chicken pox vaccinations .
0	6B	invasive species removal .
0	6B	that 's like -
2	6B	they 'll do it anyway .

1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	um .
1	6B	oh . it does n't matter ?
1	6B	we might as well just go on down to public health too .
0	6B	um .
1	6B	but we can choose - here or there .
1	6B	um . i would think this one .
2	6B	or to remove ? or to remove that one ? cuz they 're sorta the same thing . this is - this is like -
0	6B	in highschool , right ? and this is like planned parenthood .
0	6B	mm .
2	6B	job training programs should stay . chicken pox vaccinations should -
1	6B	well that could be trunc well .

1	6B	yeah .
0	6B	um .
2	6B	well they 're sorta the same th-
2	6B	department . i mean they 'd be done in the same place i would think . or else this and this would be the same place .

1	6B	are sorta -
1	6B	together
0	6B	mm-hm .
0	6B	wow .
