2	6B	something in a certain field . sex ed is important . custodians are important . 
0	6B	is - 
1	6B	yeah .

1	6B	okay , well - 
1	6B	wait . okay . well , trunc yeah , okay . so poetry books - i guess poetry's important . 
2	6B	so we can keep that . special ed teachers , i think are necessary definitely . 
0	6B	cooking classes . 
0	6B	well , trunc how is that different from assistant cooks ? 
0	6B	i don't even know what assistant cooks means in education and programs . 
1	6B	right .

1	6B	i - i dunno . 
0	6B	book keeping as in like filing stuff ? and - ? 
1	6B	i guess . yeah , that 's probably important then . yeah . 
2	6B	you shouldn't cut  them . 
2	6B	trunc yeah ! keep that . 
2	6B	well for sure - okay , my top choice for cutting it is the juice - machines . 
1	6B	okay . 
2	6B	sure , well we 'll see what we wanna cut from here . 
1	6B	one , two , okay so . public health and safety , reproductive education . it's like - which is like sex ed . 
0	6B	reproductive education . 
0	6B	i don't - 
2	6B	that could trunc be taken away maybe , yeah . 
2	6B	that 's important . 
2	6B	that 's important . 
0	6B	invasive species . 
2	6B	 i think it's important . coming from someone that 's taken environmental classes . like , i dunno . i wouldn't take that away . mm . 
2	6B	s_t_d_ trunc well , it's - there 's like all these like branches of sexual education . just like - s_ - 
1	6B	no , we can't . 
2	6B	apparently . that 's the way they 're making it look . 
1	6B	that 's important . hospital additions . 
1	6B	yes . 
0	6B	needle exchange . what does that mean ? 
0	6B	like - 
0	6B	oh . 
0	6B	i don't either . 
2	6B	it - trunc yeah . we shouldn't cut it if we don't know what it is . so . we 'll just keep that . sex offender database is probably important as well . 
0	6B	medical assistance 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	people can pull their own weeds . well like what , in like public - places ? you have like - 
1	6B	oh . i dunno . 
1	6B	someone takes care of it . 
0	6B	it's the weed trunc 
2	6B	maybe that 's actually important . 
2	6B	i don't - mm , cuz like . well - i don't actually - and i mean if it like - 
1	6B	if it's like trunc like - 
1	6B	hurting likenative plants . then - 
1	6B	then , you shouldn't have weeds . i mean but like if it's just like weeds like dandelions in a field - like - you can leave those , you know ? 
1	6B	i dunno , we 'll leave it for now . pre-natal check-ups . 
0	6B	what's - ? 
1	6B	i guess . it's - it's a safety thing . 
1	6B	that 's - yeah . 
1	6B	yes . so . 
1	6B	since we have sex ed . yeah , okay . sure . just both of them ? okay , cool . recreation and public services . stray cat spaying . that is probably actually good . because cats - 
0	6B	like - 
2	6B	they reproduce really - a lot . 
2	6B	i dunno , i 've like - i went to turkey . full of cats . 
2	6B	so many cats , yeah . they were cute , but i was like - v- 
2	6B	yeah ! just like so many cats . it was - crazy . anyway so yeah it's important . we should keep that . 
2	6B	community news ads . i hate ads . so . well , if it - unless - 
1	6B	i dunno . 
1	6B	community news ads ? like , does that mean like it's like it's advertising things like happening in the community ? cuz then that could be cool to keep . but if it's like advertising like - 
2	6B	so let's keep it for now . the foodbank you should keep that . that 's good stuff . soccer league . can't - i can't take that from the kids . trunc 
2	6B	oh my gosh . how can you say no to that ? how can you get rid of that ? definitely . 
2	6B	that 's - that 's good . it like feeds - 
2	6B	you know , well food bank - food bank and soup kitchen trunc are different . you know ? 
0	6B	food banks are for people for like - 
2	6B	you know , who i think - you know , they have a home , yeah but - those are for straight up homeless people . so that 's important . housing assistance . 
0	6B	like what does that mean ? like - ? 
0	6B	help you find a house . it's just you at your house . 
0	6B	mm-hm . 
1	6B	yeah .

1	6B	okay . 
1	6B	sure . 
1	6B	we 'll see - 
0	6B	i dunno . 
2	6B	this one's harder to cut things from .

2	6B	pest control . well , no that 's like - that 's like rodents and stuff . 
1	6B	in your house . uh . so , what are we cutting ? 
0	6B	i guess . 
1	6B	uh , these two ? 
2	6B	well - you just said that those like just be 
1	6B	oh . okay . never mind then . maybe community news ads . 
2	6B	if they wanna have ads they can do it themselves . we 're not gonna pay for it , i guess . and . 
1	6B	okay . 
1	6B	alright . sure . 
0	6B	okay . 
2	6B	teaching certificates . uh , i think we should have teachers . so . we should probably have that . you said no speed limit signs , that could be cut . trunc trunc why ? just like - yeah , no that - that should be kept probably . 
0	6B	additional bus stops . 
2	6B	i trunc well , now that i 'm using the bus system . 
1	6B	i kinda like that personally . but you know maybe that could be cut if like there 's something else - tattoo artist licenses . 
2	6B	trunc trunc uh , why - do we - ? 
2	6B	do - does the government seriously like fund that ? like what - ? 
2	6B	that 's so random . yeah , i feel like - why would we - ? 
2	6B	well , i don't care about tattoos . but i know people do . 
1	6B	i dunno . we 'll - 
1	6B	we 'll think about it . boating . we should let them boat . 
2	6B	no , we trunc we should keep that . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	especially trunc if this is seattle . i dunno where we are living here but - 
0	6B	oh . 
2	6B	well - 
0	6B	oh . 
0	6B	it doesn't mean like we 're issuing it ? 
0	6B	okay . 
2	6B	whatever . yeah ! potholes . that 's important . um . subway system . 
2	6B	you can live without out . i dunno . it's good . well , but like how trunc how do you cut a whole subway system if you have it already ? that doesn't make sense . we 're just gonna rip it out of the ground , guys . 
2	6B	cuz that 's not gonna cost money . no , we should just keep it . 
3	6B	animals . uh . see , i don't trunc i feel like i don't feel like have the authority to like cut things . cuz like i don't care about hunting or tattoos . but , like people trunc i know . but like - it's like people do those things . but like - i dunno . 
2	6B	trunc can a taxi trunc taxis can stop wherever it wants , can't it ? 
0	6B	oh , really ? 
2	6B	well i guess you should keep that . cuz people use taxis . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	that 's true . 
0	6B	that- 
1	6B	i feel like is - you should keep . 
2	6B	yeah , cuz - safety . drainage . all these are like - 
2	6B	yeah , those are important to . so i guess if anything we 'd have to cut like licenses . cuz everything is like important , you know ? 
2	6B	sorry , people . tattoo , uh - okay i think tattoo is like - 
2	6B	i dunno . 
2	6B	it's not necessary . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	if you 're hardcore enough to get a tattoo then , who cares if you know you get one without a trunc like a licensed person . i dunno . yeah . 
2	6B	well , yeah . 
2	6B	they can go to a different city and get their tattoo done . 
2	6B	we 're taking that off . and um - 
2	6B	they can take the bus or they can take the subway . so , okay , sure . tattoo and taxi . yes , we 're done . we are finished .
