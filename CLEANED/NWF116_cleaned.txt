1	3I	food . 
1	3I	i think . travel guides . 
2	3I	oh . do you wanna do that ? oh that 's a good idea . 
0	3I	and we used to like playing trunc you know , where you can only like - 
1	3I	one at a time but we don't have that uh - 
0	3I	oh . 
0	3I	backpacks . 
0	3I	trunc packages of cookies .

0	3I	is there a backpack somewhere ? 
1	3I	fish hooks . yes ! fish hooks . 
0	3I	bags of peat moss . 
1	3I	i 'm trunc we may have a few of those like okay that just in - 
0	3I	flags . 
1	3I	trunc oh , that 's - small saw . there we go . 
0	3I	pre-cut wood . matches . 
0	3I	ah , small axes . we - 
1	3I	mm-hm . and knives too , box knives . 
0	3I	look - 
2	3I	oh . see - trunc that 's very - i think that 's a - yeah - just and what's so interesting is the gender thing . how tweezers you see as a small tool , i 'm like - 
2	3I	i 'm trunc no trunc it's a toiletry thing , it's for plucking your eyebrows . isn't that funny ? 
1	3I	mm . yeah . box knives . i would think . 
1	3I	tee and half inch tubing - and duct tape - i would think like heavy cable - 
1	3I	yeah and peat - moss is sort of - 
1	3I	i - this seems like a total outlier . and flags . i 'm just as general hardware , right ? 
1	3I	trunc yeah . yeah . 
1	3I	electric heater . you need that to heat up after your wetsuit . paper bags and large - or there - are there other like - um - 
1	3I	or just carrying . trunc household . 
1	3I	well canvas bags - 
1	3I	so it's kinda like in this little - loose leaf paper , maybe books . 
1	3I	oh . cook stove . that goes - see this is like camping stuff , right ? camping-ish 
0	3I	okay . 
0	3I	okay . 
1	3I	ah , yeah . backpack there . 
1	3I	mm-hm . 
1	3I	either one . camping . 
1	3I	they 're in our camping thing . 
0	3I	but - but - 
1	3I	empty plastic jugs for camping ? car camping . uh - un - er - fishing i guess . if you go - 
0	3I	when - 
0	3I	yeah . 
0	3I	cushions for deck chairs . 
1	3I	uh . it's kinda this whole sort of - i think - you think ? mm-kay . 
1	3I	oh . and the five pound weights . where 'd ye gonna work out ? yeah . that 's - 
1	3I	nn-yeah . 
1	3I	okay . 
1	3I	what about food - stuff ? 
0	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	and this is all - like - clothing stuff , yeah ? okay . 
1	3I	yeah . mm-hm . 
1	3I	ingredients versus or - or ingredients versus already made . yeah . 
1	3I	either - uh . 
1	3I	yeah . and i just wanted to check and make sure that - yes . this is good so we still have all the - 
1	3I	uh-huh . 
0	3I	sugar , ice cream , cake mix , and eggs . 
0	3I	okay . 
2	3I	sugar's trunc like a main staple . 
0	3I	um . 
1	3I	that is - it's a weird thing . 
0	3I	sticks of butter . 
1	3I	see i immediately go to , okay what does it take to m- 
0	3I	the thing is - is you have cake mix . 
1	3I	i would have the trunc you don't need to put sugar in cake mix , right ? cuz it's already in there . 
2	3I	so i would look so - trunc right here there 's - this looks like baking stuff to me . but i normally would have sugar in the baking stuff but i 'm not allowed to . 
1	3I	i would think so . 
2	3I	oh . we 'll just do that . but here - here - 
1	3I	oh . it's the aisle , right ? so - 
1	3I	is this ? 
2	3I	no . that 's - that 's like - is this walking down the aisle and down the left you have the sugar and on the right you have ice cream ? 
2	3I	yeah - but then eggs and butter are by each other in the store . 
2	3I	maybe it should be down here . 
1	3I	okay . 
1	3I	do you want all the food first ? the easy seems like - easiest - 
1	3I	okay . mm . 
1	3I	yeah . i 'm going to have - oops - ice cream . 
1	3I	trunc yeah . 
1	3I	like that ? 
0	3I	like - 
2	3I	you 'd have doughnuts on one side of the aisle and cookies on the other . this is my virgo . or would they be all like - 
2	3I	over here . 
1	3I	cuz that 's - that 's an a - 
1	3I	that 's gonna be in the - 
3	3I	this is just think - my brain this is - in a trunc i know ! this is in a freezer ! 
1	3I	we don't have to be - 
1	3I	i think we should put the whisky next to the - ice cream . 
2	3I	yes ! yes . is it ? 
1	3I	really ? 
0	3I	ah . 
0	3I	whisky and ice cream . 
0	3I	okay . 
0	3I	uh . 
0	3I	and then - 
1	3I	well let's just - okay , so we 've got - 
1	3I	that 's like a - 
0	3I	um . 
0	3I	a trunc what do i call it ? 
0	3I	a trunc yeah . thank you . an ingredient as opposed to something that 's already - 
1	3I	as a processed item . but still . 
1	3I	it doesn't really matter . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	mm-kay . 
1	3I	do these things just - ? 
1	3I	go down here then . 
0	3I	peas and soy beans . 
1	3I	yay . 
0	3I	and - 
0	3I	figs . 
1	3I	they can just - 
2	3I	there 's something else that should be there . nother legume that we don't have . 
1	3I	well like - oh wait . you were saying whisky and the ice cream , right ? 
1	3I	we can make this store however we want it , right ? 
2	3I	oh god . yeah . that would be - there . 
1	3I	looks nice , see . 
1	3I	can't help it . 
0	3I	i have - 
0	3I	even - 
1	3I	you can go ahead and rearrange that all if you choose . 
2	3I	hey . 
2	3I	an actual - 
0	3I	and a travel guide trunc boating supplies - 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	yep . i think so . 
0	3I	kay . 
1	3I	and small saws in case you wanna sink your boat . cuz you can - 
1	3I	fishing net , fish hooks , and wetsuits . 
1	3I	kay . 
0	3I	power cords . 
0	3I	mm . 
1	3I	i think so . 
1	3I	see - um - i think - 
1	3I	i mean - i would think all this stuff could just go down - 
1	3I	here . you know . 
1	3I	siding , mouse traps , power cords , and . 
1	3I	what do you think ? 
1	3I	sure . yeah . kinda small - 
0	3I	small - 
0	3I	things . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	trunc do you think ? 
1	3I	all the stuff's just kinda all - it's just the - yeah - oh . a tow rope though . that 's - that 's boating . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	but like power cord and heavy cable - 
1	3I	roles of duct tape . 
0	3I	half inch tubing . 
1	3I	i think the five pound weights should go - oh wait . electric heater . 
1	3I	guess the power cords . 
0	3I	then - 
1	3I	of course you need your five pound weights between your scissors and your duct tape . 
0	3I	half inch tubing , bags of peat moss . 
0	3I	buckets . 
1	3I	with the - yeah . 
1	3I	okay . 
1	3I	it is . 
1	3I	toys , refrigerator magnets , toilet paper , ah-ha . that 's kind of - that 's either a paper good or a toiletry but i think - yeah . 
1	3I	yeah . 
0	3I	hm . 
1	3I	i think since we got a lotta clothes - we may need to put the clothes - in between the toys and the pet food . 
1	3I	i don't see anything wrong with that . 
1	3I	it's our it's our store we could put the whisky by the - 
1	3I	pet food . 
1	3I	yeah . refrigerator magnets . 
0	3I	most - i act - and just thinking of the store . t_n_c_ in bainbridge - you know , you 've got the pet food - 
1	3I	and kinda like - the cups and the paper bags and stuff on one - you think ? 
1	3I	and canvas bag . think ? 
1	3I	if it works for thenakatas , yes . 
0	3I	okay . 
1	3I	yeah . i 'd trunc like yeah . 
1	3I	i - trunc i 'd see - we could have clothes here . and then the rest of the - 
1	3I	other bundles of trunc ticks and wood 
1	3I	travel guides , mouse trunc kinda here ? or ? 
1	3I	k- 
1	3I	backpack could go over there , yeah . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	maybe the empty plastic jugs and the buckets by the - well these are - i 'm think - yeah i was like - is this - are these the like - 
0	3I	welcome to seattle magnets or - you know the - industrial - 
0	3I	no frills ones . 
1	3I	cuz then we could put the - 
1	3I	empty plastic jugs and buckets by em maybe . 
1	3I	mm-hm . 
1	3I	mm-hm . 
1	3I	you think those two by the - 
1	3I	small axes , small saws . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	yeah . 
0	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	yeah . 
1	3I	yeah . okay . 
1	3I	oh socks and shoe laces and boots . 
1	3I	hat and backpack maybe ? 
1	3I	large sweaters - i mean large vests and thick sweaters and light jackets . 
1	3I	and - ah , heavy coats . 
1	3I	oh , i don't know which one this goes on someone's back . 
0	3I	hm . 
1	3I	looks good ? 
0	3I	alright . 
1	3I	put trunc the - 
1	3I	oh . that 's a great idea . 
1	3I	hats , thick sweaters . 
1	3I	large vests , heavy coats . 
1	3I	wait heavy coat then thick sweater . 
0	3I	and large vests and - 
2	3I	oh . very good . 
1	3I	oh trunc ight . 
1	3I	i trunc bucket next to plastic jug and siding or - 
1	3I	here . looks like pfft yeah . 
2	3I	or we could have buckets for those people who need to bail out their sinking - 
2	3I	boats . 
0	3I	and then um - 
1	3I	up just keep going ? yeah . okay . so we have socks . 
1	3I	shoe laces and then boots . 
1	3I	oh . look at that . 
1	3I	are we pleased with our - ? 
2	3I	i 'm good with it . 
2	3I	i think it's a mighty fine - i mean for what we had to start with , right ? trunc i mean i would never have put the mouse traps there . i 'm just 
0	3I	couldn't yeah like - hm . 
1	3I	wonder if the butter and the eggs though should go by the sugar . 
2	3I	we can call it done . 
2	3I	oh ! we didn't do the eggs . ah . okay . good point . mm-hm . 
2	3I	so it works . 
0	3I	did we move those ? or were those there ? 
0	3I	do you remember ? 
0	3I	okay . 
0	3I	oh i did . yeah . cuz i was like it doesn't fit with - 
0	3I	kay . 
2	3I	you are bad . go down there . 
1	3I	off the side . 
1	3I	okay . are we done ? 
1	3I	are you comfortable with this - ? 
1	3I	layout of our store . 
2	3I	boy it could use some colors this is really - 
0	3I	okay . 
0	3I	okay . 
1	3I	i 'm good too . we 're done . 
1	6B	we could start off with just picking some - random number . and then - 
1	6B	or we could be more - 
1	6B	appropriate and look through and see . 
2	6B	i was thinking five . 
0	6B	it's sorta in between trunc okay . 
0	6B	okay . mm-hm . 
1	6B	nope . that 's - 
1	6B	that 's and easy one for me too . okay . so that 's one . 
2	6B	mm . 
2	6B	can . 
2	6B	but - we don't - have to - discuss that too much . cuz i agree with you . trunc trunc no - like that 's - i 'm - 
2	6B	i 'm a social worker for goodness sakes so this is - not that i - i mean i do like football too . except - 
2	6B	well . oh god , here we go . 
2	6B	um . depends on what it is . if we say okay the football equipment is just to upgrade the stuff they already have and the stuff is pretty darn good . 
2	6B	then again , if it's these brand new helmets for - you know - to supposedly minimize the um - 
0	6B	the um - yeah - uh - 
0	6B	concussion . 
0	6B	issue . 
0	6B	bookkeeping . 
2	6B	i think - i mean i 'd if we have to cut stuff . and to me i think assistant cooks - 
2	6B	unfortunately . i mean i know that 's a job for those people . i mean but some of this is jobs for everybody and we just - 
1	6B	i think so . 
0	6B	poetry books . exactly . 
0	6B	so . 
0	6B	let's see bookkeeping . music . 
2	6B	let's trunc let's see the most important for me i guess would be sex ed . keep it . 
2	6B	math tutor . 
0	6B	um . 
2	6B	of course i 'll speech therapy . 
2	6B	i mean acting coach i could see if it comes - you know if we don't - i could see that - trunc that kinda going away . i mean if you have a drama - 
2	6B	the - the you know . anyway . that trunc that could go uh - 
2	6B	it's a lesser than a - er - special ed teacher and uh - i think note takers for disability services are very important . and music teachers i think are important 
1	6B	so then assistant cooks . assistant cooks . 
1	6B	uh . football equipment . 
1	6B	pardon me . juice . 
2	6B	bookkeeping . that 's four . and then - acting coaches . that would be my five i guess . 
2	6B	sorry . i 'm not a fan of poetry but i don't wanna take poetry away from the child that might be interested in it . assuming it's for children . 
0	6B	so . 
1	6B	it's an important . yeah . 
0	6B	okay 
2	6B	oh , here we go . yes . 
2	6B	i know . i know . 
1	6B	yes . 
2	6B	i know - it's like i should - five . why did i do that ! ? 
2	6B	why did we choose five ! ? okay but - let's see . 
2	6B	yes . bagels gone . 
2	6B	it's low on the - 
0	6B	mm-kay . um 
2	6B	one would hope . 
2	6B	but - 
2	6B	it's sorta like if people already have - 
2	6B	are they are - they are different . but . okay . 
2	6B	a budget that 's - yeah . weed control and , unfortunately , invasive species removal . 
1	6B	i would - think um - 
2	6B	that 's true . or they could focus on those - 
0	6B	those invasive weeds . 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	bagel factory 
2	6B	i know . um . 
0	6B	hospital additions . did we talk about that ? 
2	6B	oh trunc how bout we just put it in . 
2	6B	the usual terms of all the hospitals . at least here at the u_ dub and they just - you know - they can get money from the gates foundation or somebody else . who cares about the trunc not that they don't care but - 
2	6B	we 'll just say that . 
2	6B	yeah . not around here . maybe in the south . 
0	6B	bagels . 
0	6B	um . 
0	6B	weed control . that 's four . 
0	6B	um . 
2	6B	well . i 'm sorry but i would go to invasive species next . because i mean plants are important but people are more important i mean i - uh - so - 
2	6B	but then i 'm concerned about the egg farm regulations because of - so many people eat eggs and if we 're talking about salmonella and stuff . 
0	6B	if um - 
2	6B	yes . okay . that 's five . that 's good . 
2	6B	there 's pass the buck . 
1	6B	mm-kay . 
1	6B	yep . 
1	6B	works for me for - 
0	6B	mm-kay . 
0	6B	alright . 
2	6B	i think i know one we might agree on at first but - 
1	6B	could that be the second from the bottom ? or were you thinking something else ? 
2	6B	i was thinking football stadium upkeep . we don't have poor people . 
0	6B	um . 
0	6B	so public access is like - 
0	6B	p_b_s_ , right ? 
0	6B	trunc public news is like n_p_r_ ? i mean , just what's the difference between public access and public news ? 
0	6B	oh . 
2	6B	scary . 
2	6B	i don't think we need that . 
1	6B	okay . 
1	6B	and there 'snational 
0	6B	stations . but that - then again that would be like - that 's like getting rid of k_u_o_w_ right ? yeah . mm-kay . 
0	6B	football stadium 
0	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	oh , not puppies though . 
1	6B	but yeah , the - 
2	6B	and it doesn't actually because people are so - 
2	6B	irresponsible with their animals that - and or they - 
2	6B	especially on your side of the mountains . 
2	6B	i ain't gonna do that to my dog 
1	6B	food bank is important . 
0	6B	okay 
2	6B	yep . then there 's boy's basketball club . but that 's just boys . junior soccer league is for - both . 
1	6B	i would think . 
0	6B	veterinary hospital 
2	6B	i mean it sound - there 's this theme here - i mean of - i mean you 've got stray cat spaying , kitten and puppy adoption , dog catcher , and veterinary hospital . and it's like whoa are they having a serious issue with - or they just want to like - 
2	6B	so let's just - let's just hypothesize that there 's a fine - 
2	6B	animal hospital and so i would say let's not expand . i mean that and that 's a huge chuck of change - uh capital . trunc yeah . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	football stadiums that can 
1	6B	i - yeah . 
2	6B	well , almost . 
3	6B	i 'm a - i 'm a major animal advocate so i 'm not so sure about that but - but yes , when it comes down to this . but - 
0	6B	um . 
1	6B	but i think - do we have four ? yeah . say the vet hospital now . 
0	6B	um . 
0	6B	a public - 
0	6B	access station ? 
0	6B	that 's three . 
1	6B	and dog catcher maybe ? 
0	6B	i - i 'm a - 
0	6B	that 's all we need two more . oh . um . 
1	6B	i mean - i guess if we have to - between stray cat spaying and kitten and puppy adoption . 
2	6B	oi . 
0	6B	oh . 
2	6B	i guess - let's - we could - i mean that we could cut the kitten and puppy adoption . i - to me i would think that would be - 
2	6B	if you 're like trying to do a campaign . 
2	6B	have them be adopted . there we go . 
2	6B	i think stray cat spaying's more important . 
1	6B	to keep the number of - 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	mm-kay . 
0	6B	is that four okay . 
0	6B	um . 
0	6B	did we talk about the reusable bag campaign ? 
0	6B	i know . 
2	6B	i guess to me on the - you know on maslow's hierarchy - it's sort of like - 
2	6B	because we live in this world and we are rich enough to talk about how we don't like plastic bags we can - not - we can do this so - i um - 
2	6B	i mean , as much as - again i 'm like - you know - the total green - 
2	6B	wash out my ziploc bags and all that . if there 's something we have to cut 
2	6B	i mean if we cut pest control that could be really bad for everybody . and you 're right , i - i mean the boy's basketball club , the junior soccer league , those things are very important for kids . 
0	6B	to - 
2	6B	for public health and safety . even though - you know - in a way - keep kids interested in - 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	yep . got our five there ? okay . 
2	6B	oh boy . now this . 
0	6B	okay . 
0	6B	subway system . okay . 
0	6B	mm . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	subway system . i mean it all depends on what it is but that 's - 
2	6B	i mean to me it's like you just i mean these - the numbers are so - you know - flag pole maintenance is probably what ? twenty thousand and a subway system is eighteen million . so - but - who knows ? it just , that 's trunc totally expensive thing . um . 
1	6B	i 'm not saying keep it or leave it . it does seems a little on the - 
2	6B	sorta frivolous but then so does tattoo artist trunc but no it's not - 
2	6B	licensing is important cuz you don't want - 
2	6B	all the tattoo artists not being licensed for obviously healthy reasons and things but - 
0	6B	hm . alright . 
0	6B	taxi stops . what's that mean ? do you think ? 
0	6B	taxi stops . 
0	6B	okay . 
1	6B	they don't have any . 
2	6B	flag pole repair is one that 's easy . 
0	6B	mm . 
2	6B	but aren't there private - ? 
2	6B	like triple a_ and private companies so 
2	6B	that do that . 
1	6B	yeah . 
0	6B	they did - mm-hm . 
0	6B	they just - private that goes and gets it - and they get - yeah . 
1	6B	okay . 
0	6B	mm . 
2	6B	i think we have enough speed limit signs . 
1	6B	they don't light up and - change . 
1	6B	let's do a happy - 
0	6B	um . 
2	6B	minimize the number of - hunting tags as - as opposed to increase the number - i 'm - cut it . 
2	6B	if it means eliminate - you know we 're gonna have a little n_r_a_ issue i think . and people but - uh . 
2	6B	i 'm - hunting tags outta here - 
1	6B	for me . 
1	6B	yes . it's not moose season . 
0	6B	um . 
0	6B	okay . now . 
1	6B	my public bus upkeep has to be done to keep up the busses . that was very um . 
1	6B	taxis . did we - do taxi stops ? cuz i still don't know if they are - 
1	6B	un . yeah . 
0	6B	yeah . yeah . 
1	6B	mm-hm . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	well what - and then just looking at - see when they say massage certificates it's sorta like what ? are we is the city in - or this - department in the business of training trunc trunc massage therapists to get trunc ? cuz it says - as opposed to licensing but i 'm assuming it's licensing . or certifying . same with trunc then i - i think that 's important . and keeping the teaching . 
1	6B	okay .
