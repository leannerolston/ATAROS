2	3I	well - or it - cooking supplies . is there household cooking ? i mean -

1	3I	mm-hm . 
2	3I	we got a problem with refrigerator magnets . 
0	3I	um . 
0	3I	yeah , they did . they did . so we 've got all the clothing .

2	6B	oh , no . we can't cut that . 
0	6B	acti- 
0	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	for blind students or trunc yeah . yeah . yeah . 
2	6B	football equipment . 
2	6B	i could go with sugar free juice machines . i 'm not sure about the assistant cooks . because we 're talking about the school lunches , and the thing is that educational programs have so many um , free and reduced lunch programs . 
2	6B	and breakfast programs . so , yeah . 
2	6B	that 's right . i agree with that . 
1	6B	what about acting coaches ? 
1	6B	it is . 
1	6B	yeah . 
1	6B	okay . okay . 
0	6B	mm-hm . 
1	6B	uh-huh . 
1	6B	okay . 
2	6B	uh , football equipment . 
2	6B	or i 've worked at university for too long . okay . 
1	6B	can see if there are two . okay . 
0	6B	hospital additions . 
2	6B	why ? 
0	6B	mm-hm . 
1	6B	mm-hm . 
2	6B	yeah . and it's um - it is important . 
2	6B	uh - all of them kind of are important . but i suppose - 
2	6B	um . i mean , if i knew more about bagel factories , i would know how important , um , the inspections are . why that is picked . is it  picked ? did they stick it on there just because it was a stand-out that was an obvious one ? 
2	6B	but all the rest of em , um - yeah . 
2	6B	that 's one i was thinking about . 
2	6B	we just don't know the situation . if - yeah . 
2	6B	we need that . yeah . 
1	6B	bagel . the bagel factory inspections . and the hospital additions . yeah . 
2	6B	definitely there 's no , um - 
2	6B	i mean , we 're assuming that each one of em has the same monetary value , which is hardly the fact , but that 's okay . okay . so on to recreation and public services . 
1	6B	yeah . 
2	6B	well , i could probably vote for football stadium upkeep , if we 're gonna vote for football equipment . on the other hand , we may be making enemies by totally attacking the football folks . if we gave them their stadium upkeep , 
2	6B	they may forgive us . i was wondering - there 's like four things for animals . stray cats , trunc kitten and puppy adoption , dog catcher , and then veterinary hospital . 
2	6B	so , i 'm wondering why the county needs a veterinary hospital . 
2	6B	or does it need the hospital for the spaying and the - 
1	6B	i don't know . i 'm - i 'm not sure a county needs a veterinary hospital . 
2	6B	well my son played soccer . yeah . 
2	6B	well i would rather have kids off the street and into strong sports , and have trunc more stray cats , i guess . 
2	6B	we need that , don't we ? yeah ? 
1	6B	food bank we need . 
0	6B	which of those things can people do without the county funding them ? i guess . 
1	6B	maybe kitten and puppy adoption ? reusable bag campaign ? 
1	6B	maybe . 
2	6B	yeah . that doesn't  require the county . okay . 
1	6B	okay . 
1	6B	okay . 
2	6B	that 's right . that 's trunc and the families can , yeah . 
0	6B	mm-hm . 
0	6B	mm-kay . 
2	6B	i think that 's probably too . and i 'm thinking taxi stops . do we  need taxi stops ? does the  county need to provide those ? 
1	6B	uh-huh . 
2	6B	uh-huh . that 's true . that 's true . i agree with you , yeah . okay . 
1	6B	so do we need to go back and do any more ? okay . i think we 're done , heather . yeah . 
2	6B	we wanna not eliminate any more than we have to .
