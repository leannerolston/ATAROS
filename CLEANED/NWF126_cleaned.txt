1	6B	here ?
1	6B	i do n't think we need a public news station .
2	6B	i do n't think that 's what that is .
2	6B	that says a station .
2	6B	a specific station .
1	6B	cuz when they put out the amber alerts it goes out trunc on all stations .
1	6B	and - and - each - each -
1	6B	like komo and king and all those , those are privately owned , but they each have their own traffic .

1	6B	and they - and the cars are n't drivable ?
1	6B	or - or -
2	6B	yeah , but you have to pay em .
1	6B	or - or - or trunc or parking .
1	6B	with -
1	6B	you know , abandoned vehicles .
1	6B	i would think it would be the same thing as a license .
0	6B	would n't it ?
1	6B	massage therapists are licensed .
2	6B	well , it would be like a teaching trunc you do have to go through a test . you have to go through -
