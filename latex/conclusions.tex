\section{Conclusions} 

Within corpus, but across tasks, categorical features outperform unigrams for both stance presence and stance strength prediction, but only those models trained on the 3I task actually beat the max-class baseline. Across corpora, these same results apply, however, categorical models show a gain over the max-class baseline only for the prediction of stance presence.  As for feature values, proportional feature values show a slight advantage over binary feature values for stance presence both within corpus and cross-corpus; binary features showed better performance for stance strength detection, however, recall that this was well below the max-class baseline.
